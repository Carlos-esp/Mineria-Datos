country,description,variety
Mexico,"Initially hard, rooty aromas of leather and horsehide transition to cassis, raspberry and plum if given time. The palate on this is a bit rough and tannic, but there's also solid berry fruit and a moderately baked finish with a rubbery feel to give it character.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Mexico,"While this wine is unoaked, it still carries a strong whiff of sulfur and popcorn that doesn't really dissipate. The palate offers good feel and is balanced between weight and acidity. Flavors of melon and applesauce are round and end in a swirl of sweet pear.",Chardonnay
Mexico,"Mocha, coffee, leather, brandied red fruit and a grassy aroma define the bouquet on this sweet, ripe-tasting Cabernet that's full of cherry and candied berry flavors. A sweet, jammy finish has a little burn to offer.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Mexico,"This fiery Grenache delivers heat, bold fruit and cured meat aromas on what amounts to a flaming bouquet. Red fruit flavors dominate this forceful wine, while the finish turns meaty and salty tasting.",Grenache
Mexico,"Hot, syrupy aromas are rooty and intense. This Nebbiolo offers plum, raspberry and red currant flavors offset by tomato and noticeable oak. The finish is propelled by acidity and carries tangy flavors of roasted tomato and plum.",Nebbiolo
Mexico,"This is a blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Moscato that's yeasty and oaky on the nose. The mouth is creamy and home to apple, vanilla and oxidized afterflavors. There's enough solid pear and melon involved to make it worthwhile, but you can't miss the mature nature of the wine.",White Blend
Mexico,"Flat early aromas seem smoky at first and then more like apple and papaya. This is a plump Sauvignon Blanc with mouthfilling weight; it's a touch mealy in flavor, and no particular fruits stick out. It's fine, but short on character.",Sauvignon Blanc
Mexico,"This is a muscular, concentrated wine with no shortage of horsepower. In the mouth, it's rather loud and acidic. But flavors of smoky black fruits, vanilla and toast are good and finish spicy. This is heavy and rough by global standards, but it has good fruit and isn't timid.",Shiraz
Mexico,"This opens with hard-capped aromas of crusty mineral and reedy berry. The flavors are gamy and roasted, with brandied plum and cherry accents. The finish is bright in feel and runs long with an herbal raspberry flavor.",Nebbiolo
Mexico,"Mild hints of tropical fruit are less than convincing. The palate on this Sauvignon Blanc is round, weighty and offers quiet flavors of melon and spiced apple. The finish remains soft and a touch bitter.",Sauvignon Blanc
Mexico,"Price aside, this is a ponderous wine with rooty aromas of Dr. Pepper mixed with burnt toast, coffee and baked berry fruits. It's very rich and syrupy in the mouth, while caramel, chocolate and baked berry flavors bring this overripe wine to rest.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Mexico,"Oxidized cherry and strawberry aromas settle on heavy and candied upon airing. This is thick and plump stuff, with sweet red-fruit flavors and seemingly a lot of residual sugar. This needs more spine and structure.",Rosé
Mexico,"This odd blend of Barbera, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Sirah and Zinfandel is earthy and mulchy on the nose, with coffee and compost aromas. It never finds much freshness as the flavors suggest compost and leafiness.",Red Blend
Mexico,"This Chardonnay is a touch volatile on the nose, which deals some gym sweat and brine. Eventually things break down to dusty, soft white-fruit aromas. Flavors of banana, papaya and white pepper end with tropical notes. This is just good enough.",Chardonnay
Mexico,"Lafarga's wines are expensive and shoot high, but they are awfully rustic in general. This Syrah is earthy and rubbery on the nose, then hard as rocks on the palate due to clamp-down tannins. Flavors of dark fruits, plastic and oak finish with heat.",Syrah
Mexico,"This oaky wine opens with a huge pop of toasty, burnt aromas. It's resiny feeling, with a creamy palate. Hard time spent in Hungarian barrels has resulted in flavors of toasty apple, cinnamon and peppery spices. This lacks harmony.",Chardonnay
Mexico,"Fiery, punchy aromas of red berries and herbaceous plants make for a rough start. Flavors of leafy red raspberry and plum are typical for basic Merlot, while the finish is juicy in feel, with herbal, leafy, lightly cooked flavors.",Merlot
Mexico,"This is rooty and leafy on the nose, with dry raspberry and root beer aromas. There's a compost-like undercurrent to this wine that's highlighted via leafy, herbal flavors and a baked, earthy finish.",Tempranillo
Mexico,"This is fairly hard and fiery on the nose. The palate is tough and the wine smacks around rather than flows easily. With only modest acidity, it's not that lively.",Rosé
Mexico,"The white wines from Garza do not equal their reds. This Chardonnay is muddled on the nose, with corn and oxidized apple aromas. Earthy flavors of bland fruits are saved by a respectable mouthfeel.",Chardonnay
Mexico,"Dense, heavy and meaty on the nose, this has stewed plum and earth notes. Heavy tannins make it grabby, while the flavors suggest stewed black fruits. Roasted tasting, it hits hard on the finish. Entirely different from Italian Nebbiolo.",Nebbiolo
Mexico,"Overtly simple and drying, this has crisp acidity and oily flavors of popcorn and tart white fruits. It finishes with citrus and astringency. This would likely be better with seafood or salad than on its own.",Sauvignon Blanc
Mexico,"Smoky, oaky and peppery up front, with balsamic berry aromas and tree bark notes. It feels thick, creamy and a little awkward, with heavy oak flavors, related spice and savory, stewy notes. As it unwinds it's chunky and heavy, with a sweet molasses note on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Mexico,"Hot and heavy from first whiff, this has plastic and red pepper notes, with a sweet strawberry aroma. It's thick as syrup on the palate, with extracted, fully ripe flavors of blackberry and raisin. Maat means “the land” in a native language; but it could mean syrupy sweet. Hard to believe this is just 13.5% abv.",Grenache
Mexico,"This wine opens with pepper, leather and stalky berry aromas. It feels sticky in the mouth, with stalky, buttery berry flavors that fall off rather quickly. Sweet but that's about it on the finish. Tempranillo, Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre.",Red Blend
Mexico,"This has aromas of smashed berry and red licorice candy. It feels raspy and resiny, with flavors of toasted oak and jammy blueberry and raspberry. It's wiry and lacking finesse on the finish.",Shiraz
Mexico,"Waxy smelling and gritty, with an oily overtone, this feels O.K. but sort of wayward, with flavors of bitter grapefruit and matchstick. Simple and somewhat sour on the finish.",Chardonnay
Mexico,"This is nutty and minerally on the nose, and barely citric as far as fruit aromas go. On the palate, there's bitterness, with a grapefruit tang making up the flavor profile. A blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay.",White Blend
Mexico,"Baked and bricky smelling, with notes of applesauce and blueberry. It feels snappy with edgy tannins. Cranberry and spice flavors lead to a scouring finish; 100% Carignan.",Carignan
Mexico,"Simple pear flavors, joined by a hint of butter. A bit thick and heavy, but it makes for a mouthfilling white.",Chardonnay
Mexico,"A world-class wine regardless of origin, this Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Tempranillo and Zinfandel blend is as full as they come, with alluring black cherry, cola and graphite aromas. The mouthfeel is smooth and rich, with a wave of cola, molasses and chocolate along with black cherry and blackberry. Sweet, dark, smoky and long on the finish. Drink now–2014.",Red Blend
Mexico,"This red blend of 67% Syrah and 33% Mourvedre immediately announces itself as serious and classy. The bouquet is layered with berry fruit and baking spice aromas that aren't hard or pushy. It feels stout and secure, with its structure supporting flavors of concentrated berry, pepper and baking spice. The long finish keeps its form. Drink now–2015.",Syrah-Mourvèdre
Mexico,"Ripe and rich, but not dull or out of whack, this smells sweet, a little soupy and densely fruity, with a cumin accent. It feels concentrated and full bodied, with black fruit flavors of roasted plum and blackberry. It's mellow, dealing brown sugar on the finish. This is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Tempranillo; drink now–2013.",Red Blend
Mexico,"A blend of Tempranillo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Grenache and Cinsault, this smells spicy and earthy, with cola, leather and dusty berry aromas. Focused and pure feeling, it bears flavors of berry, plum, cherry, caramel and vanilla cream. Lightly stewed on the finish, but it's excellent overall. Drink now–2015.",Red Blend
Mexico,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Grenache is clean, pure and 100% balanced. Aromas of fresh berry, rubber and baking spice lead to berry, plum and chocolate flavors. Smooth on the finish, with purity and length.",Red Blend
Mexico,"Tight, earthy and focused up front, this has attractive berry and cola aromas. It feels jammy, flush and lush, then tastes equally jammy and rich, with plum and berry flavors that seem baked and warm. Candied tasting on the finish, but fresh enough in feel. This is a blend of Tempranillo, Grenache and Carignan.",Red Blend
Mexico,"Arguably Baja's best varietal Tempranillo, this 350-case production is round, clean and fruity on the bouquet, with brown sugar and molasses along with big black-fruit aromas. It feels full, tannic and balanced, with sweet plum, chocolate and berry-syrup flavors. This is more than generous on the finish. Drink now–2014.",Tempranillo
Mexico,"Sweet, earthy and dry smelling, with tobacco and savory soy aromas. Tomatoey acids pushing raspberry, plum, vanilla and tobacco flavors. Oak-based vanilla and tomato flavors are also present on the finish, which is fresh and lively. Only 250 cases made.",Red Blend
Mexico,"Roasted berry, dry oak, bacon, leather, graphite and spice aromas come together on the nose. It feels jammy, thick and chewy, with full tannins setting up flavors of baked berry and molasses. It finishes similarly, with a rich, full texture and a candied flavor. This is a blend of 80% Cabernet Franc and 10% each Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Mexico,"This is light on the nose, with almost airy aromas of raspberry and cherry. Fuller and more grabby in the mouth, it has firm tannins and sweet flavors of berry and cherry darkened by a toasty accent. A little fiery on the finish, it has mild heat that food will tame.",Red Blend
Mexico,"Relying on fruit from the Guadalupe and Santo Tomás valleys, this wine shows a core red-berry aroma that settles on cassis and cherry notes. It's bright, acidic and fruity, with wild berry, plum and brown sugar flavors. This is long and powerful on the finish due to its juicy acidity.",Syrah
Mexico,"This is spicy and dusty on the nose, with a hint of agave and roasted berry aromas. Feels full, good and zesty, with driving black-cherry, plum and raspberry flavors. It shows herbal shadings and fresh tomato on the finish. This is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon with Syrah and Carignan.",Cabernet Blend
Mexico,"The apple and popcorn aromas are good, and the wine was never aged in a barrel. It feels crisp and flinty, with excellent cut and acidity. Flavors of lemon and tangerine lead to a long, citrusy finish with snap and tang.",Chardonnay
Mexico,"Tropical aromas of lychee and green banana are clean and inviting. The palate feels lifted, fresh and easygoing, with lychee, banana and pear flavors. It finishes pure and fairly long.",Muscatel
Mexico,"Spicy and exotic smelling, this bears aromas of tobacco, blueberry and cumin. It feels heavy, grabby and supertannic, with mildly herbal flavors of peppery berry fruit and chocolate. Prune, berry and earth notes work the finish on this meaty, tannic big boy.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Mexico,"Winemaker/owner Pau Pijoan's tribute to fast, fun cars is encapsulated in this racy red blend of Ruby Cabernet (motor), Petit Sirah (turbo charger), Barbera (transmission) and Colombard (suspension). It's strapping and shows a lot of acid, while the flavors of berry, cherry and chocolate are good but monotone. This is fruity, flavorful and not complicated.",Red Blend
Mexico,"The peach, pear and apple aromas get no interference from oak. The mouthfeel is friendly, while flavors of green melon, pear and spice work well together. It finishes sweet but with a touch of spice and vanilla.",White Blend
Mexico,"Here's a true Sauvignon Blanc with spunky green aromas and plenty of grapefruit. It feels citric and lemony on the tongue, with citrusy flavors of tangerine and lime. It finishes tight and zesty, like a good Sauvignon Blanc should.",Sauvignon Blanc
Mexico,"This is slightly stalky and burnt smelling, with briary aromas. It feels choppy, with roasted flavors of plum and berry. It finishes with the same herbal, Bordeaux-style flavors that give the palate an Old World character. Not as good as the 2008.",Red Blend
Mexico,"Opaque in color, with smoky aromas of bacon, berry purée, latex and dried herbs. Feels saturated and grapy, with big, plodding tannins in front of soft, stewed flavors of blackberry and prune. Darkens up on what amounts to a soft finish. Pure Grenache.",Grenache
Mexico,"Neutral on the bouquet, this has clean, stony aromas that set up a surprisingly plump palate with melon and lychee flavors. It finishes a bit soft, but with more than acceptable acidity. It won't age for too long, but it sure tastes good now.",White Blend
Mexico,"Dense cherry, plum and black currant aromas carry a note of latex as well as bacon. Feels fiery and powerful, not elegant or lifted, with untamed, slightly syrupy flavors of plum, berry, chocolate and cough medicine. Powerful Shiraz that seems more boozy than its listed 14% abv.",Shiraz
Mexico,"Dense, heavy and meaty on the nose, this has stewed plum and earth notes. Heavy tannins make it grabby, while the flavors suggest stewed black fruits. Roasted tasting, it hits hard on the finish. Entirely different from Italian Nebbiolo.",Nebbiolo
Mexico,"Overtly simple and drying, this has crisp acidity and oily flavors of popcorn and tart white fruits. It finishes with citrus and astringency. This would likely be better with seafood or salad than on its own.",Sauvignon Blanc
Mexico,"Smoky, oaky and peppery up front, with balsamic berry aromas and tree bark notes. It feels thick, creamy and a little awkward, with heavy oak flavors, related spice and savory, stewy notes. As it unwinds it's chunky and heavy, with a sweet molasses note on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Mexico,"Hot and heavy from first whiff, this has plastic and red pepper notes, with a sweet strawberry aroma. It's thick as syrup on the palate, with extracted, fully ripe flavors of blackberry and raisin. Maat means “the land” in a native language; but it could mean syrupy sweet. Hard to believe this is just 13.5% abv.",Grenache
Mexico,"This wine opens with pepper, leather and stalky berry aromas. It feels sticky in the mouth, with stalky, buttery berry flavors that fall off rather quickly. Sweet but that's about it on the finish. Tempranillo, Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre.",Red Blend

Mexico,"Baked and bricky smelling, with notes of applesauce and blueberry. It feels snappy with edgy tannins. Cranberry and spice flavors lead to a scouring finish; 100% Carignan.",Carignan
Mexico,"Slightly sweet on the nose, but wheaty and grassy too. It tastes like clay and bubble gum, with a touch of peach and citrus. It's acidic on the finish.",Cinsault
Mexico,"Briary on the nose, this has disjointed aromas of plum, cinnamon and wet cement. It's jumpy, acidic and not very well balanced, with tart red-plum and cherry flavors. It feels edgy and gritty, with an almost sour finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
