Germany,"Bold in body and richly, almost viscously, textured, this is one powerful dry Riesling. Lime and lime zest seem to percolate from nose to finish, imbuing a citrus sheen over layers of mineral and wet stone. It's brawny and intense, yet elegant throughout.",Riesling
Germany,"Dusty mineral and herbaceous green notes juxtapose curiously with slightly overripe apple and peach flavors on the palate of this dry Riesling. Soft tangerine acidity lends a sunny, refreshing tone on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"While fresh pink grapefruit and Meyer lemon notes shine brightly on the nose and palate of this off-dry Riesling, there's a touch of savory allium that distracts. It's a juicy easygoing wine with approachably soft, sunny acidity. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Blue Fish Riesling consistently stuns in a blind-tasting lineup. It's dry in style yet intensely sunny and ripe, brimming with yellow-cherry and cashew-nut richness. Supple and silky on the palate, it's a spectacular value that's likely to surprise.",Riesling
Germany,"Delicate effervescence and blossomy perfume mark this brut-style Riesling modeled after Italian Prosecco. It's an apt comparison, actually, with its subtle sweetness and forward floral style. Fun and flighty on the palate, it's an easy-to-drink quaffer at an easy price.",Riesling
Germany,"While pressed apple and pear notes are ripe and concentrated, whiffs of allium and earth lend a savory, shadowy tone to this wine. Regardless, it's refreshing and dry in composure with moderately long length.",Riesling

Germany,"Juicy and ripe with flavors of peach, tangerine and apple, this is an easy-drinking, off-dry Riesling. Delicately structured, it finishes moderately long with a pleasantly bitter lime pith note.",Riesling
Germany,Lusciously jammy notes of preserved black cherry and raspberry are forward and friendly in this simple yet consistent Pinot Noir. It's briskly balanced in acidity and wraps up neatly on the finish. Drink now.,Pinot Noir

Germany,"A standout among an excellent lineup of 2014 grosses gewächs from Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt, this gorgeously textured wine is as light as a feather, yet with a distinctly luscious cling. Dry but pentratingly fruity, it contrasts ripe peach and grapefruit flavors against laser-sharp edges of acidity and minerality. Drinks beautifully now but should continue to please well into the next decade.",Riesling
Germany,"Green, herbal notes are prominent on this brisk, savory Riesling. Lemony acidity and hints of bitter lime pith add a stark, refreshing quality that would accompany rich goat cheese or cured meats quite well.",Riesling
Germany,"So lusciously ripe, with notes of mango and guava, this is an explosion of sweet fruit, honey and flowers. Searing citrus acidity cuts through the palate, highlighting layers of crushed stone and tea leaf that add complexity. It's so exquisitely delicate, but lingers endlessly on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Billowing with scents of marmalade, wildflower honey and raspberry preserves, this is an intoxicatingly perfumed TBA, but the palate doesn't disappoint either. Rich and creamy with undulating streaks of peach preserve and tangerine, it lingers on and on, with its tea and honey-kissed finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Aromas of mango and candied-orange rind lend a heady tropical feel to this concentrated TBA full of peach and marmalade flavors. Unctuous with sweet nectar, yet exquisitely dainty on the palate, it quivers with tangerine acidity and a finish that's laced with saffron and honey.",Riesling
Germany,"This intensely fruity, floral nectar hits the palate with electric force, catapulting vibrant acidity against sweet, tangy flavors of tangerine, peach and honey. A favorite amidst an excellent showing of 2014 Mosel spätlese, it's delicious now, but should continue to evolve well through at least 2020.",Riesling
Germany,"Tasted five years after bottling, this profoundly elegant spätlese exhibits a minerality that penetrates through layers of fruit and honey. Struck flint and slate offer dark counterpoints to a lush, creamy palate full of ripe tangerine and apple marmalade flavors. It's a penetrating, deftly balanced wine that's both stimulating and thought-provoking. Drink now through 2021.",Riesling
Germany,"Bursting of sweet yellow cherries, tangerines and peaches, this fragrant, finely filigreed spätlese screams classic Mosel.

It's stunning now, but has plenty of stuffing to carry through 2025 with aplomb.",Riesling
Germany,"Zesty orange and honey notes are touched with saffron on this unctuous, exotically spiced TBA. Caramel and preserved-peach flavors give the palate a silky richness, but it's remarkably complex as well, with a dusty minerality and tones of tea and spice that reverberate on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Waxy honeycomb and honeysuckle aromas are laced with earth and spice on this beautifully complex beerenauslese. It's intensely sweet, with notes of caramel and peach preserves, along with savory layers of smoke and saffron. So exquisitely delicate in profile, yet effortlessly languid on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"What a bargain for such a lavishly composed beerenauslese. Aromas of honey, spice and potpourri meld seamlessly on the palate, with flavors of caramel and peach preserves. It's luxuriously rich and creamy, but brightened by streaks of lemony acidity and a tea-leaf astringency that lingers long on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Aromas of sugar cookie and apple preserves entice on this ripe, rich spätlese. It's ethereally light on the palate, but deeply concentrated, with honey and peach flavors braced by soft pink-grapefruit acidity. It finishes elegantly, with a slick of honeycomb and lavender perfume. Drink now for its floral, fruity decadence.",Riesling
Germany,"Wisps of smoke and slate extend savory, mineral contrasts to sun-kissed grapefruit and tangerine flavors in this penetrating dry Riesling. It's nervy and brisk, anchored by strikes of lime and lemon acidity and a lingering, steely finish. It's a powerful wine that should continue to improve through 2025.",Riesling
Germany,"Touches of exotic spice and crushed minerals lend complexity to sun-kissed peach and melon flavors in this medium-sweet Riesling. It's punchy and spry, full of high-toned acidity and lift, but finishes long, lean and elegant. It's youthful and exuberant now, but should continue to meld beautifully through at least 2027.",Riesling
Germany,"Swirls of rich, ripe yellow peach and orange penetrate the palate of this finely textured spätlese. It's thrilling and zesty yet lusciously juicy, finishing long with a slatey, mineral tang. It drinks beautifully now but should maintain its fresh, fruity disposition till at least 2020 and gain elegance and minerality for another decade.",Riesling

Germany,"Ripe and rich, this irresistibly fruity spätlese is concentrated with peach marmalade, guava and grapefruit flavors, but braced by a streak of lemon-lime acidity and a delicate spritz that tickles the palate. Satisfying and juicy, it finishes long with a hint of grapefruit-pith astringency.",Riesling
Germany,"Enticing scents of grapefruit zest and bees wax are fitting openers to this creamy, rich TBA full of luscious orange-marmalade flavor. Bright, brisk tangerine acidity adds freshness and levity to the palate, leading to a long, honeyed finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This is a veritable bargain for the incredible quality it delivers. It's lavishly composed, with a flurry of floral, fruity attributes—cherry blossoms, sweet peaches, and yellow plums—all kissed with honey, and a shower of lemon-lime acidity. Enjoy now for its youthful exuberance, but put a few away to see its honeyed tones darken and mature over the next decade.",Riesling
Germany,"A rich layer of caramelized honey penetrates through bristling limes, lemons and tangerines in this sprightly medium-sweet Riesling. It's light as a feather yet pulsating with sweet yellow peach and apricot flavors. Vibrantly acidic but nuanced and substantial, it drinks gorgeously now but has enough substance to age well through at least 2025.",Riesling
Germany,"Saffron and spice entice from nose to finish in this richly honeyed, yet dry Riesling. The palate is a delightful kaleidescope of fruit and mineral nuances anchored firmly by a stream of grapefruit and lime acidity. It's a complex, penetrating wine sure to improve through at least 2025.",Riesling

Germany,"Lip tingling lime acidity sends a jolt through this lusciously fruity wine. Off dry in style, it juxtaposes sweet-tart lemon and honey tangerine flavors against steely, piercing minerality.",Riesling
Germany,"Savory touches of saffron and bee pollen lend complexity to this lithe, dancing spätlese. It's intensely sunny in character, bursting of honey and sweet tangerine flavors, yet held firm and tight by a backbone of reverberating lemon acidity. Drink now through 2021.",Riesling
Germany,"Crushed stone and smoke mingle with luscious stonefruit and crisp, green herb on this multifaceted auslese.

Germany,"Whiffs of saffron and honey lend a sweet, spicy tone to this off-dry Riesling.

Brisk and bright with acidity, it's effortlessly quaffable, but with refinement and depth.",Riesling

Germany,"High-toned tangerine and lime acidity cuts a sharp edge through this intensely ripe yet composed dry wine. It's zesty and green, but boasts rich yellow plum, melon and grapefruit flavors. It's delicious already but should continue to meld beautifully through 2025.",Riesling
Germany,"While it shares the same electricity and mineral finesse of Bürklin-Wolf's other 2014 Premier Cru (labeled P.C.) wines, the Rechbächel has an intensely fruity, almost tropical appeal. It's concentrated and ripe, but with cutting white grapefruit and tangerine acidity leading a long, focused finish. Drink now through 2025.",Riesling
Germany,"Whiffs of Assam tea and honey permeate throughout this bright, bristling spätlese accenting succulent yellow peach and tangerine flavors. It's vibrant and brisk, but finishes on a sweet, meandering marmalade kiss. Stunning already but structured enough to evolve beautifully through at least 2025.",Riesling
Germany,"Hints of dusty mineral and caramelized sugar lend complexity to deep, penetrating layers of honey, peach and yellow plum in this light-footed, yet resounding, kabinett.

Germany,"Sweet and savory interplay through this exotic TBA, balancing waves of candied orange rind and caramelized sugar with umami-rich notes of sea breeze and dried herb. It's delicate on the palate, but lingers long with bright tangerine acidity. Delicious now, but would be fascinating to try in 10 years.",Riesling
Germany,"Fresh herbs and florals brighten the nose of this exceptionally balanced Riesling. It's dry in style, yet intensely fruity, with bursts of pink grapefruit and guava that extend through a lush, creamy palate. Drink now through 2014 for its bright, floral exuberance.",Riesling
Germany,"This Riesling is exotic, with whiffs of rose petal and evergreen against a backdrop of white peach and yellow-cherry flavors. It's delicately structured, with soft, pink-grapefruit acidity that draws out honey and tea notes on the finish. It's gorgeous now, but should gain earthy complexity as it ages over the next 10 years.",Riesling
Germany,"Hints of saffron and pollen lend spice and earthiness to this spine tingling but juicy spätlese full of zesty tangerine, lime and yellow peach flavors. It's sheer and spry initially, but builds in fruity, mineral intensity through a long, lingering finish. Drink now through 2025.",Riesling
Germany,"Deep veins of citrus—white grapefruit, lemon and lime—pulsate through this vibrant, spine-tingling Riesling. It's delicately framed, glazed by a sheen of honey and hibiscus nectar, yet remarkably complex, touched by pollen and dusty mineral tones. Juicy and thirst quenching yet deeply satisfying.",Riesling
Germany,"While gossamer-light in texture, this intensely sun-kissed spätlese builds in fruity, floral exuberance. Tropical mango and melon flavors are almost ruddy in richness but offset by an electric jolt of acidity. The finish is long and persistent, marked by tea leaves and lavender. Drink now through 2020.",Riesling
Germany,"Fresh green floral and lime zest lend vibe to this fine-footed, almost feather-textured kabinett. It's spry but surprisingly powerful, amplified by soaring grapefruit acidity and penetrating green-apple and pear flavors. Finishes long with a delicately honeyed touch. Drink now through 2021.",Riesling
Germany,"Swathes of freshly cut herbs and blossom perfume zesty grapefruit and honeydew flavors in this dry, deftly balanced wine. Bracing acidity invigorates and amplifies its crystalline demeanor, extending a long, mineral finish. It drinks well now, but should improve through 2025.",Riesling
Germany,"Savory aromas of lemon and crushed mineral transition into gorgeously ?floral, fruity flavors that dominate the palate of this intensely concentrated auslese. Citrusy acidity cuts through layers of sweet yellow cherry and quince paste, accenting a soft, floral finish.",Riesling

Germany,"Notes of honeycomb and sugar cookie add a caramelized warmth to ripe tangerine and peach aromas on this aromatic Riesling sparkler. It's intensely floral and fruity on the palate, but with hints of maturity and a laser-sharp acidity that cuts through rich, foamy mousse.",Riesling
Germany,"A delicate floral perfume mingles with apple and lemon aromas that carry through to the palate. Lusciously ripe, with flavors of white peach and yellow cherry, it's brightened by soft pink-grapefruit acidity. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"From red slate vineyards in Erden and Ürzig, this is a medium-bodied dry Riesling that delivers bold pineapple, apple and citrus notes accented by hints of dry spices. The zesty acids impart a tongue-tingling quality to the long finish. Drink now–2013.",Riesling
Germany,"Schiefer means “slate,” but this wine's stoniness is softer, less severe than that, cushioned under layers of superripe pear and spices that resemble cinnamon or clove and ginger. There's ample weight and richness on the palate despite a sense of dryness, and the wine finishes long, with hints of ripe peach.",Riesling
Germany,"The 2009 Abtsberg Superior is inferior to its Herrenberg counterpart, but remains a very good wine. Hints of sweat and wet stones mark the nose, while the fruit is more expressive on the palate, coming across as greengage plum and bright citrus. Medium bodied; crisp on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine makes an interesting contrast to the estate's GG from the Wallhausen Johannisberg—it's seemingly much tighter. There's passion fruit and fern fronds, wrapped in crisp acids that leave the wine finishing long, but tart and scoury.",Riesling
Germany,"Floral and perfumed for a Rheingau Riesling, reminiscent of lilacs at first, and later developing wet stone and ripe apple nuances. This is medium bodied and truly on the dry side, with a refreshing, citrusy finish.",Riesling
Germany,"With its moderate alcohol level and bold aromas of lime sherbet, this would be interesting to try alongside some dry Australian Rieslings. It has a slightly velvety texture, which might set it apart, but also shows that bright citrus line from start to finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Fairly dry in style, with apple and pear flavors that are ripe without being sweet, and brought home by steely acids and tart citrus fruit. Drink this medium-bodied Riesling over the next year or two.",Riesling
Germany,"Nicely balanced, with pleasant petrol and slate characters on the nose and honey, peach and mineral notes on the palate. It's medium in body, ending on a harmoniously ambiguous edge that asks the question: dry or sweet?",Riesling
Germany,"Loosen's Grosses Gewächs bottling from old vines is plump, custardy and slightly sweet-tasting, buoyed by ample ripe apple and peach flavors and tinged with hints of lime, fern fronds and crushed stone. It might well have been more impressive served in a different (sweeter) flight; in this context it seemed slightly soft.",Riesling
Germany,"For a 2008, this seems to be developing rather quickly, showing toasty notes that emerge on the nose, expand on the palate and jump out on the finish, largely overshadowing the admirable citrus and crushed-stone elements. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Fresh and zesty for a Rheingau trocken, with petrol and slate aromas and lime and green apple flavors that could come straight out of the Mosel. It's a refreshing, lightweight quaffer.",Riesling
Germany,"An open and inviting dry Riesling, medium bodied and plump, with tree fruits like apples and pears interwoven with citrus and crushed stone. Easy to drink and easy to like.",Riesling
Germany,"A good value in dry Riesling, this bottling features potent petrol, truffled honey and pineapple notes on the nose, while on the palate it's medium bodied, turning crisp and lean on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"A bit drier in style than Fitz-Ritter's Durkheimer Riesling kabinett, this wine shows hints of peach and dried spices on the nose, then eases into similar flavors tinged with briny minerality on the long finish. It's plump enough to be enjoyable on its own, or with fish or poultry.",Riesling
Germany,Silvaners rarely boast this kind of charm and forward fruit. This one combines apple and citrus notes into a round yet crisp package with overtones of pineapple. This should make a refreshing summer sipper.,Silvaner
Germany,"Light, delicate and dry, this shows Ernie Loosen's Mosel touch. Lime, peach and melon notes add airy nuances over the underlying briny minerality of the Pfalz. Finishes long and slightly peppery-spicy.",Riesling
Germany,"This is a pretty wine, one that manages to balance primary fruit and residual sugar with minerality. Orangey citrus notes, ripe apple and spice notes all mingle easily in this medium-bodied kabinett that's sweetly persistent on the finish. Try as an apéritif, or with lightly spiced Asian cuisine.",Riesling
Germany,"This medium-bodied dry white is prettily aromatic, showing hints of orange blossom, pineapple and pear upfront, then building on the base of fruit with hints of wet stones and a dry, almost chalky finish.",Pinot Blanc
Germany,"A selection from the Würzburger Innere Leiste, this wine offers something of a conundrum: the aromas and flavors are on one hand those of cooked or stewed fruit, while at the same time the wine is light-bodied, silky and vibrant. Worth a try.",Spätburgunder
Germany,"Exceeds even this producer's stunning beerenauslese, featuring an even more intoxicating perfume of honey, dried apricots and candied pineapple, with slightly more acidity to provide balance to the extra level of sweetness, so much so that this wine comes across as refreshing on the finish, despite the incredibly high levels of sugar. Drink now–2050, possibly longer.",Riesling
Germany,"From a vintage not known for its supersweet selections, this wine is a revelation. Honey and bergamot notes mingle easily on the nose, while the palate unfolds to reveal layers of honey, dried apricots and orange marmalade. It's rich, viscous and concentrated without any heaviness, with a finish that's sweet and lingering. This should age through 2040 easily.",Riesling
Germany,"This is a fairly full-bodied Mosel auslese, with plenty of both alcohol (9.5%) and remaining sweetness. A hint of dried apricot marks the nose, while apple, honey and clover blossom also come into play. Finishes long, with mouthcoating intensity of spice and citrus. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",Riesling
Germany,"This medium-bodied Riesling comes across as a bit rich and oily for the kabinett prädikat, but it still offers enjoyable drinking. Hints of dried apricot and orange marmalade shade the aromas, while the flavors are of honeyed stone fruit with some underlying petrol. Finishes clean and minerally.",Riesling
Germany,"Hugely sweet and decadent, this is a tour de force of botrytized winemaking. Honeyed citrus aromas are buoyed by hints of perfume and spice, with dried apricot flavors accented by spiced honey. Mouthcoating, rich and impossibly long, this wine should easily age for 40 or more years.",Riesling
Germany,"Enticingly complex nose, multifaceted, with a medley of blossoms, honey, spice, white peaches and ample minerality showing through. Sweet, with delicious racy acidity and a lively taut texture. This is very focused, with generous flavors of elderberries, stone fruit, orange citrus, spice and slate. Long, persistent finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Schloss Saarstein's auslese is remarkably consistent year to year, testament to the greatness of the site and the quality of the farming and winemaking. The 2008 features cool, slate-driven scents softened just slightly by hints of superripe apples and ripe apricot. This medium-bodied wine is clean and tightly focused, with the sweetness admirably balanced by crisp acids. Should age 15 years or more.",Riesling
Germany,"This succulent, almost tender, wine starts off with lovely aromas of honey and bergamot, adding hints of apricot and vanilla in the mouth. It's a soft, lush style, rather sweet, with a long, mouthwatering finish. It may not be as long-lived as some 2007s, but it should remain delectable for another 10 years or so.",Riesling
Germany,"Realistically priced for genuine German eiswein, this is also rather alcoholic for most, weighing in at 10% abv. So it may not be as sweet as expected, but it still shows razor-like focus, with the residual sweetness balanced by bright pink grapefruit and pineapple notes.",Riesling
Germany,"Shows lovely balance between intense sweetness and crisp acidity, so that the wine's honeyed citrus notes really sing. Hints of marmalade, clove and a perfumed, slightly minty note all add complexity. Delicious now, and probably for a good many years to come.",Riesling
Germany,"“Rotschiefer” means “red slate,” a reference to the soils underlying the vineyard parcel from which this wine is made. The wine itself is thick and rich, with pure scents of fresh-picked apples, and flavors of applesauce and minerals. Lacks the bit of zip that would put it over the top, ratings-wise, but still a very attractive wine for casual sipping. Imported by Magellan Wine Imports.",Riesling
Germany,"Nicely done for an entry-level wine, with lovely fresh notes of green apple, spring flowers and lime on the nose, followed by apple, pear and pineapple flavors. It's light in body, with a soft finish that maintains its focus without being excessively tart. Imported by Billington Imports.",Riesling
Germany,"Part of a growing trend among German wines, the front label omits the vineyard name, but this is from the Westhofener Kirchspiel. Starts off a bit sulfury, but the fruit flavors come through on the palate, delivering lime and apple flavors. Light in body, with a hint of spritz to help keep it fresh on the finish. Imported by Chapin Cellars.",Riesling
Germany,"Smells like ultraripe nectarines or peaches, flesh practically oozing from the skins. In the mouth, it's big, rich and enveloping, yet it finishes with a trace of bitter peach pit. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons.",Riesling
Germany,"Much better than a bottle previously reviewed, this medium-bodied kabinett bears hints of kerosene and slate on the nose, then opens to reveal lime, apple and honey flavors. Good length on the finish, but also a hint of bitterness. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Soft and mouthfilling, with apple, pear, citrus and mineral elements all elegantly intertwined. Finishes with hints of grapefruit and fuel oil. Drink over the next few years. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons.",Riesling
Germany,"Mid gold in color, this wine displays unctuous aromas of honey, ripe apricot, wildflowers and slate. Sweet, but has a lovely raciness on the palate. The plump peach and apricot flavors are layered with hints of anise, slate and honey that come across as very pure and elegant. Taut, focused palate and a long, juicy minerally finish.",Riesling
Germany,"A lush, sweet auslese, the 2008 Jesuitengarten from von Bassermann-Jordan is unctuous in texture and laden with tropical fruit, with just enough citrus for balance. It finishes long and sweet, but clean, inviting one back for another sip. Drink now–2025, possibly longer.",Riesling
Germany,"This wonderful auslese offers volume and richness without weight—it's a sort of fluffy custard in texture, loaded with funky, leesy notes on the nose but also with passion fruit, green apple and pineapple notes on the palate. Yes, it's sweet, but the acids provide beautiful balance on the finish. Drink now–2025.",Riesling
Germany,"Kerner is a variety not often seen in the U.S., although it is among the top five most planted white grapes in Germany. It's a cross between Trollinger (a red grape) and Riesling, making for—in this case—a pretty, aromatic white with hints of muskmelon, tropical fruit, maybe even some red berries, all on a light frame. Long and refreshing on the finish.",Kerner
Germany,"The term “feinherb” is only rarely seen on German wine labels, but it indicates a dry-ish version of whatever prädikat is in question, sort of a halbtrocken. This version is nicely balanced, and yes, on the dry side, with apple and melon aromas and flavors that finish dry and minerally. Imported by Chapin Cellars.",Riesling
Germany,"Plump and round in the mouth yet not fat or heavy, this is what 2003 can deliver when the wines are well made—easy to like, easy to drink Rieslings of great mass appeal. Ripe stone fruit blends with apple and citrus, picking up hints of melon on the finish. Imported by Magellan Wine Imports.",Riesling
Germany,"This light-bodied wine shows impressive balance, it's just not that expressive at this early stage of its evolution. There's some lime and green apple notes, but also lots of beery, yeasty, leesy notes, with the true flavors still unformed. Try in six months. Imported by Loosen Bros. USA.",Riesling
Germany,"Smoky and intense, with peach, melon and floral aromas that burst from the glass. In line with the Charta designation, it's made in a trocken, or dry, style, yet doesn't lack for fruit or flesh. It's fairly rich and full (12% alcohol), yet boasts racy acidity for near-perfect balance.",Riesling
Germany,"A Riesling with an enticing nose of honeysuckle and other summer blossoms, stone fruit and focused stony minerality. There's a wonderfully taut palate, fantastically racy and refreshing, with layers of persistent flavor intensity. The minerality stays with you all the way to a very long lingering finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This auslese is less obviously fruity than many of Loosen's recent efforts, with a smoky, fuel-oil overlay to the honeyed and stone-like flavors. At only 7.5% alcohol, it's sweet yet not heavy, balanced by bright acidity and a hint of prickly CO2 still in evidence. Drink it over the next 15–20 years.",Riesling
Germany,"A departure from the last couple of vintages, with a unique scent of chestnuts adding interest to the sweet, concentrated notes of honey and orange marmalade. It's an odd, different accent, yet the balance of sweetness and bracing acidity is spot on.",Riesling
Germany,"Pale gold in color. The attractive nose features ripe yellow stone fruit with strong mineral overtones, while the palate reveals enough crisp, refreshing acidity to balance the sweetness. There's a smooth, rich texture, showing ample flavors of ripe stone fruit, floral notes and honey. Concentrated, with a moderately long, fresh finish.",Riesling
Germany,"A bit fuller and drier than you might expect from a Mosel Riesling, but there's no questioning this wine's excellent balance. Honey and cinnamon notes accent pear and melon fruit, while hints of petrol lurk in the background. It's almost dry on the long finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This is the flagship vineyard for the large Valckenberg firm, and one of their best wines, year in and year out. The 2003 shows yeasty, leesy, minerally aromas and flavors of pear, pineapple and talc, finishing on tart, grapefruity notes. Light in body; try as an apéritif. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Typical in some ways for 2003, this is a soft, cuddly Riesling that boasts modest pear, apple and melon flavors. Plump and easy to drink over the short term. Imported by Slocum & Sons, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Plump and soft on the midpalate, but tangy on the finish, resulting in a slightly discordant impression. Still, the raw material seems to be in place, with quince and lime-custard aromas and baked apple and pear flavors. Give this another 3–6 months to settle down and it should be fine. Imported by Palm Bay Imports.",Riesling
Germany,"There's a bit of sulfur stink still lurking in the background of this wine, looming over the apple and citrus scents that should emerge more strongly in another six months or so. Lightweight and fresh, with surprising energy and drive. Imported by Slocum & Sons, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Features apple, pear and citrus flavors on a lithe, sweet frame. It would score higher, but for a slight note of grapefruit-pith bitterness on the honey-laden finish. Imported by Loosen Bros. USA.",Riesling
Germany,"Johannes Leitz is rightfully proud of his 2002s. This is his entry-level wine, and it's gorgeous, with a touch of sweetness and slightly rounder acidity than last year's version (which, incidentally, is still going strong). It boasts copious apple, red berry and citrus flavors and a forceful, lingering finish. Sinfully easy to drink.",Riesling
Germany,"Moderately sweet and viscous, without the intense concentration seen in some of the vintage's BAs, this remains a skilfully balanced wine, with candied pineapple, citrus and honey balanced by fresh acidity. Drink it over the next 25 years or so.",Riesling
Germany,"Fairly broad aromas show some evolution with honey notes adding intrigue to ripe stone fruit and floral notes. Medium-sweet, but balanced and taut, with a juicy, crisp texture and lots of minerality on the palate. Persistent layers of flavors with honey, apricot, peach, spice showing nicely. Long minerally finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This is awfully creamy and lush for a kabinett, but yummy at the same time. Some hints of lees and funk add complexity to the sweet green apple, passion fruit and lime flavors. Finishes long, with lingering notes of crushed stone, citrus and honey.",Riesling
Germany,"Boasts classic Mosel Riesling aromas and flavors—lime, pineapple, green apple, maybe a touch of honey—all at an eminently reasonable price. Though richer and creamier than you might expect, the weight is balanced by crisp acidity on the long finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Shows more delicacy than many 2003s, with flowery, green fruit aromas and a light, ethereal mouthfeel. Pear and melon flavors are easy to enjoy now, finishing soft. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"A solid value in dry Riesling (keep in mind that the bottle is one-third larger than standard). The ripe apple scents lead into dry minerally flavors that boast rounded, smooth edges. Purists may gripe that it lacks a certain precision because of this, but others will find it more accessible and easier to drink for precisely the same reason. Imported by Chapin Cellars.",Riesling
Germany,"Abundant apple and peach aromas presage the rush of fleshy fruit that cascades across the palate. There's a hint of unreleased CO2 to help enliven the relatively low-acid mouthfeel, and a bit of lime on the finish to help balance things out further. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts off with some mild sweaty-sock scents that quickly give way to cleaner aromas of pear, apple and lime. Elegantly wrought and balanced, with off-dry apple and citrus flavors that finish on a tart, lime-driven note. Imported by Chapin Cellars.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts off with delicate scents of lime, green apple and talcum powder. Restrained apple flavors make room for minerally notes to shine through in this sweet, but decently balanced, wine. Finishes short. Drink now–2008. Imported by Chapin Cellars.",Riesling
Germany,"Inviting layered aromas of ripe stone fruit, hints of citrus and some earthy spice and minerality. Crisp and refreshing. Very good depth and intensity of lively youthful fruit with a strong mineral core adding complexity. Medium sweet and balanced with a long finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Nicely layered, with inviting fusel notes, ripe yellow fruit and honey aromas. Very minerally. Deliciously crisp, juicy and focused with a nicely taut palate. Lovely rich texture, racy and balanced. Medium sweet, with ample flavor depth—stone fruit, hints of guava, citrus and persistent minerality on a long finish.",Riesling
Germany,"A delicate nose of complex aromas with striking stony minerality goes alongside aromas of honeysuckle, white lilac, elder flower and white peach. Very taut yet filigreed on the palate, this pale, lemon-colored wine is sweet, yet crisp and poised. Ample juicy ripe fruit flavors persist across the palate and lead to a long and layered, refreshing finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Complex, intense nose of fresh honeysuckle, tangerines, marmalade, spice, dried apricots, golden raisins and an earthy minerality abound. Delightfully rich and sweet, but lively and fresh, with nicely balanced racy acidity. Generous concentration of flavor that coats the whole palate and lingers to a sweet but vibrantly juicy finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Citrusy and leaner than most spätlesen in this vintage of unremitting heat, wih candied lime and green apple aromas and flavors, and a prickle of CO2 on the palate. Turns a bit metallic and hard on the finish. Imported by Loosen Bros. USA.",Riesling
Germany,"Fresh and crisp, but it lacks a bit of intensity. An initial blast of sulfur fades readily enough, revealing simple apple and citrus flavors, but that's as far as this usually stellar bottling goes this year. Imported by Loosen Bros. USA.",Riesling
Germany,"This was probably not the best time to be sampling this wine, as it appeared lean and closed at this stage of its evolution. Lime and powdered mineral aromas and flavors finish extremely crisp and unforgiving. Give it another few years to loosen up and this rating may look downright stingy. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"If German wine labels are confusing to Americans, labels like this one are one reason why. Traditionally this wine would be written as Roxheimer Berg, but for some reason this producer has written it Berg Roxheim. Green apple and diesel fuel aromas lead the way, followed by simple, fruity, apple flavors. Sweet and low in acidity, with a finish that's close to cloying. Try this as a dessert sipper with fresh fruit. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"This medium-bodied wine would give many Italian Pinot Grigios a run for their money. Honeyed peaches with a trace of minerality and a dry, clean finish at a reasonable price. Sure, labeling it Grigio is a pure marketing ploy, but the quality is in the bottle. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Pinot Grigio
Germany,"Light, fresh and dry, this is one Riesling that avoids the excess weight present in some of the wines from 2003. Smoke, mineral  and cucumber aromas glide easily into flavors of apple, pear and citrus. Finishes with a lime streak that stands a little apart from the rest of the wine. Imported by Classical Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"A pale, lemon color Riesling. The complex nose of honey, delicate stone fruit, elder-flower and stony minerality is deliciously inviting, while intense, focused ripe fruit prevails all across the palate. This is sweet, yet crisp and oozing freshness, with a taut, lively texture. Very long, complex and subtle at the same time.",Riesling
Germany,"Medium gold in color. Attractive nose, quite citrussy, orange with floral notes and a touch of honey. Layered and reasonably complex. Dry and richly textured on the palate and medium bodied. Nicely taut and well balanced with ample ripe orchard and melon fruit. Evident minerality right across the palate to the finish, which is persistent, layered and savory.",Chardonnay
Germany,"A wine with an inviting nose of ripe fruit, layered with notes of honey and lovely, savory-earthy minerality. This is broad across the palate, with a smooth rich texture. Dry and fresh, featuring ample flavors of ripe orchard and stone fruit, with spice and balsamic notes adding complexity. Long length and a persistent savory finish.",Weissburgunder
Germany,"Pale lemony color. Some initial reductive notes blow off to reveal a classic Mosel nose of delicate flowers, white stone fruit and slate. Crisp, elegant, juicy and packed with mouthwatering stone fruit and citrus flavors. Very minerally, taut and focused, with tremendous length and a persistent, juicy finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Lemon in color, with pronounced floral aromas—elder-flower, honeysuckle and acacia—alongside white peaches and nectarines. There's a strong mineral focus on the nose. Sweet, yet deliciously crisp and juicy, with ample flavor concentration. Taut and lively, and has a long minerally finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Sweet and lightweight, with typical floral, green apple and peach aromas and flavors. Lime flavors kick in on the finish, which seem a bit insubstantial and lacking depth. A superficial charmer that's easy to drink over the next few years—just don't expect a long-term relationship. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts with some lime and grapefruity notes, but seems to get softer as it moves toward the finish, ending with ripe flavors of apples, pears and even some stone fruit. Light in body, a tough trick in this sunbaked vintage. Imported by Loosen Bros. USA.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts with ripe apple and white peach scents that gravitate toward green apple and vanilla flavors on the palate. Medium- to full-bodied, with a mildly spicy-peppery finish. Imported by Classical Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine boasts a lovely nose redolent of dried apricots and bergamot, with fresh, mossy hints on the background. On the palate, it's medium bodied, not overly sweet or concentrated but with clean melon and citrus flavors that finish clean and fresh.",Riesling
Germany,"From young vines, this is a sweet, slightly simple, but nicely balanced wine, displaying plenty of ripe apple and citrus flavors. The lingering, honeyed sweetness is balanced on the finish by just a trace of astringency. Drink now-2020.",Riesling
Germany,"Mid-gold in color. Quite a broad bouquet - ripe stone fruit honey, white flowers and a strong stony mineral focus. Sweet, smooth, rich texture yet crisp, refreshing and brimming with lively flavors. Very long, persistent with complex layers that linger on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Inviting nose of intense mellow, yellow fruit with notably focused minerality, some spice and a hint of flowers. Off dry and beautifully balanced by the crisp acidity and generous flavors of delicious, juicy fruit, this is richly textured, yet taut and elegant. Long, persistent, layered finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Delicate lemony color. Fragrant nose of peach and apricot crème pastry, with hints of sherbet and grapefruit and a stony mineral focus. Crisp, racy with a youthful fruit cocktail medley of flavors. Light-bodied but focused and taut. Not hugely concentrated, but well balanced and persistent.",Riesling
Germany,"Subdued on the nose, where the sulfur is still very much in evidence. Pear and lemon fruit on the palate, gliding into a finish that seems a bit hard, with acids that jut out, interrupting the smooth flow of the wine. Imported by Slocum & Sons, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Disappointing. Has some nice lime and mineral scents and flavors, but finishes very tart and citrusy, without the expected depth. Imported by Classical Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"Rich and thickly textured, showing impressive concentration but also a heavy, plodding feel. Pear and apple flavors struggle alongside hints of unripe melon and quince. Unclear how this one will evolve, hence the conservative rating. Imported by Classical Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"An odd wine, with some favorable elements, but also a strange sourness on the nose and a mouthfeel that's a bit syrupy and sweet. In between, there are appealing dusty-minerally notes, and pineapple and pear flavors. Imported by Chapin Cellars.",Riesling
Germany,"Lean and a bit ungenerous, especially for a 2003. Tart apple and citrus aromas and flavors shed some early sulfur but never really blossom, finishing hard. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Mid-gold in color, featuring broad, layered aromas of ripe yellow stone fruit, ruby red grapefruit and mineral notes. Concentrated flavors prevail across the palate showing crisp citrus fruits, nectarines, white peaches and hints of honey. Racy acidity balances the sweetness, as does its firm, taut texture, which gives the wine focus.",Riesling
Germany,"Light and very crisp, with modest apple and citrus flavors. A whiff of sulfur on the nose distracts a bit, but the overall emphasis is on zesty limes. Imported by Slocum & Sons, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Not a lot of depth or length, but what's here is pretty enough, blending peach and pear nectar. Full and soft; easy to drink. Imported by Palm Bay Imports.",Riesling
Germany,"Dark in color for an eiswein, with intense, caramelized sugar, golden-raisin and dried-spice aromas. Tastes intensely sweet and sour, with sky-high acids and sugars that can't quite keep up. And it finishes with tart, quince-like notes. Imported by Palm Bay Imports.",Riesling
Germany,"Very floral and lilac-like—almost a little artificial-flower smelling. Lightweight and on the lean side, with apple and lime flavors that finish tart and clean. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,This bargain-priced white is a blend of two-thirds Riesling and one-third Pinot Blanc. The result is a somewhat simple but clean and tasty wine that mixes apple and pear with citrus. Feels biggish in the mouth but without a lot of depth. Good party option. Imported by Billington Imports.,White Blend
Germany,"Slight hint of sulfur at first, but it blows off and the nose opens to reveal a rich medley of ripe orchard fruit tinged with dried tarragon and savory spice. Crisp, bright and laden with a patchwork of flavors: ripe apples, pears and stone fruit against a backdrop of earthy minerality. Broad yet only medium bodied, with a moderately long finish.",Chardonnay Weissburgunder
Germany,"As with all of the Dr. Loosen wines, this blended kabinett is very fruit-forward and direct. The green apple and lime notes are wonderfully pure and balanced. Drink this light, spritely wine over the next few years.",Riesling
Germany,"Round and plush, this relatively high-alcohol (13%) Mosel Riesling offers plenty of ripe fruit flavors, yet finishes dry. A smoky, leesy character on the nose wraps easily around a core of pineapple and peach fruit. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"The peach and pineapple scents seem almost candied—or maybe crystalline is a better descriptor—hard yet fragile. Melon and spice at the core are pleasant enough, but the wine seems to lack a bit of depth and length. Imported by Loosen Bros. USA.",Riesling
Germany,"A pleasant, lightweight Riesling, but one without a lot of intensity. Modest pear, melon and apple flavors finish soft and easy. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Classic Mosel nose of fresh blossoms, delicate stone fruit, slate and hints of flint. This is medium sweet, crisp and lively with lots of juicy fruit flavors, notes of acacia honey, white peach and citrus. Nicely taut and focused palate, very minerally with refreshing long finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Mid-gold color. Pronounced aromas of ripe yellow fruits, honey, with hints of warm earth, savory fresh root vegetables and spice. Sweet, richly textured, but refreshingly crisp. Vibrant flavors follow through on the palate showing strong mineral notes. Broad but firm palate and a long lingering lively finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Mid-gold in color, with attractive aromas of ripe stone fruits. Focused by earthy minerality, this is dry and crisp, with abundant fruit in the mouth: peach, apricot, orange peel and spice. Nicely balanced, with a long, minerally finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Sweet, verging on honeyed, this lush wine features plenty of superripe apples balanced by just a dash of citrus and a hint of bitterness on the finish. Could use more complexity.",Riesling
Germany,"Notes of honey and cinnamon combine with a slightly musky spice note to give this sweet auslese added interest. It's round in the mouth without being soft or flabby in the slightest, with lingering notes of baked apple on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Pale gold color wine, with attractive floral nose hints, honey, slate and some obvious sulfur. Racy with a crisp juicy texture, lemony and moderately taut. Sweet with ample citrus and white peach flavors on the palate. Evident minerality on the finish adds complexity. Reasonably long length.",Riesling
Germany,"Pale gold color. Broad and aromatic, showing ripe yellow peach and nectarine, hints of honey, dried herbs and an earthy minerality. Fuller body and weightier on the palate than expected. Slightly loose knit but shows ample ripe stone-fruit flavors that balance sweetness and acidity slightly awkwardly on the palate.",Riesling
Germany,"Slightly closed at first, but slowly opens to reveal ripe stone fruits, hints of white flowers and an earthy minerality. Dry, with racy acidity that is balanced by lots of lively stone-fruit and citrus flavors. Palate is nicely taut and elegant. Moderately long, juicy finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Fragrant and slightly floral or herbal, but there's also an intriguing mineral-smoke note that adds dimension to the aromas. It's light to medium-bodied, with apple, mint and lime flavors complementing a dry, stony minerality. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"It's roughly two-thirds Chardonnay, one-third Pinot Blanc, made in a dry style. Smells like vanilla and pears, but there's also a persistent vinegary note that creeps in and doesn't fade. Tasters less sensitive to this character will no doubt find more to like. Imported by Magellan Wine Imports.",White Blend
Germany,"Quite ripe and precise stone fruit aromas with interesting hints of minerality. Refreshingly crisp with balanced sweetness. Ample youthful, juicy fruits dance across the palate. Moderate intensity of flavor, zesty texture and a moderately long finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Prevailing lemony, citrus-cocktail aromas with hints of almond macaroons. Though medium sweet, it is lip-smackingly crisp and racy, with zesty citrus flavors following through on the palate. Moderately intense and reasonably taut, if a little austere.",Riesling
Germany,"The restrained nose shows some white peach notes, lees and stony minerality. This is complex, layered and persistent across the palate, opening up to ample stone fruit flavors, earthy notes, dried herbs and spice. Crisp, with sweetness, moderately concentrated flavors and a rich texture all in balance, if a little loose knit on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This boasts a pretty nose of peach, honeysuckle blossom, tangerine and cantaloupe and stony minerality. Lively, juicy texture with a medley of zesty citrus fruit, and fresh stone-fruit flavors. Hints of honey and blossoms and a lingering minerality linger on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Pale gold color, this has a rather reduced nose at first that slowly gives way to ripe stone fruit aromas and an earthy, savory note. Not very complex, but displays vibrant citrus and stone-fruit flavors that impart a pleasant tingle to the midpalate. Fairly light-bodied and easy drinking, with a moderate fruity finish.",Riesling
Germany,"An intriguing wine, this offers honeyed, apricot-like aromas and a broad, mouthfilling texture. The flavors of stone fruit and corn oil are mouthcoating but not particularly fresh, lacking a bit of verve, yet still finishing dry and persistent.",Riesling
Germany,"Smoky and leesy upfront, with powerful diesel notes. Yet all that seems to disappear on the palate, where apple and citrus flavors hold sway. Has a pleasantly plump, custardy texture and a crisp clean finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Relatively full-bodied, even though the alcohol is only 10%, this shows a touch of the botrytis influence of the vintage, with apricot notes adding interest to the straightforward melon and herb flavors. Finishes soft; drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Hochgewächs suggests an extra level of quality, and this is good, especially for one from the oft-maligned Zeller Schwarze Katz. Starts off a bit leesy on the nose, but offers pleasant flavors of white peaches, melon and spice before coming to a slightly attenuated close.",Riesling
Germany,"Pungently grassy and grapefruity on the nose, with strange apple and pink grapefruit flavors on the soft, sweet palate. A rare misstep from Ernie Loosen? Imported by Loosen Bros. USA.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine features an unflattering dichotomy: soft, stewy fruit on one hand, and a hard, slightly metallic finish on the other. Passable, but lacks harmony. Imported by Loosen Bros. USA.",Riesling
Germany,"Smells and tastes like scorched creamed corn laced with honey and marmalade. Sweet but not very harmonious. Imported by Broadbent Selections, Inc.",Silvaner
Germany,"Earthy on the nose, with savory aromas, fern fronds and ultraripe yellow fruit. This is dry and racy—almost a little tart—showing moderately intense flavors of ripe melons, Golden Delicious apples and Bosc pears. A little skeletal for the crispness but juicy and refreshing, with a long and savory earthy finish.",Pinot Blanc
Germany,"On the drier side for an auslese, with the alcohol reaching 10%, this wine features hints of apricot and pineapple marmalade, but there are also less pristine earthy, fungal notes that some may read as complex while others may find them slightly dirty. Crisp and linear on the finish. Drink now–2015.",Riesling
Germany,"Pale to mid-gold in color with a heady nose of exotic spice, rose water and floral blossoms with a hint of smoke. Round and warming on the palate. Sweet yet fresh and juicy with moderate intensity of citrus and stone fruit flavors. Some savory earthy notes on a moderately long finish.",Gewürztraminer
Germany,"Pale lemony color. Classic Mosel nose of stone, slate, white peach and flower blossoms. Vibrant and crisp, balancing the sweetness on the palate and resulting in a wine with a juicy texture and moderate intensity, turning racy on the finish. Not overly complex, but refined.",Riesling
Germany,"Mid-gold in color, this has a pronounced classic Gewürztraminer nose of lychee, rose petals, spice and ripe stone fruit with notes of earthy minerality. Sweet and richly textured, round mouthfeel with moderately intense flavors similar to nose with an added note of stem ginger and smoky spice on the finish.",Gewürztraminer
Germany,"Shows wonderful purity of fruit—green apple and lime, perhaps a touch of flower shop greens—and impreccable balance, being light in body, off dry, crisp and refreshing. Delicious.",Riesling
Germany,"There's an appealing nose of ripe yellow stone fruit, spice and an earthy minerality. Medium-sweet with a lovely rich texture, fleshy, but well balanced by the refreshing acidity. Smooth and broad across the palate, showing strong flavor intensity that lingers. Long, with a persistent layered, minerally finish.",Gewürztraminer
Germany,"Smoky, intense and petrolly on the nose, this medium-bodied Riesling goes 180 degrees on the palate, where the flavors are the more typical apple and lemon-lime. It's a touch oily, finishing with a tangy, citrusy edge.",Riesling
Germany,"The subtle nose features a medley of citrus fruits. Zesty lemon, grapefruit and tangerine flavors persist across the palate. Juicy and refreshing with an attractive midpalate creaminess adding weight and complexity. Smooth and long, with a nice mineral kick on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Pale gold in color, with a fairly pronounced nose of orange citrus rind, dried herbs, pear drops and lime sherbet. Medium sweet and fruity, not terribly complex but nicely juicy and well balanced with an attractive spicy kick on the finish. Youthful, refreshing and easy-drinking.",Gewürztraminer
Germany,"Full and soft for a Riesling, with appealing aromas of corn oil, ripe apples, pears and limes and flavors of minerals and spice. Attractive, but lacks a bit of vibrancy and zest on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Aromas of pure, sweet, dry botrytis follow through to a wine of great richness, sweetness and acidity on the palate. Offers orange marmalade flavors and concentrated superripe fruit; at this stage, it is just beginning to come together—give it 10 years or more. Imported by Michael Skurnik Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"Ripe nose of peach, apricot and honey with some petrol. This is sweet yet refreshing, with moderately concentrated ripe flavors. Smooth texture across the palate, attractive mineral notes and some spice on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"The appealing nose of lemony-lime aromas features a hint of honey. This medium-sweet wine with a gripping crispness is fairly light-bodied and slightly loose-knit, but refreshing, with moderately intense flavors of citrus cocktail. A nice earthy kick chimes in on the finish.",Scheurebe
Germany,"The Toreye is the ancient name of the Eymann family and is used to designate the top wines from this third-generation family estate. As so often with eiswein, this wine distills the essence of Riesling into a few drops of sweetness, honey and piercing acidity. Will develop over many years. A beautiful wine. Imported by Pivotal Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Not a stereotypical fruity Riesling, the 2009 Qvinterra features plenty of savory, umami-like notes of broth and brine to go along with hints of sun-warmed peaches. It's medium bodied, with a long, velvety-textured finish unusual for a white wine. Intriguing.",Riesling
Germany,"Medium-gold in color, with a pronounced nose of ripe yellow peach and nectarine and hints of spice and minerality. Crisp, with juicy, sweet, ultraripe yellow fruit flavors following on the palate, but quite loose-knit texture. Simple easy-drinking.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts off with an almost indescribable note of petrichor, then develops more apple, citrus and even a hint of peachy ripeness. It's plump and medium in body, with lovely balance to the off-dry finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine starts off a bit funky and earthy on the nose, but opens up to reveal more floral and lime-like scents. At 13% alcohol, it's medium bodied and impressively dry tasting, with lime blossom and pineapple fruit balanced by crisp acids. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Light nose, not showing much intensity on this pale gold Riesling. Slightly resinous, showing more on the palate with ripe stone-fruit flavors, hints of melon and pineapple. Quite sweet and rich, with slightly syrupy texture. Pleasing but straightforward and simple.",Riesling
Germany,"Pale gold in color. The savory, earthy nose shows dried herbs and a hint of honey. This is off-dry, but very well balanced by crisp acidity, leaving it refreshing across the palate. Moderately intense juicy citrus, cantaloupe and nectarine flavors. A little loose knit and simple on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Medium-bodied and round in the mouth, this is readily approachable Riesling with slightly smoky aromas of diesel fuel and corn oil. Orange zest and spice flavors flesh out the package, finishing a bit soft.",Riesling
Germany,"Soft and round in the mouth, this is rather alcoholic for a Mosel (12%), but carries it well, balancing the weight with flinty, citrusy aromas and flavors that fall off rapidly on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"A fresh, ripe wine that tastes rich enough to be a beerenauslese. It is packed with honey flavors, baked apples, mulberries and light acidity. At 7.5% alcohol, you can give into the temptation to drink a second glass. Imported by Michael Skurnik Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"A single-vineyard wine packed with flavors of sweet currants, apricots and nuts. Offers fresh acidity,  minerally accents and great elegance. It is still so youthful, and with its richness it is likely to age for at least 10 years. Imported by Michael Skurnik Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"Broad aromas of ripe yellow fruit and a hint of flint on the palate. Sweet and moderately rich in texture, but slightly loose knit and simple, with attractively ripe and juicy stone-fruit flavors and a touch of minerality shining through on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Fresh-smelling, like citrus and green herbs or grass, this medium-bodied Riesling is not very fruity, displaying a more sandstone-mineral character on the palate. There's a vaguely umami aspect to it as well, as it ends on a mouthwatering beefy or briny note. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Fruity, packed with berry and melon aromas and flavors that end up coming across as slightly confected, with a slightly syrupy texture in the mouth.",Riesling
Germany,"Ripe aromas of fig, marmalade and honey, with hints of resin and balsamic. This is sweet and richly textured, but slightly heavy and low in acid. Moderately high flavor intensity showing similar flavors as on the nose. Fairly long, but shows a touch bitterness on the finish.",Gewürztraminer
Germany,"An attractive nose of wild strawberries, red currants and cranberries is followed by a dry, nicely round feeling on the palate, with a medley of ripe wild forest fruit and a savory earthy note. This medium-bodied wine displays ample flavor intensity and a smooth, moderately long finish.",Rosé
Germany,"Plump and sweet, this is a bit soft and lacking structure, although the ripe apple and pear flavors do offer plenty of immediate attraction. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"A bit leaner in style than the 2005—as you might expect—with attractive aromas of pineapple and fresh greens giving way to flavors of honey, spice and melon. The fruit drops away on the finish, leaving tart acids to linger.",Riesling
Germany,"Understated on the nose, but there are some pretty hints of melon, spice and crushed stone. Light in body, with modest fruit flavors on the palate, but some finishing anise and clove.",Riesling
Germany,"As expected, this vintage is not as interesting as the 2005, but it still remains a decent Riesling. It's fresh and minerally, with lime zest and pineapple flavors that finish tart and refreshing.",Riesling
Germany,"Simple but fresh and appealing, this offering—made in conjunction with Washington State's Chateau Ste. Michelle—is a light, entry-level Ries ling filled with green apple and citrus flavors. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Light and fresh, with citrusy flavors dressed up by flowershop greens and a touch of dusty chalk. Finishes with a hint of ripe apple.",Riesling

Germany,"Starts off well, featuring scents of green apples and honey. But the flavors are simple and it's a bit on the weighty side, with ample (12%) alcohol and some residual sugar as well.",Riesling
Germany,"Fairly intense aromas of jammy black and red fruit: plums, blackberries and cassis, with notes of coffee and vanilla. On the palate, this is warm, with lots of sweet baking spices and baked black fruit. Fairly simple with a slightly syrupy texture and a warm, spicy finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Germany,"Mid-gold in color, with a richly honeyed nose, slightly caramel like, showing ultraripe yellow fruits, spice and earthy tuber notes. Earthiness and sweet ripeness follow through on the palate, but it tastes quite fresh. Loose knit, but simple and easy drinking. Finishes slightly short with a resinous kick.",Riesling
Germany,"Part of Dr. Loosen's stable, this is a reasonably dry Riesling at a reasonable price. Petrichor and grapefruit lead the way, with hints of riper citrus fruits helping to round out the midpalate. Ends on notes of anise, crushed stone and citrus.",Riesling

Germany,"A blend of Weissburgunder and Sylvaner, this accessibly priced Icewine features aromas of honey, caramel and citrus, with flavors of honey, tea and citrus that are sweet and enjoyable without being profound. Overall, it's soft and sweet; fine as an affordable by-the-glass offering.",White Blend
Germany,"This sweet spätlese displays some rather funky, sweaty aromas, but also ample apple and citrus fruit, and the resulting combination is both likable and complex. The crisp, green-apple finish fades a bit quickly, but this is a pleasant warm-weather sipper.",Riesling
Germany,"Pale lemon in color. Restrained at first and quite reduced, but opens up in the glass to show appealing citrus and white peach aromas. Crisp and juicy, with citrus flavors predominating—tangerine, ruby red grapefruit and meyer lemon. Medium sweet, refreshing but slightly short on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"To judge by its nose, this medium-bodied Riesling is quiet and introverted. And the flavors are also relatively neutral, with a slight earthiness and savory character defining its profile. Has the same lingering beefy-brininess on the finish as the other Liebfruenstift wines, just not as intense.",Riesling
Germany,"Quite subdued on the nose, with delicate notes of mixed wild berries and a savory earthiness. Light-bodied and refreshing, with soft tannins and moderate intensity of red berries: cranberries, loganberries and wild strawberries. Fairly simple, but an honest, pale ruby-colored  wine.",Pinot Noir
Germany,"A bit lighter in body and fruitier in style than the very similar 2009 Kirchenschlüssel, this dry Riesling displays crisp apple and citrus flavors alongside deeper, earthier, more savory notes.",Riesling
Germany,"Candied nose of sweet red currants, cherries and savory herbs. On the palate, this is quite warm, with mild cherry compote, forest floor and earthy flavors. Simple and a little dilute, but easy drinking, with a pleasantly fruity finish.",Rosé
Germany,"Mid-gold in color. Earthy, heady, herbal nose with notes of tangy lime marmalade. Sweet, with a creamy, smooth texture. Tangy citrus flavors follow through with hints of resinous herbs. Pleasant and easy-drinking but with only moderate length and an earthy finish",Gewürztraminer
Germany,"Offers plenty of citrus, spanning the spectrum from lime to orange and tangerine, with just a hint of nectarine mixed in. At 8.5% alcohol, this kabinett gives an impression close to dryness, and despite despite relatively soft acids on the finish, it's nicely balanced.",Riesling
Germany,"Pale gold in color. Slightly sweet and candied aromas prevail: pear drops and white flowers. Similar flavors appear on the fairly light-bodied palate. This is fresh, fruity and easy to drink, but lacking any great depth or flavor intensity. A slight bitter note is noticeable on the finish.",Pinot Gris
Germany,"Pale ruby core with slight garnet rim. Moderately intense earthy aromas, leather, dried cherries and a hint of caramel  draw you in, while the palate is medium-bodied, with a rustic grip to the tannins. Fairly warm and chunky in texture, with flavors of ripe baked red fruits. Crisp acidity helps keep the balance. Slightly hot on the finish.",Pinot Noir
Germany,"Sweet, rich and soft, this is a nice wine, but in the context of site, producer and vintage, a bit of a disappointment. Honey and clove flavors lack extra dimensions of complexity and focus, finishing without the expected balancing zing of acidity.",Riesling
Germany,"There's a simple nose of tangy orange marmalade on this medium-gold colored wine. Similar flavors follow through on the palate with zingy lime-sherbet notes. Sweet but racy enough to compensate. Still, this is a bit one dimensional and lacking depth of flavor. Pleasant and easy-drinking, with moderate length.",Gewürztraminer
Germany,"An odd bird, this wine is almost pungent, with intense, earthy aromas that carry a nutty edge. It's hugely thick and viscous (and sweet), but the candied orange flavors lack a bit of balancing acidity.",Riesling
Germany,"Light in body despite 12.5% alcohol, this lithe, sinewy Riesling is almost dry in style, with zippy pineapple and citrus fruit tracing a lean path down the palate. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Textbook fruchtig Riesling—but with the volume turned up to 11. The flavors of honeyed apple, nectarine and lime are sweet and the wine round and plump in the mouth, but then electric acids kick in, providing great balance through the long finish. Exciting to try now, but this wine should age 10-plus years without any trouble at all.",Riesling
Germany,"This spätlese from the huge Moselland cooperative does a decent job at balancing hints of softly ripe peaches with taut grapefruity elements, all reinforced by a rather sinewy palate feel. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"This soft yet mouthwatering Riesling is plump and medium bodied, with apple, citrus and melon notes finishing clean and correct. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Very earthy aromas of root tubers, roast meat and a hint of strawberry gumdrop. This is medium-bodied, with grippy tannins, and comes across as slightly awkward and warm on the palate, with flavors of jammy red fruit. Fairly simple, with a relatively short warm finish.",Spätburgunder
Germany,"A soft, easy style that should have broad appeal, this modest spätlese marries slightly confected, ripe fruit flavors with more balanced citrusy notes. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"If this wine's aromas don't exactly burst from the glass, that's OK, because the modest citrus notes are clean and fresh, balancing a bit of sweetness against crisp acids. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine is atypically fine and chiseled for this estate, combining bright, sweet fruity notes of lime and green apples with crushed stone and spring flowers. It's light in body, but impeccably balanced.",Riesling
Germany,"The Blue Fish Rieslings are decent efforts from the Niederkirchen cooperative. The 2009 Sweet Riesling features ripe pear and melon balanced by crisp pineapple notes. It's rather soft and sweet, but since that's what it's supposed to be, it's hard to quibble, especially at the price.",Riesling
Germany,"Uncharacteristically earthy and spicy for a Mosel wine, with flavors of loam accented by musky spice notes. It's off dry in style yet relatively broad on the palate, again setting itself apart from the mainstream.",Riesling
Germany,"Light almost to the point of inconsequence, this floral, citrusy Riesling is off dry in style, with modest apple and citrus flavors. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Smells of baby powder, green apple and lime make for a promising start, but this wine turns sweet and a bit flabby on the palate, as the bubble gum and cotton candy flavors are only partially balanced by modest acidity.",Riesling
Germany,"Pale lemon color. There's a slightly resinous nose with strong earthy overtones and hints of citrus. Racy, almost tart and a bit jagged across the palate. Moderate flavor intensity of lemon and grapefruit sherbet. Lacks some flesh, and finishes a touch short.",Riesling
Germany,"From one of Germany's biggest cooperative wineries, this is a pleasant, if somewhat modestly concentrated Riesling. Apple and citrus flavors don't show a ton of complexity, but they're clean and varietally correct, with the sugar balanced by adequate acids. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"A medium-bodied, slightly chunky Riesling, this lacks the elegance and finesse of the best Mosel wines, but still manages a tasty balance of sweet and tart, with apple, citrus and earthy notes all combining on the palate.",Riesling
Germany,"Sweet, lush and harmonious, with almost decadent honey, apple and citrus flavors balanced by scents of crushed stone and just enough acidity to keep things vibrant.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts off with promising aromas of struck flint, lime and passion fruit, then delivers flavors that are sweet and succulent. The ripe tropical fruit notes seem to lack the intense acids of some 2010 wines, making this a lush, easygoing wine to drink over the next few years.",Riesling
Germany,"The “black cat” Riesling I remember from my childhood rides again, with modest green apple notes accented by bits of earth and citrus. It's off dry and soft, yet with a slightly sour edge to the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Thirty bucks may seem like a lot for an entry-level Riesling, but this is an exemplary example. Aromas of wet stones, moss and spring flowers are mouthwatering, and then are followed by a complex array of nonfruity flavors, like stones and greens carried along by a mouthfeel that's light as a feather. Tart pineapple emerges on the long finish. Drink anytime over the next 10 years.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine's calling card is its electric acidity, which provides a poignant counterbalance to the wine's plump feel on the palate. Ripe citrus notes of pineapple and orange offer plenty of flavor to go along with the superb length. It's ready to drink, yet should prove capable of aging at least 5–6 years.",Riesling
Germany,"Ripe and peachy in style, with accents of brine, honey and cinnamon. It's round and voluptuous in the mouth, then gains focus and crispness on the finish, finishing without an excess of sugar. Try it anytime over the next 6–8 years.",Riesling
Germany,"Sweet and broad, this eiswein displays a distinctly sour edge to its flavors, which proved offputting to this taster.",Gewürztraminer
Germany,"Perhaps because of its slow, natural fermentation in large casks and the resulting lees contact, this wine shows a bit of toasty, mealy character and a slightly creamy texture. It's a weighty Riesling (for the Mosel, anyway), with ripe notes of peach complementing citrus fruit and a dry, stony finish.",Riesling
Germany,"There's a brooding quality to the smoky, diesel-fuel like aromas of this wine, but that's left in the rearview by ripe flavors of honey and baked apple once it's in the mouth. This wine is round and atypically soft for the vintage, but picks up some lively lime notes on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts off with wet stone and lime aromas, then folds in Granny Smith flavors on the palate, giving it just the right mix of mineral, citrus and apple. It's lightweight but potent, with a lean but wiry frame. Drink now–2018.",Riesling
Germany,"The entry-level Riesling from this historic estate is a solid, satisfying wine in 2010, offering modest aromas and flavors of citrus fruit and wet stones. It's a medium-weight, almost-dry wine, with a long, crisp finish. Drink now–2017.",Riesling
Germany,"“Feinherb” isn't an officially defined term, but it's generally understood to mean a wine that's slightly drier than might be expected without being fully dry. This is a medium-bodied, slightly sweet wine, with notes of honey and paraffin alongside citrus fruit. Drink it over the next year or two.",Riesling
Germany,"A nicely balanced entry-level Riesling, with hints of stone fruit and wet stone accenting apple and citrus. As a Saar wine should be, it's properly light on its feet, with refreshing acids on the abbreviated finish. Drink now and over the next few years.",Riesling
Germany,"A wine that shows it is possible to make a good Riesling at a reasonable price, the 2010 from Clean Slate offers up basic apple and citrus flavors. Hints of crushed stone and spring flowers elevate it above the ordinary, as does the mouthwatering finish of this off-dry wine. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Riesling's growing popularity has led to a number of recent brand introductions, like this one. It's light in body, with a wiry intensity to its acids and crisp green apple, lime and wet stone notes. Drink it over the next year.",Riesling
Germany,"It's a bit chunky for a Mosel Riesling, but this wine also offers enough in the way of semisweet lime and pineapple flavors to compensate. There's a hint of struck flint on the nose and a slightly custardy texture. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Musky, spicy and reasonably complex on the nose, this recent entrant into the ranks of realistically priced Riesling is a bit chunky in the mouth, but offers satisfying apple, melon and citrus flavors.",Riesling
Germany,"A respectable effort, Raimund Prüm's 2009 Essence displays fine aromas of honey, citrus and clove blossom. The melon and citrus flavors lack a bit of intensity, yet still finish clean and refreshing. Drink this lightweight wine over the next six months or so.",Riesling
Germany,"The little-known Mosel village of Reil is the source of this perplexing wine. It possesses attractive and slightly stony, citrus aromas, and starts off on the sweet side, with bright pineapple fruit. But somewhere on the palate it shifts gears, turning dry and tart almost to the point of being sour.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts off with aromas of struck flint, heating oil and even some sweaty-sock notes before delivering melon and apple flavors on the palate. Offers decent complexity, but lacks focus and length. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Even in a flight of top BAs and TBAs, this one stood out. It's hugely sweet and viscous, yet also has amazingly fresh acids that really prolong the finish and promise decades—if not centuries—of cellaring. Golden raisin and dried apricot notes are true to type, and the wine's balance is impeccable.",Riesling
Germany,"Hugely sweet yet reasonably balanced given its enormous concentration, this is a tremendous example of the quality heights sweet Riesling can achieve. Golden raisin, dried apricots and candied pineapple all swirl together in a delicious haze of sugar-coma-inducing syrup that nevertheless goes down easily. Will age easily for decades.",Riesling
Germany,"This eiswein is supersweet, yet remains decently balanced, thanks to a laser beam of bright acidity. After an initial hint of volatility, the flavors of preserved citrus and stone fruits are almost painful in their intensity, so sip it in small doses and savor the nearly endless finish.",Riesling
Germany,"A wonderfully drinkable beerenauslese, which makes it a serious accomplishment—sometimes these wines can just be too much. This one balances its intense dried apricot and golden raisin notes with tropical and citrus fruit and lively acidity.",Riesling
Germany,"Von Schubert bottled two eisweins from the Herrenberg in 2009. This one is pale in color, with intense pineapple and honey flavors. The wine is sweet, luscious and viscous yet never cloying, with a long finish that features unfolding layers of fruit flavor.",Riesling
Germany,"This lesser-known vineyard is the source of at least two stupendous eisweins in 2009. This one features demerara syrup and ripe peaches imbued with an incredibly lush texture, yet balanced by bright acids and a slightly briny quality on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"The scents of dried apricot and honey are made even more captivating by intriguing hints of musky spice. This is viscous, luscious and complex, with bergamot notes that lend another exotic element. Long and mouthwatering on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"One of the palest icewines to come across our tasting table, this is an extraordinarily fine example, with great purity of fruit and incredible balance. Tangerine and pineapple flavors shine with pristine clarity from start to finish, making it very drinkable.",Riesling
Germany,"Sweet and viscous, this ratchets up the level of sugar and concentration beyond that of Weil's 2009 auslesen. Dried apricots rule, but nuances of musky spice and candied pineapple play supporting roles. Unctuous enough to pair with dessert if need be, but better on its own, or perhaps with aged hard cheeses.",Riesling
Germany,"Terrific, from its nearly indefinable aromas akin to Cloud Ear fungus to its intensely sweet yet racy palate. Dried apricot, peach and pineapple flavors give it substance without excessive weight, finishing long and intense. Drink now–2030.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts off a bit sweaty, then develops passion fruit and tangerine aromas. It's a medium-bodied auslese, sweet but balanced, with peach and apricot, ripe citrus and honey all coming together in lovely harmony. Delicious now, and should age well for 10–20 years.",Riesling
Germany,"So unctuous and decadently sweet that this is one of those TBAs that's best taken in very small sips. Dried apricot, candied pear and caramelized pineapple flavors are concentrated and intense, lingering sweetly on the long finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This historic estate certainly excelled with sweet wines in 2009. This auslese is lusciously sweet yet lithe, its ripe stone fruit—apricot and peach—balanced by citrusy notes. Finishes long and clean, not cloying. Delicious now, but should easily be capable of aging for 20–30 years.",Riesling
Germany,"Perhaps a step behind Weil's other supersweet 2009s, this eiswein remains a prodigious effort. The candied pineapple and golden raisin notes are so intense, so concentrated that they're almost painful to taste, lingering virtually forever on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Like all of the Schloss's noble sweet wines, this one isn't overblown, displaying ample sweetness but also zesty acidity. There's a slight greenish hint to the candied citrus and dried pineapple flavors, with a lemony streak on the finish that balances the sweetness impeccably. Should last for 40–50 years—possibly more—in a cool cellar.",Riesling
Germany,"A terrific auslese, sweet but balanced near perfectly by lime-like acids. It's stony yet honeyed, concentrated yet somehow light on its feet. Then it's bright, fresh and full of juicy citrus fruit on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Loosen's '09 auslese from the Sonnenuhr unleashes a cavalcade of ripe tropical fruit, ranging from pineapple and guava to carambola and lime. It's very sweet and isn't showing much more than fruit at this point in time, but it should develop additional complexity with cellaring.",Riesling
Germany,"The wine's floral aromas and somewhat restrained fruit on the nose strike a refined tone, while on the palate the wine is lush, round and sweet, buoyed by bright pineapple, peach and lime flavors. Finishes long and sleekly elegant.",Riesling
Germany,"This TBA features almost endless variations on the sugary theme: caramelized sugar, demarara syrup and honey all swirl together, wrapped around a bit of citrusy acidity. A distinctly musky spice note adds interest. Drink now–2040.",Riesling
Germany,"Lush and decadent, with intensely sweet notes of demarara syrup, peach and citrus, yet there's enough acidity to bring you back for another sip, and another. The sugar clings to the palate for a long time on the finish. Drink now–2030.",Riesling
Germany,"Dark, almost russet in color, this is an eiswein that's definitely out of the ordinary, with notes of fusty library, walnut, dried apricots and figs that come across as a bit syrupy in texture. It seems a bit advanced compared to other eisweins, but it will likely remain at this plateau for decades.",Riesling
Germany,"Rich without being overly sweet, this wine's aromas are redolent of dried apricots, with a hint of shiitake mushroom as well. Gingery spice balances the honeyed richness on the palate, and extends through the long finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Are the '09 auslesen from Manfred Prüm just in a dull phase? This wine still impresses for its scents of crushed stone and latent power, but the peach, melon and citrus notes fall a little short of expectations for this venerated estate. Give it 10 years or more to come around.",Riesling
Germany,"Light, racy and delicate, with hints of vanilla and coconut adding a sexy layer to the citrus-dominated fruit. There are hints of riper fruit, but this is wonderfully clean and precise, with a long, citrusy finish.",Riesling
Germany,"A big, sturdy auslese, nearly dry in style yet showing some botrytis and plenty of concentration. Hints of dried apricots and mushrooms lead the way, and there is some citrusy character, but this brooding wine is best served with cheeses or savory dishes.",Riesling
Germany,"A medium-bodied auslese that's very sweet but balanced by lime-like acids that extend through the lively finish, with dominant notes of dried apricots and candied pineapple.",Riesling
Germany,"Soft and relatively open in style, with captivating aromas of wet mossy stones and ripe melon and hints of pear and lychee on the palate. Very approachable now for a young Prüm.",Riesling
Germany,"Textbook entry-level Riesling, tightly coiled and medium-bodied, with lovely tension between sweet green-apple fruit notes, minerally hints of crushed stone and zesty acids that recall pink grapefruit. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Loosen's best Dr. L to date, this is a terrific value, delivering typical Mosel Riesling notes at a great price. Citrus blossom, lime and crushed stone aromas are followed by apple and citrus flavors in this just-slightly-sweet wine. Drink it now and over the next year or so.",Riesling
Germany,"Savory notes of saffron and pressed apple are countered by heady blossom and honey on this elegantly balanced Riesling. The palate is unctuously fruity with flavors of sweet peach and hibiscus nectar, but cut with a shock tangerine acidity that reverberates through the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Dusty mineral tones fade to reveal a glorious perfume of blossoms and grapefruit on this elegant, aromatic Riesling. Semi-dry in style, it's pristine with sun-kissed peach and melon flavors accented by a shower of tangerine acidity. Enjoy now for it's youthful beauty.",Riesling
Germany,"Spring blossoms and white peaches perfume this dainty, delicate Riesling. The palate penetrates deeply with apricot and marmalade flavor, but brash lemon-lime acidity and crisp, revitalizing minerality keep the wine refreshing and quaffable.",Riesling
Germany,"Fresh green herbs and zesty white grapefruits scent this brisk, revitalizing Riesling. Sweet peach and mango flavors are concentrated, but bristling layers of wet steel and crushed stone lend a mineral complexity that drives the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Zesty limes and lemons brighten aromas of fresh pear on this irresistibly nimble-bodied Riesling. Ripe tangerine and peach flavors are semi-sweet on the palate, but zippy with acidity and a delicate fringe of minerals that lend complexity to the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Stony mineral notes accent fragrant blossom and grapefruit notes on this dry, elegant Riesling. The palate is lean and steely, with a distinct line of struck steel and lime, but it's also buoyantly fruity with notes of luscious white peach and honey. A dramatic wine with a long, lingering mineral finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Mineral and dry are apt words to describe this intensely smoky, granite-toned Riesling. Zesty lime and lemon notes are razor-sharp, but softened by a swathe of crisp greengage plum and apple flavors.",Riesling
Germany,"Intensely perfumed with notes of white flowers, fresh herbs and citrus rind, this off-dry Riesling is exuberantly floral and fruity from nose to finish. Juicy and ripe, with mango and guava flavors, it bristles with power and energy on the palate.",Riesling
Germany,"Whiffs of turmeric and saffron lend exotic flair to this bracing lemon-lime Riesling. Off-dry in style, it's refreshing and quaffable, yet remarkably complex if you'll give it the time and attention it deserves. Drink now through 2020.",Riesling
Germany,"Fresh cherry blossoms and cranberries breathe zest into luscious notes of preserved black cherry, sweet beets and earth in this ruddy, ripe and yet complex Pinot Noir. Dense on the palate and framed in baby-soft tannins, it's enjoyable now.",Pinot Noir
Germany,"Ginger and saffron intensify the spicy mineral-toned complexities of this gorgeously silky nectar. It's lusciously fruity as well though, boasting cutting white grapefruit and lemon flavors that penetrate through a long, tea-stained finish. Drinks beautifully now but should only intensify through 2024.",Riesling
Germany,"Fresh green florals and melon rind lend a breathlessly cool tone to this elegantly composed dry Riesling. Forward flush yellow plum and gooseberry flavors are offset by lime zest, fresh sage and bristling acidity. It finishes with persistence and length. Drinks well now but should improve through 2020.",Riesling
Germany,"Lime and gooseberry are gilded with candle wax and smoky minerals in this bracing dry Riesling. Lemon and tart tangerine flavors drench the palate, leaving a honed, steely focus on the finish.",Riesling

Germany,"Touches of honey, saffron and spice lend warmth and suppleness to this dry, exceptionally brisk Riesling. It's a bit lean on the palate, but vivaciously fresh, finishing on a deliciously astringent bite of lime pith.",Riesling

Germany,"Smoke and pressed apple notes are savory on the nose, but the palate of this zesty off-dry Riesling is fresh with sweet-tart peach and honeydew. It's refreshing and straightforward in style, but finishes with lingering mineral complexities.",Riesling

Germany,"An unusual late release to the American market, this wine shows its maturity, but elegantly. It still boasts bright black cherry flavor, but also prominent tones of mushroom, earth and leather. Puckery acidity adds freshness to the finish.",Spätburgunder

Drink now.",Riesling

Germany,Unusual aromatics are dominated by hints of zucchini and other green vegetables. There's a pleasant spice theme to the palate but also some very aggressive tannins. Rhubarb flavors show through on the medium finish. Give the tannins a few years to round out.,Pinot Noir
Germany,"Streaks of lanolin and petrol lend a savory, mineral intensity to this off-dry wine. Concentrated yellow peach and nectarine flavors penetrate deeply on the palate, but the moderately long finish reflects its earthier, spicier side.",Riesling

Germany,"At just three years old, this bottle shows some developed petroleum notes that add interest to the often lackluster Silvaner grape. The mouth has an interesting pineapple element, carrying over to the medium finish. This is a relaxed, food-oriented style that would go well with a Mediterranean fish preparation. Drink now.",Silvaner
Germany,"Honest and clean, with white flower charm and a mouthwatering palate that shows nice honeysuckle and lily character. Quince and beeswax come through on the crisp but slightly sweet finish. Drink now or in 2011.",Riesling
Germany,"Clearly in the mineral camp, with aromas of wet stones and gravel taking precedence over the peach fruit. Some nice lanolin and kiwi flavors peek through in the mouth, set against a soft, light-bodied structure. The mineral finish is on the short side. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"A terrific kabinett, Loosen's 2007 WS offers slightly smoky, leesy notes upfront, then adds touches of white peach, pear, vanilla and a trace of cinnamon. It's round and lush on the palate, yet racy at the same time, finishing long and sweet, with a citrusy tinge to the flavors.",Riesling
Germany,"With 3,000 cases imported into the U.S., consumers should still be able to track down some of this sweet, luscious spätlese.

Germany,"Smells a bit like a shady mountain stream, with mossy notes and wet stones, then just explodes with fruit when you taste it, bursting with apple and citrus flavors. Some CO2 adds extra zip, but this has plenty of acid for balance, finishing zesty and long.",Riesling
Germany,"Shows some characteristic Prüm stinky notes, but there's plenty of fruit lurking underneath. Pear, honey, melon and citrus flavors give an impression of great ripeness, amplified by the creamy texture and custardy mouthfeel, but there's also enough crisp acidity for balance. Drink now–2025, maybe longer.",Riesling
Germany,"Dry Mosel wines are rarely very successful and this example is no exception. More residual sugar, less acid or both would have been an improvement. As is, it strikes a shrill note, though the white flower aromatics are undoubtedly appealing.",Riesling
Germany,"Lush aromas of mango and lychee are contradicted by the austere structure of this wine. The acidity is severe and the finish, though it shows some nice nut tones, ends on a drying note. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Aromatic yet not overly complex, with apple, orange and tangerine scents punctuated by faint minerality. The palate is nicely perfumed but a tad on the tart side. Drink up.",Riesling

Germany,"Fresh sage and tarragon notes lend a lovely green, herbal tone to this just off-dry wine. The palate is refreshing with lemony acidity and straightforward apple and pear flavors.",Riesling

Germany,"Four 2007 kabinetts from the Sonnenuhr vineyard in one flight, and all scored 90 points or better, including this beauty, which features white peaches, honeysuckle and a squirt of lime to go along with pear and vanilla notes. It's round and lush yet balanced, if somewhat on the rich, sweet side.",Riesling
Germany,"A terrific value in top-flight Riesling, this kabinett is named for a slate common in the middle Mosel and is sourced from a variety of Loosen's estate vineyards. Apple, cinnamon and slate notes are wonderfully interwoven in a wine that's creamy in texture without any accompanying heaviness. Finishes long and vibrant.",Riesling
Germany,"Aromas are redolent of a candy store—cotton candy, watermelon sours and candied apples. The palate is a sharp contrast, dry, austere and a bit thin. A few years in the cellar will help tame the piercing acidity.",Riesling
Germany,"Opens with exotic notes of musk and summer jasmine, backed up by scents of tangerine. The dry palate is light and more straightforward, wrapping up with a short burst of lemon peel.",Riesling
Germany,"Light and pretty on the nose, with carnations, lemon and just a hint of candied ginger in the background. A tad watery in the mouth, with a short citrus peel aftertaste. Drink up.",Silvaner
Germany,"Baking scents have the upper hand here, along with a sprinkling of fresh citrus tones that glide through to the finish on a slick of biting acidity. Try with chips & dip. Drink up.",Riesling
Germany,"There's definitely something funky going on though the nose is not unappealing, with some nice apricot overtones. Crisp and lightweight, it turns a bit sharp at the end.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts off with some slightly funky, sweaty-socks aromas, but then delivers yellow plum and diesel scents. Flavors run in a similar vein, with yellow and green plum notes nicely balanced by hints of mineral and lees. It's light to medium in body, off-dry, with a long finish featuring finely etched notes of plum and stone.",Riesling
Germany,"Very perfumed and floral, with added scents of lime and strawberry. On the palate, slaty, stony notes and lime flavors balance the considerable sweetness, ending long and stridently tart. The crisp acids give this the backbone to age 10 or more years.",Riesling
Germany,"While many dry wines from the Mosel are overly tart, this offering is a very pleasant exception. It is stony, minerally and a bit austere, offering up the barest hints of peach kernel and spice, but it's also characterful. It finishes with good length, showing firmness alongside dried-spice notes.",Riesling
Germany,"Honey, cream and watermelon notes make for a likable opening. The crisp, citrusy palate is straightforward, with just a hint of softness. Medium lime and fresia finish. Drink now.",Silvaner

Germany,"While the scents are decadent—honey, ginger and candied pineapple—the achingly dry palate makes a tart impression. Try with oysters. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"This white from the Franken region of Germany shows more aromatic intensity than your typical Silvaner, but there's a candied edge here that's a bit offputting. It's crisp in the mouth, with good body and some nice apple notes that linger. Drink now.",Silvaner
Germany,"A bit bland, with some maraschino cherry character along with faint melon rind notes. There's good acidity in the mouth but the short finish of spiced pear leaves behind a soft, slightly muddled impression.",Silvaner
Germany,"The confectionary notes here are a bit over-the-top, with bubblegum and candied pineapple leading into candied ginger in the mouth. It's crisp and light-to-medium-bodied, with a short, apricot finish. Drink up.",Silvaner
Germany,"The nose lacks punch, offering only faint notes of melon and white flowers while the crisp, fairly dry palate sails by on fleeting notes of white raspberry and pomelo. Not one for aging.",Riesling

Germany,"A sweet, plump, succulent spätlese, Bastgen's 2007 Auf den Felsen (on the rocks, referring to the section of the vineyard) features scents of aloe and lime, followed by apple and citrus flavors surrounding a mineral core. Mouthwatering on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Despite the name, this wine is a bit done up aromatically; it's austere and lacking in fruit with just a shy note of lemon zest to soften things. Ultracrisp and dry in the mouth, it has a clean citrusy finish. Drink up.",Riesling
Germany,"This plump, medium-bodied kabinett features scents of pineapple, ginger, cinnamon and slate, while the bold flavors of citrus and spice are tempered by minerality and a touch of pithiness.",Riesling
Germany,"Like many of the J.J. Prüm wines, this one starts off funky smelling, with hints of sweaty socks. But those aromas aren't enough to conceal the underlying notes of apple, citrus and vanilla; decant the wine if you intend to drink it during the next five years or so. It's plump and custardy in texture, with a long, pineappley finish.",Riesling
Germany,"A terrific value, Von Hövel's basic Riesling offers consumers a chance to taste the mineral nature of the Saar's terroir. Notes of slate are almost smoky in their intensity, while the fruit is vibrant and laser-etched in its precision. The apple and lime flavors are delivered aboard a creamy-textured palate, balanced by crisp acids on the off-dry finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Dusty potpourri and mineral tones lend an earthy tone to this lean, off-dry wine. It's fresh with lemon, lime and quince flavors, but straightforward in style with a brisk, herbal finish.",Riesling
Germany,"The Gräflich von Hohenthal'Scher wines are remarkably well priced for single-vineyard offerings.

Germany,"Superstar Egon Müller has at least kept his basic Riesling at an affordable level. At first, it's almost odorless, but give it a chance to develop in the glass and delicate apple, fern and lime notes emerge. A hint of CO2 adds to the impression of lightness, and the wine finishes crisp, racy and clean. A finesse-filled wine likely best in its youth.",Riesling
Germany,"Distinctively oily and petrol-like in aroma, with hints of peaches and minerals. Even the texture is slightly oily, yet this medium-bodied wine finishes clean and fresh.",Riesling
Germany,"This French-sounding brand has turned out a very good German Riesling, thanks to an assist from the folks at Selbach-Oster. It's a light, dry wine with a fair amount of complexity, including hints of pear, melon, wet stone, petrol and peppery spice. Finishes long, with more minerals and spice.",Riesling

Germany,"This is a relatively tame Scheurebe, but one that is therefore easy to drink and enjoy. Some stone-dust minerality adds nuance to the pink grapefruit aromas, while the flavors add a hint of peach. Very fresh and clean on the finish.",Scheurebe
Germany,"From a vineyard possessing light, sandy-pebbly soil, this is a light-bodied Riesling. It's very fresh and delicate in style, with hints of lime and rain-water minerality.",Riesling
Germany,"This blend of four grape varieties is on the dry side, with melon and citrus aromas and flavors. Riesling adds a slight petrol element, while the wine finishes with citrus, spice, verve and length.",White Blend
Germany,"Rather racy and lean for a Pfalz Riesling, with crisp lime sherbet and green apple aromas and flavors. This is light in weight, yet not lacking in power or intensity.",Riesling
Germany,"Wines labeled “Classic” are trocken in style, generally just off-dry. This one delivers scents of honey and peach, while the flavors reflect a sense of dryness, with spice and mineral notes predominating. It's nicely textured on the palate, just comes up a little short on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Beeswax, oranges and crushed stone on the nose, then tangerine and more mineral notes on the palate. It's medium-bodied, prettily plump and succulent before a slightly drying, bitter note emerges on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This is a light, fresh Riesling with just a touch of residual sugar (at 7.5 g/l most people won't really notice it). From a sandy site, it doesn't show great power or complexity, just a pleasing mouthful of easy-to-drink lemon-lime flavors.",Riesling
Germany,"From a famously mineral vineyard site, this wine does show a certain dusty, talcum-powder note of astringency on the finish. It also features modest apple, lemon and lime aromas and flavors reminiscent of pears and citrus. For a spätlese, it's on the dry side, its sugars balanced by crisp acids.",Riesling
Germany,"It's only moderately intense, but this wine still offers a relatively dry yet charming introduction to Pfalz Riesling. Lime and brine aromas and a light texture suggest use as an apéritif or with seafood dishes rather than anything more substantial.",Riesling
Germany,"In how many places in the world would you find an innovative blend of Merlot (60%) and Pinot Noir (40%)? This is a soft, supple wine that reflects those structural aspects of the grapes, adding black cherry and plum flavors and a layer of oaky spice.",Red Blend
Germany,"Shows plenty of barrel influence in its brown sugar and cinnamon aromas, while the flavors run toward cherry, vanilla and coconut. There's a bit of alcoholic warmth to the finish.",Spätburgunder
Germany,"Rather sweet and rich for a kabinett, with peach, tangerine and honey aromas and flavors that comes across as almost a little sticky in their sugary goodness.",Riesling
Germany,"This pretty little Gewürz boasts some fragrant, rose-like aromas, but surprisingly modest spice. Instead, there's plenty of syrupy pear flavors and a burst of citrus on the finish.",Gewürztraminer
Germany,"Reasonably sweet (25 g/l residual sugar) but not overly so, this soft, easy-to-drink wine features melon and citrus notes. It's a light style, pretty and attractive at a good price.",Riesling
Germany,"Reasonably broad and full-bodied, this is a solid example of Chardonnay from the Pfalz. Dried spices accent pineapple and melon fruit, finishing on a crisp, citrusy note.",Chardonnay
Germany,"Despite being largely dry, this is a plump, engaging Riesling with remarkable purity of fruit. Strawberry and pineapple aromas and flavors drive this bus, making it perhaps a touch commercial, but fun all the same. Drink it over the next year or two. Imported by Magellan Wine Imports.",Riesling
Germany,"Blue Fish's Original Riesling is a medium-bodied, off-dry wine in modern packaging. It's broader and less acidic than most Pfalz Rieslings, coating the mouth with hints of vegetable oil and citrus, then falls away quickly on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Broad and mouthfilling, with citrusy overtones to the ripe nectarine fruit and talcum-powder-like minerality. It's not sweet enough to really be a dessert wine, but might pair well with Hunan or Szechuan dishes.",Riesling
Germany,"A good if somewhat generic red wine, blended from Dornfelder, Cabernet Sauvignon and Dunkelfelder. It delivers black cherry fruit, medium body and soft tannins.",Red Blend
Germany,"On the dry side for a kabinett, with the alcohol weighing in at 11%. Yet even though the alcohol is relatively high, the wine gives an impression of lightness, balancing melon and white peach flavors with touches of spice and minerality. Drink now–2012.",Riesling
Germany,"Reasonably dark in color, this coffee-scented Pinot Noir also boasts dark cherry fruit, delicate tannins and a crisp finish. Hints of dried spices and root vegetables add interest. Drink now.",Pinot Noir
Germany,"Made partly from purchased wine, Lingenfelder's Hare Label Gewürztraminer shows varietally correct aromas and flavors of roses, lychees and spice, but also a touch of alcoholic warmth on the finish. It's a round, soft, ample wine that verges on fatness. Not imported.",Gewürztraminer
Germany,"Extreme reflects a level of oaking that may prove controversial. Raw cedary notes mark the nose, while some dark fruit sneaks through on the palate, reflecting the blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah. More wood shows up again on the finish, partially balanced by tart berries.",Red Blend
Germany,"A selection from the Würzburger Innere Leiste, this wine offers something of a conundrum: the aromas and flavors are on one hand those of cooked or stewed fruit, while at the same time the wine is light-bodied, silky and vibrant. Worth a try.",Spätburgunder
Germany,"Exceeds even this producer's stunning beerenauslese, featuring an even more intoxicating perfume of honey, dried apricots and candied pineapple, with slightly more acidity to provide balance to the extra level of sweetness, so much so that this wine comes across as refreshing on the finish, despite the incredibly high levels of sugar. Drink now–2050, possibly longer.",Riesling
Germany,"From a vintage not known for its supersweet selections, this wine is a revelation. Honey and bergamot notes mingle easily on the nose, while the palate unfolds to reveal layers of honey, dried apricots and orange marmalade. It's rich, viscous and concentrated without any heaviness, with a finish that's sweet and lingering. This should age through 2040 easily.",Riesling
Germany,"This bottling seems pretty variable from year to year, with the 2006 version being somewhat sweet and simple. It offers pear and lime flavors on a compact frame, finishing clean but short.",Gewürztraminer
Germany,"Even if 2006 is not the best vintage for Pinot Noir in the Pfalz, Knipser's basic bottling is still a solid, light to medium-weight red. Brown sugar and grilled beet-root aromas give way to toasty, woody flavors that include cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla.",Spätburgunder
Germany,An off-dry style that comes across as a bit soft. Petrolly aromas of oil shale give way to fruitier notes of apple and citrus that could use a little more zest on the finish. Decent for the price.,Riesling
Germany,"Broad and soft, with attractive aromas of lychees and rose petals but only modest flavor intensity and a slightly earthy, spicy finish.",Gewürztraminer
Germany,"Sweet and soft, with ample melon and tangerine flavors combining in this medium-bodied blend that ends up seeming neither very Gewürz-like nor very Riesling-like.",Gewürztraminer-Riesling
Germany,"This is a light-bodied Pinot Noir, perfectly fine for the price. Some mushroomy elements don't mesh perfectly with the otherwise confected maraschino cherry fruit, but the wine is varietally recognizable, with lithe tannins and a fresh, slightly herbal finish.",Pinot Noir
Germany,"Hugely sweet and decadent, this is a tour de force of botrytized winemaking. Honeyed citrus aromas are buoyed by hints of perfume and spice, with dried apricot flavors accented by spiced honey. Mouthcoating, rich and impossibly long, this wine should easily age for 40 or more years.",Riesling
Germany,"This is intriguingly scented stuff, with hints of honey, musk and truffles that come together harmoniously. The flavors run along similar veins, being complex and sweet without being obviously fruity; this is not a dry wine (28.9 g/L residual sugar). Finishes a bit soft; drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Enticingly complex nose, multifaceted, with a medley of blossoms, honey, spice, white peaches and ample minerality showing through. Sweet, with delicious racy acidity and a lively taut texture. This is very focused, with generous flavors of elderberries, stone fruit, orange citrus, spice and slate. Long, persistent finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Schloss Saarstein's auslese is remarkably consistent year to year, testament to the greatness of the site and the quality of the farming and winemaking. The 2008 features cool, slate-driven scents softened just slightly by hints of superripe apples and ripe apricot. This medium-bodied wine is clean and tightly focused, with the sweetness admirably balanced by crisp acids. Should age 15 years or more.",Riesling
Germany,"This succulent, almost tender, wine starts off with lovely aromas of honey and bergamot, adding hints of apricot and vanilla in the mouth. It's a soft, lush style, rather sweet, with a long, mouthwatering finish. It may not be as long-lived as some 2007s, but it should remain delectable for another 10 years or so.",Riesling
Germany,"Realistically priced for genuine German eiswein, this is also rather alcoholic for most, weighing in at 10% abv. So it may not be as sweet as expected, but it still shows razor-like focus, with the residual sweetness balanced by bright pink grapefruit and pineapple notes.",Riesling
Germany,"Shows lovely balance between intense sweetness and crisp acidity, so that the wine's honeyed citrus notes really sing. Hints of marmalade, clove and a perfumed, slightly minty note all add complexity. Delicious now, and probably for a good many years to come.",Riesling
Germany,"A complete contrast to the 2007, probably reflecting some of the difficulties of the vintage. This is tart and hard, with dull earthy aromas and just hints of citrus and melon.",Pinot Blanc
Germany,"Simple, fruity—cantaloupe, strawberry and peach—and sweet, with a definite struck match note to its aromas, this is reminiscent of a mediocre Rosé d'Anjou, minus the herbal aspects.",Pinot Noir
Germany,"Mid gold in color, this wine displays unctuous aromas of honey, ripe apricot, wildflowers and slate. Sweet, but has a lovely raciness on the palate. The plump peach and apricot flavors are layered with hints of anise, slate and honey that come across as very pure and elegant. Taut, focused palate and a long, juicy minerally finish.",Riesling
Germany,"A lush, sweet auslese, the 2008 Jesuitengarten from von Bassermann-Jordan is unctuous in texture and laden with tropical fruit, with just enough citrus for balance. It finishes long and sweet, but clean, inviting one back for another sip. Drink now–2025, possibly longer.",Riesling
Germany,"This wonderful auslese offers volume and richness without weight—it's a sort of fluffy custard in texture, loaded with funky, leesy notes on the nose but also with passion fruit, green apple and pineapple notes on the palate. Yes, it's sweet, but the acids provide beautiful balance on the finish. Drink now–2025.",Riesling
Germany,"The scents of this wine speak indubitably of its place, running the gamut of classic descriptors from apple and lime to honey and slate. It's dry and lithe on the palate, combining citrus and crushed-stone flavors, and finishing crisp and clean.",Riesling
Germany,"Importer Rudi Wiest with the help of Robert Eymael has found a fruity, off-dry Riesling at a great price. The melon, spice and citrus flavors are delivered via a palate that's a little broad, but finish clean. With a little more zip, this would be even better.",Riesling
Germany,"A Riesling with an enticing nose of honeysuckle and other summer blossoms, stone fruit and focused stony minerality. There's a wonderfully taut palate, fantastically racy and refreshing, with layers of persistent flavor intensity. The minerality stays with you all the way to a very long lingering finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This auslese is less obviously fruity than many of Loosen's recent efforts, with a smoky, fuel-oil overlay to the honeyed and stone-like flavors. At only 7.5% alcohol, it's sweet yet not heavy, balanced by bright acidity and a hint of prickly CO2 still in evidence. Drink it over the next 15–20 years.",Riesling
Germany,"A departure from the last couple of vintages, with a unique scent of chestnuts adding interest to the sweet, concentrated notes of honey and orange marmalade. It's an odd, different accent, yet the balance of sweetness and bracing acidity is spot on.",Riesling
Germany,"Pale gold in color. The attractive nose features ripe yellow stone fruit with strong mineral overtones, while the palate reveals enough crisp, refreshing acidity to balance the sweetness. There's a smooth, rich texture, showing ample flavors of ripe stone fruit, floral notes and honey. Concentrated, with a moderately long, fresh finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Moderately sweet and viscous, without the intense concentration seen in some of the vintage's BAs, this remains a skilfully balanced wine, with candied pineapple, citrus and honey balanced by fresh acidity. Drink it over the next 25 years or so.",Riesling
Germany,"Fairly broad aromas show some evolution with honey notes adding intrigue to ripe stone fruit and floral notes. Medium-sweet, but balanced and taut, with a juicy, crisp texture and lots of minerality on the palate. Persistent layers of flavors with honey, apricot, peach, spice showing nicely. Long minerally finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This is awfully creamy and lush for a kabinett, but yummy at the same time. Some hints of lees and funk add complexity to the sweet green apple, passion fruit and lime flavors. Finishes long, with lingering notes of crushed stone, citrus and honey.",Riesling
Germany,"Inviting layered aromas of ripe stone fruit, hints of citrus and some earthy spice and minerality. Crisp and refreshing. Very good depth and intensity of lively youthful fruit with a strong mineral core adding complexity. Medium sweet and balanced with a long finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Nicely layered, with inviting fusel notes, ripe yellow fruit and honey aromas. Very minerally. Deliciously crisp, juicy and focused with a nicely taut palate. Lovely rich texture, racy and balanced. Medium sweet, with ample flavor depth—stone fruit, hints of guava, citrus and persistent minerality on a long finish.",Riesling
Germany,"A delicate nose of complex aromas with striking stony minerality goes alongside aromas of honeysuckle, white lilac, elder flower and white peach. Very taut yet filigreed on the palate, this pale, lemon-colored wine is sweet, yet crisp and poised. Ample juicy ripe fruit flavors persist across the palate and lead to a long and layered, refreshing finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Complex, intense nose of fresh honeysuckle, tangerines, marmalade, spice, dried apricots, golden raisins and an earthy minerality abound. Delightfully rich and sweet, but lively and fresh, with nicely balanced racy acidity. Generous concentration of flavor that coats the whole palate and lingers to a sweet but vibrantly juicy finish.",Riesling
Germany,"To judge by the codes on the label, this Best Buy is from the same bottler who did Rudi Wiest's 2007 Mosel River. This is slightly lighter in weight, with simple apple and citrus flavors tinged with petrol. Off-dry, but clean and fresh on the finish. A wine to drink now and over the next few months.",Riesling
Germany,"A pale, lemon color Riesling. The complex nose of honey, delicate stone fruit, elder-flower and stony minerality is deliciously inviting, while intense, focused ripe fruit prevails all across the palate. This is sweet, yet crisp and oozing freshness, with a taut, lively texture. Very long, complex and subtle at the same time.",Riesling
Germany,"Medium gold in color. Attractive nose, quite citrussy, orange with floral notes and a touch of honey. Layered and reasonably complex. Dry and richly textured on the palate and medium bodied. Nicely taut and well balanced with ample ripe orchard and melon fruit. Evident minerality right across the palate to the finish, which is persistent, layered and savory.",Chardonnay
Germany,"A wine with an inviting nose of ripe fruit, layered with notes of honey and lovely, savory-earthy minerality. This is broad across the palate, with a smooth rich texture. Dry and fresh, featuring ample flavors of ripe orchard and stone fruit, with spice and balsamic notes adding complexity. Long length and a persistent savory finish.",Weissburgunder
Germany,"Pale lemony color. Some initial reductive notes blow off to reveal a classic Mosel nose of delicate flowers, white stone fruit and slate. Crisp, elegant, juicy and packed with mouthwatering stone fruit and citrus flavors. Very minerally, taut and focused, with tremendous length and a persistent, juicy finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Lemon in color, with pronounced floral aromas—elder-flower, honeysuckle and acacia—alongside white peaches and nectarines. There's a strong mineral focus on the nose. Sweet, yet deliciously crisp and juicy, with ample flavor concentration. Taut and lively, and has a long minerally finish.",Riesling
Germany,"A dry, stony, somewhat neutral wine, marked by crisp acids and vaguely apple-y fruit. The crispnesss and austerity would make it a fine foil for creamy or oily fish dishes.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts off with scents of slate, pineapple and vanilla, then delivers apple, melon and lime sherbet flavors. It's off-dry, light in body, and easy enough to drink now and over the next six months or so.",Riesling

Germany,"Inviting nose of intense mellow, yellow fruit with notably focused minerality, some spice and a hint of flowers. Off dry and beautifully balanced by the crisp acidity and generous flavors of delicious, juicy fruit, this is richly textured, yet taut and elegant. Long, persistent, layered finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Delicate lemony color. Fragrant nose of peach and apricot crème pastry, with hints of sherbet and grapefruit and a stony mineral focus. Crisp, racy with a youthful fruit cocktail medley of flavors. Light-bodied but focused and taut. Not hugely concentrated, but well balanced and persistent.",Riesling
Germany,"At 250,000 cases imported, this has to be one of the biggest brands of Riesling on the market.

Germany,"Mid-gold in color, featuring broad, layered aromas of ripe yellow stone fruit, ruby red grapefruit and mineral notes.

Racy acidity balances the sweetness, as does its firm, taut texture, which gives the wine focus.",Riesling
Germany,"Wow. This gorgeous dessert-style auslese explodes from the glass in a cavalcade of sweet fruit and spice. Honeyed peaches and dried apricots are most prominent, but shadings of cinnamon and allspice give complexity, while crisp acids provide impeccable balance on the long finish. Delicious now, this wine should easily evolve for up to 40 years.",Riesling
Germany,"Slight hint of sulfur at first, but it blows off and the nose opens to reveal a rich medley of ripe orchard fruit tinged with dried tarragon and savory spice. Crisp, bright and laden with a patchwork of flavors: ripe apples, pears and stone fruit against a backdrop of earthy minerality. Broad yet only medium bodied, with a moderately long finish.",Chardonnay Weissburgunder
Germany,"As with all of the Dr. Loosen wines, this blended kabinett is very fruit-forward and direct. The green apple and lime notes are wonderfully pure and balanced. Drink this light, spritely wine over the next few years.",Riesling

The finish is virtually endless. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",Riesling
Germany,"Filled with minerality, spice and everything nice, this incredibly intense wine is also filled with honey, gently caramelized peaches and citrus. It's got huge presence on the palate and a virtually endless, sweet finish. It should evolve gracefully for 50 or more years.",Riesling
Germany,"At only 6% alcohol, this is extremely honeyed on the nose—almost caramelized in its intensity. This is amply reflected on the palate, where its flavors are ultrasweet, like melted peach preserves and honey. Lingers terrifically on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This is a big step up in quality from Erbes' one-star bottling this vintage, offering greater intensity, purity and raciness. Aromas of rock dust set the stage for a wine of intense minerality, balanced by sweet flavors of melon and honey. Bergamot and spice notes linger elegantly on the long finish. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",Riesling

Germany,"With 150 cases imported, this may be one of the most available top ausleses from the 2006 vintage, and it's a good one. Aromas and flavors of crushed stone, pineapple and dried apricot form a wonderful marriage, while the wine's intense sweetness is balanced by crisp acids. Finishes long, with echoes of mineral and citrus. Drink now–2030, maybe longer.",Riesling
Germany,"Not quite as extremely sweet as some of the giant BAs from 2006, this wine actually shows a modicum of minerality and spice to go along with hints of dried apricot and honey. It doesn't finish as long or powerful as some, but instead shows a certain elegance and balance.",Riesling

Germany,"This is thick, rich and very beerenauslese-like, combining honey and dried apricot aromas with similar flavors and a touch of candied pineapple. It's sweeter and richer than the regular auslese, but only more appealing for true sugar hounds, who'll admire its extreme viscosity and long, mouthcoating finish.",Riesling

Germany,"On the drier side for an auslese, with the alcohol reaching 10%, this wine features hints of apricot and pineapple marmalade, but there are also less pristine earthy, fungal notes that some may read as complex while others may find them slightly dirty. Crisp and linear on the finish. Drink now–2015.",Riesling

They form a solid spine from which the opulent flavors of superripe pineapple and honeyed citrus are suspended. Finishes with verve and a flourish of crushed-stone minerality.",Riesling
Germany,"Not a stereotypical fruity Riesling, the 2009 Qvinterra features plenty of savory, umami-like notes of broth and brine to go along with hints of sun-warmed peaches. It's medium bodied, with a long, velvety-textured finish unusual for a white wine. Intriguing.",Riesling

Germany,"Shows ample complexity on the nose, offering up hints of dried apricot and crushed stone to go alongside dominant notes of superripe apple.

Drink over the next 5–10 years.",Riesling
Germany,"Thick, viscous and sweet, Erbes' one-star auslese lacks the finesse and racy elegance of the best examples, but still offers sweet flavors of dried pineapple and ripe melon, balanced by hints of petrol.

Germany,"Fresh-smelling, like citrus and green herbs or grass, this medium-bodied Riesling is not very fruity, displaying a more sandstone-mineral character on the palate. There's a vaguely umami aspect to it as well, as it ends on a mouthwatering beefy or briny note. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Silvaner isn't exactly the world's best known grape variety, but if more of them were this good, it would gain a larger following. This wine is full-bodied and close to bone dry, with a creamy texture that carries its intense flavors of mineral and spice across the palate to a long, satisfying close.",Silvaner
Germany,"This offering from the Mosel's most hallowed site starts off thick and unctuous in the mouth, yet lacks the persistence and intensity of flavor exhibited by some of its 2006 counterparts. Still, the aromas and flavors present a gorgeous mix of dried apricot, ripe pear and melon with touches of honey and restrained minerality.",Riesling
Germany,"Scents of ripe apples and a hint of dried apricot are pleasant enough, but the wine is simple and sweet, lacking richness or depth.",Riesling
Germany,This one tries to capitalize on the trendiness of rosé and Pinot Noir but ultimately only succeeds in putting forth some vaguely melony flavors and hinting at strawberry on the sweet finish.,Pinot Noir
Germany,"Fresh and fruity on the nose, this wine's pear and apple flavors turn sweet and a bit heavy on the palate. There's a refreshing bite on the finish, but not quite enough to lighten the midpalate.",Riesling
Germany,"Lithe and streamlined, with spare fruit aboard a minerally frame. Kerosene and petrol notes dominate, ending with a burst of fresh lime-like flavors.",Riesling
Germany,"Ripe aromas of fig, marmalade and honey, with hints of resin and balsamic. This is sweet and richly textured, but slightly heavy and low in acid. Moderately high flavor intensity showing similar flavors as on the nose. Fairly long, but shows a touch bitterness on the finish.",Gewürztraminer
Germany,"An attractive nose of wild strawberries, red currants and cranberries is followed by a dry, nicely round feeling on the palate, with a medley of ripe wild forest fruit and a savory earthy note. This medium-bodied wine displays ample flavor intensity and a smooth, moderately long finish.",Rosé
Germany,"An unoaked blend of 68% Chardonnay and 32% Pinot Blanc, with the peach and sweet-corn Chard flavors to pair with the orange and grapefruit notes of the Pinot Blanc. It's round and mouthfilling, finishing with hints of spice and citrus. Drink now.",Chardonnay-Pinot Blanc
Germany,"Slaty minerality frames bold pineapple and lime aromas and flavors in this medium-bodied, nearly dry Riesling. Fresh and minerally on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This is a lithe, sinewy wine, powerful yet lean, with coiled intensity to its crisp citrus and mineral flavors. It finishes long and tart, with the bracing acids suggestive of a long evolution. Hold 3–5 years and see if it blossoms.",Riesling
Germany,"Light in weight, but distressingly lacking in flavor as well, with modest melon and anise notes that finish soft and short.",Riesling
Germany,"The aromas speak to the uniqueness of the grape variety, offering up funky pink grapefruit and ginger notes, but the flavors are overly sweet, lacking proper balance.",Scheurebe
Germany,"Light in weight, as expected from the Mosel, but it also lacks richness or depth. There's a burnt matchstick note to the aromas, then simple, short-lived flavors of melon and citrus. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",Riesling
Germany,"This thick, oily-textured wine lacks the freshness and vibrance expected from a Mosel Riesling, but does offer some suggestion of minerality and some vaguely apple-like fruit.",Riesling
Germany,"Pale ruby color. Predominantly earthy savory aromas with hints of baked red fruit. Medium bodied, slightly chunky and rustic, with grippy tannins, but ample flavors of ripe red fruits and earthy minerality. Fairly long finish.",Pinot Noir
Germany,"Pale copper in color, this is a lean, angular rosé that's rather neutral on the nose, then offers only sour cherry flavors on the tart finish.",Spätburgunder
Germany,"Despite a laudable pale copper color, this wine has a rather coarse, tannic texture that dampens its melon and appleskin flavors. Turns slightly bitter on the finish.",Pinot Noir
Germany,"Fairly intense aromas of jammy black and red fruit: plums, blackberries and cassis, with notes of coffee and vanilla. On the palate, this is warm, with lots of sweet baking spices and baked black fruit. Fairly simple with a slightly syrupy texture and a warm, spicy finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Germany,"Mid-gold in color, with a richly honeyed nose, slightly caramel like, showing ultraripe yellow fruits, spice and earthy tuber notes. Earthiness and sweet ripeness follow through on the palate, but it tastes quite fresh. Loose knit, but simple and easy drinking. Finishes slightly short with a resinous kick.",Riesling
Germany,"Part of Dr. Loosen's stable, this is a reasonably dry Riesling at a reasonable price. Petrichor and grapefruit lead the way, with hints of riper citrus fruits helping to round out the midpalate. Ends on notes of anise, crushed stone and citrus.",Riesling
Germany,"This is a broad, sweet, full-bodied dessert wine that lacks the crisp acids necessary for a higher degree of balance. Instead, it delivers intense honey and pineapple flavors that stick stubbornly to the palate. Probably best with sweet desserts.",Silvaner
Germany,"On the dry side, this medium-bodied kabinett clocks in at 11% alcohol but seems balanced anyway, with peach and pear aromas and flavors given complexity through notes of smoke, clover blossom and mint. Crisp and refreshing on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"A blend of Weissburgunder and Sylvaner, this accessibly priced Icewine features aromas of honey, caramel and citrus, with flavors of honey, tea and citrus that are sweet and enjoyable without being profound. Overall, it's soft and sweet; fine as an affordable by-the-glass offering.",White Blend
Germany,"This sweet spätlese displays some rather funky, sweaty aromas, but also ample apple and citrus fruit, and the resulting combination is both likable and complex. The crisp, green-apple finish fades a bit quickly, but this is a pleasant warm-weather sipper.",Riesling
Germany,"Pale lemon in color. Restrained at first and quite reduced, but opens up in the glass to show appealing citrus and white peach aromas. Crisp and juicy, with citrus flavors predominating—tangerine, ruby red grapefruit and meyer lemon. Medium sweet, refreshing but slightly short on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"To judge by its nose, this medium-bodied Riesling is quiet and introverted. And the flavors are also relatively neutral, with a slight earthiness and savory character defining its profile. Has the same lingering beefy-brininess on the finish as the other Liebfruenstift wines, just not as intense.",Riesling
Germany,"Raimund Prüm's Blue Slate is developing into a consistent performer, marrying hints of ripe fruit—peach or nectarine and melon—with crisp citrusy notes and an underlying minerality that gives it an almost dry finish. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Quite subdued on the nose, with delicate notes of mixed wild berries and a savory earthiness. Light-bodied and refreshing, with soft tannins and moderate intensity of red berries: cranberries, loganberries and wild strawberries. Fairly simple, but an honest, pale ruby-colored  wine.",Pinot Noir
Germany,"A bit lighter in body and fruitier in style than the very similar 2009 Kirchenschlüssel, this dry Riesling displays crisp apple and citrus flavors alongside deeper, earthier, more savory notes.",Riesling
Germany,"Frankly sweet and almost flabby, with plenty of sugar, petrolly minerality and ripe pear flavors, but this wine lacks the buoyant citrusy zest needed for balance and length.",Riesling
Germany,This is a plump Pinot Gris that does show a bit of its 13.5% alcohol. Pleasant smoke and citrus aromas give way to grapefruit and spice flavors that fade a bit quickly on the finish.,Pinot Gris
Germany,"Candied nose of sweet red currants, cherries and savory herbs. On the palate, this is quite warm, with mild cherry compote, forest floor and earthy flavors. Simple and a little dilute, but easy drinking, with a pleasantly fruity finish.",Rosé
Germany,"A medium-bodied, dry Silvaner, with modestly earthy, minerally and grapefruity aromas and citrus and mineral flavors. It finishes clean and fresh, with only 11% alcohol. Serve as an apéritif, alone or with passed hors d'oeuvres.",Silvaner
Germany,"Much lighter in weight than many Pinot Gris on the market, this is a pretty, fruit-driven rendering of the variety, blending tropical fruit with ripe apples and hints of pink grapefruit. It's crisp and clean on the finish.",Pinot Gris
Germany,"Mid-gold in color. Earthy, heady, herbal nose with notes of tangy lime marmalade. Sweet, with a creamy, smooth texture. Tangy citrus flavors follow through with hints of resinous herbs. Pleasant and easy-drinking but with only moderate length and an earthy finish",Gewürztraminer
Germany,"Shows a weaker side of the 2006 vintage, with an overly broad mouthfeel and a certain lack of precision, but still boasts ripe apple and melon flavors.",Riesling
Germany,"Offers plenty of citrus, spanning the spectrum from lime to orange and tangerine, with just a hint of nectarine mixed in. At 8.5% alcohol, this kabinett gives an impression close to dryness, and despite despite relatively soft acids on the finish, it's nicely balanced.",Riesling
Germany,"Sweet and broad, with obvious spice, lychee and rose-petal aromatics but a disappointing lack of follow-through on the finish. It's good, but could use more vibrance and length.",Gewürztraminer
Germany,"Pale gold in color. Slightly sweet and candied aromas prevail: pear drops and white flowers. Similar flavors appear on the fairly light-bodied palate. This is fresh, fruity and easy to drink, but lacking any great depth or flavor intensity. A slight bitter note is noticeable on the finish.",Pinot Gris
Germany,"Pale ruby core with slight garnet rim. Moderately intense earthy aromas, leather, dried cherries and a hint of caramel  draw you in, while the palate is medium-bodied, with a rustic grip to the tannins. Fairly warm and chunky in texture, with flavors of ripe baked red fruits. Crisp acidity helps keep the balance. Slightly hot on the finish.",Pinot Noir
Germany,"Raumland's Marie-Luise is a blanc de noirs of 100% Pinot Noir that comes across as toasty and nutty on the nose and palate, without obvious red-berry fruitiness or the earthy, sous-bois complexity of the variety. That said, it is medium in body and does make for a nice glass of bottle-matured sparkling.",Sparkling Blend
Germany,"Supersweet and cloying, with one-dimensional honey and barley-sugar aromas and flavors. Disappointing.",Riesling
Germany,"The flight of Rheingau dessert wines this appeared in was almost universally disappointing. Like most of the others, this showed some excessively earthy aromas and flavors, although it did possess ample sweetness and attractive musk and spice notes.",Riesling
Germany,"Sweet, rich and soft, this is a nice wine, but in the context of site, producer and vintage, a bit of a disappointment. Honey and clove flavors lack extra dimensions of complexity and focus, finishing without the expected balancing zing of acidity.",Riesling
Germany,"There's a simple nose of tangy orange marmalade on this medium-gold colored wine. Similar flavors follow through on the palate with zingy lime-sherbet notes. Sweet but racy enough to compensate. Still, this is a bit one dimensional and lacking depth of flavor. Pleasant and easy-drinking, with moderate length.",Gewürztraminer
Germany,"An odd bird, this wine is almost pungent, with intense, earthy aromas that carry a nutty edge. It's hugely thick and viscous (and sweet), but the candied orange flavors lack a bit of balancing acidity.",Riesling
Germany,". Light to medium in body, this wine's modest cherry fruit is largely submerged under a layer of smoky oak. Cola and coffee flavors dominate, ending on a tart note.",Pinot Noir
Germany,"Relatively plump and succulent for a “Dry Riesling”, with honeyed, musky notes that accent ripe peach and dusty mineral flavors. Not quite dry on the finish, but powered by crisp acidity.",Riesling
Germany,"Tastes better than it smells, with strongly herbal aromas that seem almost cabbage-like giving way to flavors of cola and black cherries. Light in weight, it finishes crisply acidic, without much tannin.",Spätburgunder
Germany,"Excessively woody, with powerful smoke and cedar notes that cover modest beet flavors. The bouquet features additional oak-derived scents of vanilla and an odd, marzipan-like quality. Oak fans will think this wine's been underrated.",Spätburgunder
Germany,"This hard, stony-textured wine will be tough to warm up to for some, while rock-heads will extol its minerally virtues. Hints of lime and green plum keep it from being too austere, while it finishes cool and long.",Riesling
Germany,"This lightweight Pinot could use a larger helping of fruit. There's plenty of the earthy complexity you want in Pinot Noir—smoke, earth, beet root, mushrooms—but it all fades quickly, turning dull, with drying tannins on the finish.",Pinot Noir
Germany,"Perfumed and floral on the nose, but there's also a fair degree of crushed stone buffered by hints of green apple and citrus. Flavors are strongly floral and mineral, then finish stony and dry.",Riesling
Germany,"A full bouquet with tropical fruit, floral notes and vanilla accents opens this very friendly and lively Riesling. This offers a lot—bright and pretty orange and lime flavors and a brisk, zingy mouthfeel from the citrusy fruit and the underlying acidity. The full finish features spicy tarragon notes on top of the fruit. More Americans should try with wines like this. Best Buy.",Riesling
Germany,"Dr. Loosen's Kabinett wines sometimes approach the Spätlese level of concentration and flavor; this Spätlese could be someone's Auslese. It's decadently ripe, a rich mouthful of peaches, apricots, orange and pineapple, almost viscous and floral-honey sweet. Which is not to say it lacks acidity, structure or balance. Wonderful, spicy-sweet cinnamon and nutmeg accents offset the fruit, there's a somewhat grainy palate texture, like ultraripe pears. Finishes long.",Riesling
Germany,"A floral and lightly citric nose introduces this dry, crisply elegant Riesling. The wine cleanses the palate with compact and detailed  flavors and leaves you reaching quickly for the next sip. This brand new wine for Breuer is designed especially for early consumption and wine-by-the-glass programs, and fulfills its mission beautifully. Best Buy.",Riesling
Germany,"Smells crisp and steely, full of limes and green apples, then turns softer on the palate where ripe pears and MacIntosh apples take over. It's delicately off-dry, balanced by adequate acidity that extends through the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Montosa is a proprietary wine from Breuer's vineyards. Attractively aromatic it displays ripe pear, kiwi and tangerine scents wiht a hint of petrol. On the palate it's like a crisp green apple, offset by stony accents and showing bright acidity. The crisp finish shows good length.",Riesling
Germany,"This is a proprietary blend of grapes that may include Lemberger, Dornfelder, Cabernet, Merlot and Sangiovese. It surprises, with handsome and ripe loganberry and black cherry fruit offset by dark, tarry, smoky barrel flavors with a chocolatey undercurrent. There's brisk acidity, but the fruit is ripe, clean and interesting, and proves that in the right hands red grapes can work in Germany's warmer Pfalz region.",Red Blend
Germany,"A lovely bouquet of ripe peach, apricot and lemon notes. Fairly round peach, tart apple and earth flavors play on the palate and linger through the clean finish with its green apple and crisp mineral elements. From a well-regarded vineyard on a heart-stopping vertical slope, known for its elegant wines, everything here is beautifully defined. This will age well.",Riesling
Germany,"Smells ripe, with honey and pear aromas that fold in apples and tangerines. The apples and pears continue on the palate, accented by baking spices—cinnamon, clove and allspice or nutmeg. The acidity is low, making this a candidate to drink now with your favorite Asian cuisine.",Riesling
Germany,"Scents of soft ripe pears are complemented by citrus and floral nuances. Turns spicy and lean on the palate, with flavors of cinnamon and clove making for an almost dusty mouthful that's even a bit austere.",Riesling
Germany,"The name translates as “the slate of Bernkastel” and this wine lives up to its name. Peachy-tropical ripe fruit is offset nicely by the pronounced mineral scent and texture, and a slight spritz. The stony side of its nature glides into a chalk-tinged, palate-cleansing finish with sweet pear flavors.",Riesling
Germany,"Floral and pineapple aromas and a touch of musky spice on the nose open this medium weight Riesling. Shows a slightly lean profile, pear/apple and lemon flavors and a decent acid spine. Turns sharper on the back end with pepper, spice and very tart citrus and green apple notes.",Riesling
Germany,"This has good, juicy fruit, with green apples, green berries, and limes leading the way. There's just a hint of white peaches too, and a full, spicy mouthfeel. It gathers strength in the finish, with hints of anise and herb.",Riesling
Germany,"The smooth, citrus-scented nose that opens this wine shows an interesting, faint candlewax-like note. Vivid, focused fruit follows—kiwi and green berries dominate—with bracing acids and a crisp slatey bottom. Fine balance keeps it light and lively despite the ripe fruit, and it extends into a clean finish of medium length.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts off with beautiful scents of minerals, dried spices and a hint of peach, but not quite as attractive on the palate, where it seems heavy at times despite some unreleased CO2. Then it turns tangy-tart on the finish. This youthful wine comes across as a bit disjointed; hopefully, that will improve over the next few months in bottle and this rating will look conservative.",Riesling
Germany,"It's an intriguing idea to blend fruit from the Rhine and the Mosel, theoretically balancing the best qualities of each. Astute tasters will catch a little bit of that in this wine, with darker spice notes playing against brighter floral nuances. The result is a pleasant if rather generic Riesling that finishes with soft pear and melon fruit.",Riesling
Germany,"This is solid, journeyman Riesling offering a full grapey bouquet with diesel and earth accents. Grape and mild citrus flavors play on the easy mouthfeel and the decently long, slightly mineral finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This straight-ahead bottling from the Loosen brothers is simply labeled Riesling.It has a surprisingly rich nose with hints of hay, diesel and citrus, while the palate shows ripe, concentrated yellow fruits. Low in alcohol (8.5%) and modest in price, this is a perfect introduction to Mosel Riesling and a great everyday wine for our Chardonnay-obsessed land. Best Buy.",Riesling
Germany,"A plump, off-dry Riesling imported in relatively large quantities (30,000 cases), this is a notable reintroduction to the grape variety. Has basic Mosel characteristics of green apple and lime aromas and flavors. There's even a soft, slightly mineral finish.",Riesling
Germany,"A nicely complex nose of apple, lemon and herbs gives way to a dry, smooth mouth full of grape flavor. An even, if slightly thin mouthfeel and smooth finish wrap it up nicely. It strikes one that Riesling is the only variety--certainly the variety that most often--does taste like grapes, as opposed to other fruits.",Riesling
Germany,"This rather rustic wine in a round wide ""bock"" bottle has a round mouthfeel, simple and earthy aromas and flavors. But a ripe, fermenting-hay note begins on the nose, continues into the mid-palate where it becomes a musty mature element on the straightforward grape flavors. Still, it might work with sausages or other country fare.",Riesling
Germany,"This citrusy wine is a bit of a one-note wonder, but it performs that note well, featuring strident lime aromas and a zippy, dry finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Light and dry, with scents of limes, fresh ferns and green apple. Flavors of green apple and citrus finish crisp and clean.",Riesling
Germany,"Smells solid, showing hints of honey and melon layered over some stony notes, but turns dull and earthy on the palate, then roughly acidic on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"An elegant Chardonnay-based sekt, with mineral notes accented by a fine bead and appe, citrus and spice components in pleasant balance. Creamy and smooth in the mouth, with a lingering finish.",Chardonnay
Germany,"Crisp and assertive, with boldly fruity aromas of apple, pear, pineapple and melon. No yeastiness to speak of, just bright fruit and froth in a dry, fresh format. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Prüm's 2007 Sonnenuhr auslese shows a typical youthful yeasty-leesy-sulfur funk, but also layers of ripe pear and citrus fruit lurking underneath. It's sweet but wonderfully balanced, plump and creamy in texture and long on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This fruit-forward, honeyed wine is irresistably drinkable. Has pronounced aromas of baked custard and creme caramel and wildflowers at their scented peak, and drinks vibrantly fruity and rich. Beautiful acidity creates balance.",Riesling
Germany,"Slightly toasty on the nose, but there's plenty of fresh fruit as well, ranging from apple to pineapple and tangerine. Clean, fresh and easy to drink and enjoy.",Riesling
Germany,"This auslese shows a wonderfully lithe and racy character that's different from this house's typical style. Crushed stone, apple, citrus and a trace of vanilla bean mark the nose, followed by flavors of pineapple inlaid with filigreed minerality.",Riesling
Germany,"This terrific dry Riesling features a complex interplay of mineral notes, honey, peach, citrus and dried spices. At 12.5% alcohol, it's pretty full-bodied and richly textured, with touches of lingering honey and citrus on the long, mineral-inflected finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Full-bodied and viscous without being overly sweet, this intense, powerful expression of Riesling features hints of apricot, bold green apple and lime notes and a touch of mushroom. The finish boasts heaps of spice and crisp acids for balance, trailing away ever so slowly.",Riesling
Germany,"This auslese shows tremendously lush fruit and a wonderful sense of purity to its aromas and flavors. Scents of pineapple, vanilla and crushed stone lead the way, followed by notes of tropical fruit wrapped around a core of slate. Drink now–2015.",Riesling
Germany,"This youthful auslese is still showing a lot of postfermentation estery characters: it's very perfumed and floral, with such tropical notes as banana and pineapple. The fruit is nearly overwhelming, and the wine is on the sweet side, so it's easy to overlook the underlying minerality, but it's there. Worth cellaring until at least 2015.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine's initial aromatics come across as rather subdued, but give them some time and they begin to unfurl into minerally billows of slate and citrus. This shows the crisp, tight structure of the Saar—it's a tightly coiled spring of green apple and citrus fruits around a core of minerality. Should age through 2015.",Riesling
Germany,"A pure expression of Mosel Riesling, with touches of flowershop greens, apple and lime. It's sweet but amply structured, with a core of crisp, juicy fruit and a long finish that echoes hints of honey and slate.",Riesling
Germany,"Right now the aromas are a bit tight—even steely—with just modest hints of apple and lime, but the fruit comes to the fore on the palate, exploding with baked apple and spice flavors, balanced by zippy acids. Best from 2011–2015.",Riesling
Germany,"Knyphausen's 2007 Erstes Gewächs wines from Erbach make a stunning couple. The Marcobrunn comes across as slightly cooler, not quite as rich or dense as the Steinmorgen, but possible more elegant. The apple, melon, citrus and mineral notes are delicately interwoven on the long, classy finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Here's a racy Riesling that won't break your budget. Has everything you look for: pretty apple, peach, and honey aromas, with a distinct trace of sun-warmed slate, and long, rich, fruity, flowery flavors. Just a bit off-dry, it's balanced with crisp acidity.",Riesling
Germany,"Floral elements mark the nose, while the flavors of melon and vanilla also carry some slate-like minerality. It's plump and creamy without being overdone, finishing with a touch of spice.",Riesling
Germany,"Lighter in body and sweeter-tasting than the Abstberg Auslese #70, the regular auslese is almost delicate by comparison, featuring slatey, minerally notes to go alongside hints of honey, lime and orange. Finishes long and citrusy, with a dry mineral edge to help balance the sweetness.",Riesling
Germany,"Plump and rounded rather than racy. Some slightly dieselly aromas bring complexity to the mix of melon, spice and slate, while the mineral-laden finish lingers.",Riesling
Germany,"A succulent style that should have enormous appeal. Honey, pineapple and melon aromas and flavors show off Riesling's fruity side, but the wine's minerality keeps it from seeming overly simple.",Riesling
Germany,"A stunningly rich yet balanced dessert wine, this beauty starts with hints of paraffin and almonds, then unleashes waves of sweet dried-apricot and orange-marmalade flavors. Despite the intense, honeyed sweetness, there's enough lime-like acidity to prevent it from being cloying. This tour de force should age effortlessly for 40 or more years.",Riesling
Germany,"This is wonderfully exotic on the nose, blasting forth with waves of mango and peach, then settles down a bit on the palate, where the flavors are of honeyed peaches, dripping with nectar, framed by just enough citrus for balance. Moderately rich, with a long, squeaky-clean finish. Drink now–2025 or beyond.",Riesling
Germany,"Loosen excelled in 2005, and this beerenauslese is no exception. Brilliantly pure scents of pineapple and honey zoom from the glass, then turn lush and voluptuous on the palate, adding alluring hints of peaches and baked apple. Rich and viscous, it lingers on the finish like wildflower honey.",Riesling
Germany,"Strongly marked by rather stinky aromas at first, this wine reveals its full majesty on the palate, where it's lush and round without being soft, filled with baked apple, vanilla, honey and spice notes balanced by ripe acidity. Layered and long on the finish, where it reveals more complexity with every sip. Give it a vigorous decanting if you open a bottle now, or wait 10–20 years, maybe longer.",Riesling
Germany,"Wonderfully balanced and fine, with classic honey, bergamot and dried pineapple aromas that aren't overpowering. This is on the elegant side, blending sweet honey and candied pineapple flavors with zesty citrus fruit for balance. Exquisitely long on the finish, where the balance and elegance become even more apparent. Drink now–2030.",Riesling
Germany,"At 9.5% alcohol and with plenty of residual sugar, this is rather broad, but it still boasts excellent intensity and complexity. Aromas of wet slate speak to the wine's origins, mixing easily with hints of clover leaf, apple, melon and lime. Ends citrusy, but also on a slightly chalky note.",Riesling
Germany,"A terrific value, this may be the best-priced top-quality auslese on the market. From a site that produced several other gems this vintage, this is a lush, slightly viscous wine that boasts scents of apricots, honey and crushed stone, while the flavors feature a beautifully harmonious interplay of stone fruits and ripe citrus. Long and balanced on the finish, with at least a decade or two or evolution ahead.",Riesling
Germany,"Rich, lush and slightly oily in texture, this may lack the exotic notes of the goldkap bottling, but it's still an exceptional wine. Dried apricot notes provide sweetness and flavor, balanced by ripe citrus and a slightly pithy note on the long finish. Drink now–2020.",Riesling
Germany,"A creamy-textured, medium-bodied kabinett, Haart's 2007 features some leesy complexity upfront, then focused pineapple fruit on the midpalate. Finishes long, with citrus and mineral underpinnings that balance the wine's delicate sweetness. Now-2015.",Riesling
Germany,"Intrigues on the nose, offering tantalizing hints of smoke, nuts and honey. But this wine is thick and sweet, and it clings to the sides of the glass, defying attempts to shake it out afterwards. The gooey marmalade flavors finish long and sticky.",Riesling
Germany,"A decent value in sparkling wine, with pronounced yeasty notes and some green apple flavors delivered via a creamy, medium-bodied wine. Labeled trocken, but tastes slightly off-dry.",Sparkling Blend
Germany,"With its delicate aromas of flowers, fresh greens and a hint of mint, you might expect this to be a light, delicate wine. But it's broad and rather sweet, marked by flavors of ripe apples and vanilla. It comes across a bit soft on the finish, but luscious.",Riesling
Germany,"An affordable BA, presumably from a variety of vineyard sites, this is relatively light in body, but it's still a sweet little wine. Fresh apple and citrus aromas and flavors fold in touches of cinnamon, finishing clean and fresh. The bright acidity suggests this may work best as a foil for foie gras or cheeses rather than as a true dessert wine.",Riesling
Germany,"Crisp and clean, with a long, delicately wrought finish, this is a throwback to the auslesen of earlier times, without heaps of sweetness, but instead playing off the fine balance between sugar and acid. Floral and citrus aromas weave around a core of green apple fruit, while a bass line of slatey minerality underscores the melody.",Riesling
Germany,"Big and full-bodied, with just a touch of sugar in evidence, while the alcohol is up to 13%. Petrol and slate notes mark the nose, while the fruit features pineapple, nectarine and melon. Long, powerful and citrusy on the finish, with underlying minerality and spice that provides fascinating complexity. Great now, but there's no reason this shouldn't age well for five or more years.",Riesling
Germany,"Clean and freshly fruity, with apple and citrus aromas and flavors leading the way. This is clearly off-dry, but not cloying, instead coming across as soft and easy.",Riesling
Germany,"At 13.5% alcohol, this is pretty ripe Riesling, broad in the mouth and almost oily in texture. Hints of honey and ripe pear mark the nose, but this wine is more about minerally extract than fruit. Turns spicy on the mouthcoating finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Reasonably priced, this fruit-bowl auslese boasts hints of dried apricot, heaps of ultraripe stone fruit and just enough citrusy notes for balance. It's a more classic vintage, so not as rich or unctuous as the 2003s or 2005s, but leaner and more focused, with a balanced, fresh finish. Drink now–2020.",Riesling
Germany,"Presents an admirable blend of melon, lime, slate, mint and petrol, folding in apple notes on the palate. This is fairly sweet—close to unctuous—in style, while remaining fresh and fruit-driven from start to finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This plump, sweet auslese epitomizes the Pauly Bergweiler style. Honeydew and orange aromas and flavors are ripe and succulent—delicious in an easygoing way—but lack the complexity and extra sizzle to make the wine truly special.",Riesling
Germany,"Honeyed and viscous—this practically pours like syrup—this is a rich dessert wine, filled with flavors of dried apricots and ultraripe peaches. It's long and sugary on the finish, just lacks a bit of acid balance, and while the hints of caramelized nuts may add complexity, they could also be a hint of oxidation. Drink now, in small doses.",Riesling
Germany,"This may seem a bit sweet and heavy next to J.J. Prüm's bottling from the same vineyard, but it's still a darn good wine, with hints of dried apricots to accent pear, melon and spice flavors. It's thick and viscous, with a finish that lingers sweetly. Drink 2013-2020.",Riesling
Germany,"Light and frothy, this isn't quite as vinous as the Chardonnay sekt from Am-Turm. Instead, there's ginger, lime and cilantro aromas and wet-stone and lime flavors that finish clean and dry.",Weissburgunder
Germany,"Pleasantly off-dry, with simple, fruity aromas and flavors reminiscent of apple and citrus. A solid choice for an outdoor gathering this summer.",White Blend
Germany,"Willi Haag's 2007 spätlese from the Juffer boasts a high-class mélange of petrol and slate, flowers and citrus. It's medium in body, with surprisingly restrained fruit on the palate, finishing with just a touch of phenolic bitterness.",Riesling
Germany,"Released in the U.S. a bit later than most German wines, Raimund Prüm's 2006 Würzgarten kabinett remains primary and fresh, filling the room with aromas of green apple, lime and slate. It's medium in body (9% alcohol) and slightly creamy in texture, with an off-dry finish marked by hints of lime zest.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts off slowly, with sulfurous notes that blow off in under an hour to reveal a soft, gentle sekt with mineral and ripe apple flavors.",Riesling
Germany,"Kicks off with intensely petrol-like aromas and hints of vegetable oil rather than overt fruitiness, then develops flavors of honey, marmalade and spice on the palate. It's a rich, viscous wine that finishes very sweet—almost cloying—on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This delectable kabinett starts off with amazingly pure scents of crushed stone, lime and apple, then follows up with flavors of strawberries to go with more apples and limes. It's medium-bodied, slightly sweet but with the crispness to balance its sugars. Finishes pristine and fresh. Drink now-2016.",Riesling
Germany,"There's a slight hint of mushroominess to this wine's aromas, but otherwise it's rather clean, featuring apricot and candied orange aromas and flavors. Offers plenty of depth without being syrupy, ending with a pithy note to help balance the sweetness. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Intensely sweet, as you might expect, with scents of honey, dried apricots and clover. But there's also a hint of vinyl or plastic that mars the nose and the palate, so although this is sticky and long on the finish, it doesn't quite make top marks.",Riesling
Germany,"A strongly minerally wine, the 2005 Maria v. O. boasts perfumes of heating oil and smoke, while the flavors are of apple, pear and citrus, all wrapped in a petrolly shroud. Yet for all that, it also features sweetness balanced by lime-like acid and a clean, refreshing finish. Drink now–2015.",Riesling
Germany,"Tart and very dry, this sparkler appears cleanly made, just somewhat meagrely endowed. Monochromatic—and that's a sour shade of citrus.",Riesling
Germany,"Perfumy on the nose, with scents of lilacs and bubble gum. Light and frothy on the palate, offering soft, slightly sweet flavors reminscent of cotton candy.",Pinot Noir
Germany,"A bit heavy and sweet, with modest pear and melon ¬flavors that fall flat.",Sparkling Blend
Germany,"This plump, medium-bodied kabinett seems destined for early maturity, as it relies on a touch of unreleased CO2 to give it liveliness. Drink it young while it's still fresh, and before the bold apple, pear and citrus flavors fade.",Riesling
Germany,"This is a knockout, from the floral and apricot-laced aromas right through the lingering notes of honey and fruit. It's rich and unctuous on the palate, balancing its considerable residual sugar with only 7% alcohol and crisp, mouthwatering acids. Blends a mélange of fruit—apricots, peaches, pears and apples—with nuances of spice and mineral that no other country in the wine-producing world has yet matched. Like many top German Rieslings, you can drink this now, or enjoy it 20 years from now, and it should last well beyond that. Imported by Classical Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"Intensely diesel-like on the nose, almost to the point of nuttiness, then full-bodied, broad and muscular on the palate, delivering flavors of oranges and wet stones. It's drier than many spätlesen, and while it may lack a bit of raciness and elgance, it makes up for it with sheer power.",Riesling
Germany,"This seems a bit simple and confected for an Erstes Gewächs offering, with superripe, fruity aromas and flavors of apple, melon and lime. It's still a nice wine, medium-bodied and cleanly made, just lacking the minerality and complexity you'd hope for at this level.",Riesling
Germany,"Citrus and green apple flavors mark this rather light-bodied auslese. It's crisp, clean and fresh, with tart lemon-lime flavors on the finish and some modestly minerally undercurrents. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Light to medium in body, this is a clean, fresh auslese, not a big, sugary blockbuster. Pineapple and honey aromas lead the way, adding green apple, mint and citrus flavors as the wine crosses the palate. To some, it may seem a bit green and underripe despite the ample residual sugar, while to others it will a welcome respite from many of the overripe ausleses that are actually declassified BAs.",Riesling
Germany,"Ultraripe tropical fruits—even including hints of bananas—dominate this wine's heady aromas. Acids are soft, and alcohol fairly elevated—12.5%—for a wine of this prädikat. There's ample concentration, and the peach and melon flavors linger on the finish. Drink now–2016.",Riesling
Germany,"A bit reticent on the nose, but hints of honeyed fruit and powdered stone emerge after some coaxing. In the mouth, the flavors explode into strident notes of green apple, honey and lime zest, carried easily by only 8% alcohol. Long, tart and refreshing on the finish; a wine that can be consumed in its exuberant youth or aged into something more refined and complex. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts slow, gradually ramping up its complexity and concentration as it warms in the glass, eventually opening up to show scents of diesel and peach pit alongside flavors of lime, peach and melon. Throughout, there's a strong sensation of minerality, ending on a crisp, mouthwatering note. Imported by Classical Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"This is a decidedly nonfruity Riesling, marked instead by aromas of petrol and featuring flavors of crushed stone, canola oil and lime. It's relatively light in body and close to dry, finishing long and citrusy. Try it with a seafood salad or smoked trout.",Riesling
Germany,"A nicely balanced auslese that's not too rich or sweet, marrying ripe apples and pears with floral notes, tropical fruit and a healthy dose of crushed-stone minerality. Finishes with flourishes of pineapple and citrus. Imported by Classical Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"Even if it's a bit weighty, this Riesling remains balanced, thanks to intense minerality and crisp acids. Apricot and peach scents on the nose mingle with wet stones and hints of cinnamon, turning slightly oily and viscous on the palate. Finishes dry and clean. Imported by Classical Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"Ripe apples meet oily terpenes in this medium-bodied spätlese. Baked apple and sweet melon notes pick up hints of spice and kerosene on the palate, finishing long and clean. Imported by Chapin Cellars.",Riesling
Germany,"Befitting its namesake Würzgarten vineyard, this wine starts off with musky-spicy notes layered over ripe pear and apple fruit and smoky, slate-driven aromas. It's light in body, yet it doesn't lack for strength or intensity at all, finishing long, with cleansing, lime-like acids. Imported by Loosen Bros. USA.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts off a little sluggish, offering up hints of roasted sweet corn on the nose, but those aromas soon give way to scents of pineapple and dried apples. It's soft in the mouth, verging on flabby, but has some charming flavors of apple and spiced pear that make it enjoyable as a chilled apéritif. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Honeyed apples and pears mark the nose of this sweet but balanced auslese. Tasting it reveals hints of dried apricots, cool mint and an earthy minerality, all tied up in a clean, crisp finish. Imported by Chapin Cellars.",Riesling
Germany,"Light and fresh, this spritely kabinett won't bowl you over, but it just may charm you off your feet. Scents of lime and fresh greens lead the charge, backed by crisp apple and citrus flavors. Lively and mouthwatering on the finish. Imported by Chapin Cellars.",Riesling
Germany,"Light and fresh, this tart, strident wine is a poster-child for cool-climate Riesling. Lime, green apple and pineapple aromas and flavors are bold and crisp, tinged with enough slatey minerality to mark its Saar origins. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Unique and idiosyncratic, this extravagantly priced wine certainly makes a statement. Smoky, mineral and spice scents are layered over tropical fruits that range from mango to lychee. Clean and crisp on the finish, without the same length as Bürklin-Wolf's Deidesheimer Hohenmorgen. Imported by Classical Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"A soft, easygoing Riesling that's a nice introduction to the sterner stuff of the Rheingau, this medium-bodied wine offers mouthfilling baked apple and spice flavors to match its broad melon, spice and mineral aromas. Imported by Schmitt-Sohne Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts off with sulfury notes reminiscent of burnt matchstick; slightly rubbery. But with airing, subtle citrus and floral notes emerge, unfolding into baked apple, pear and melon flavors on the palate. This shows balance, elegance and finesse on the crisp, long finish—just give it some time in a decanter if you're going to be drinking it soon. Imported by Chapin Cellars.",Riesling
Germany,"A bit straightforward and simple for what we've come to expect from this producer, with wet slate and honeyed pear aromas that add apple flavors on the palate. It's still very good Riesling, medium-bodied and clean on the finish. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"An interesting, characterful kabinett, with scents of smoke and scorched oil that mingle with lime and apple notes. On the palate, it delivers plenty of zippy citrus flavors, wrapped in a confounding veil of smoke and tar. Might prove better in time; give it 3–4 years of cellaring.",Riesling
Germany,"This slate selection from Kendermanns is a pleasant surprise, speaking of its origins in the smoky, wet slate aromas and stony flavors couched in layers of white peach, melon and hints of honey. Despite a considerable 12.5% alcohol, it seems light and fresh, ending on notes of citrus and melon. Imported by Reh Kendermann GmbH Weinkellerei.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine boasts intense and pure aromas of pear and pineapple, then adds notes of melon and dried spices on the palate. Medium in body and slightly sweet, with a short, crisp finish. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"This fresh, medium-bodied Riesling is clean and fruity, combining flavors of ripe pears and white peaches with hints of apple and slate. Imported by Classical Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"On first glance, this wine comes across as too simple and sweet. But give it some time and a spicy, slatey-minerally compenent emerges, providing balance and complexity to the ripe pear flavors. An estate that seems to be undergoing a bit of a resurgence. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Round and medium-bodied, this relatively low-acid Riesling is soft and easy to drink. Mineral and spice notes accent ripe pear and melon flavors. Drink now. Imported by Loosen Bros. USA.",Riesling
Germany,"Medium in body—and even a bit oily in texture—this amply ripened wine boasts smoky, pungent aromas that veer toward green apple and lime after some airing. It's a bit heavy, but flavorful. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Founded in 1794, Deinhard is an old merchant house—what the French would call a négociant—that markets a wide array of wines. The company's 1808 price list offered 89 different Rhine and Mosel wines, but that's been at least somewhat shortened in recent years. No, it's not that intense, nor does it show a lot of minerality, but this wine ably shows off Mosel Riesling's array of fruity, off-dry flavors, ranging from peach and pear to apple, pineapple and lime. Crisp and clean on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Lacks the layered intensity that the 2003 version of this wine showed at this stage, but still delivers stony, minerally aromas and prototypical flavors of green apples and fresh limes. Light in body, but clean and wonderfuly refreshing on the finish. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Relatively light in weight for the Rheingau, with modest pineapple and fern aromas on the nose. Tart and flavorful on the palate, marrying pineapple and green apple flavors that finish crisp and dry. Imported by Schmitt-Sohne Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Breuer's entry-level wine isn't cheap, but it's also pretty good, marrying stony, minty scents with flavors of lime, fresh herbs and wet stones. It's light in body for such an alcoholic Rheingau Riesling, with a clean, fresh finish. Imported by Classical Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"Still a bit sulfury, but otherwise correct, with melon, pear and spice flavors, lithe body and a clean, short finish. Should be better in another year or two. Imported by Palm Bay Imports.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts with slate and lime aromas, adding in modest apple notes on the medium-weight palate. Clean and crisp, just lacks a bit of distinction. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Light and very crisp, this wine even boasts hints of retained carbon dioxide to further enliven its mouthfeel. Lime and flint-smoke scents yield to citrusy, stony flavors. Would work well as an apéritif. Imported by Classical Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"Seems slightly disjointed, with pungent diesel aromas on one hand and sweet-tart melon and pear flavors on the other. It's atypically broad in the mouth for Riesling, almost fat, yet closes on a tangy, earthy note. Imported by Schmitt-Sohne Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Make no mistake—this is full-bodied, but it carries its 14.5% alcohol without any sign of warmth, just mouthcoating layers of flavor. Petrol and oily notes mark the nose and palate, but there's enough apple-y fruit and dried-spice notes to achieve complexity and balance. Dry essence of Riesling.",Riesling
Germany,"A soft, fruity wine, Knyphausen's entry-level Riesling has hints of flowers on the nose, then delivers weighty pear and melon flavors. Off-dry. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"The fruit seems rather restrained in this medium-bodied Riesling. Instead, the emphasis is on slatey, minerally scents, backed by soft apple and citrus flavors. Imported by Chapin Cellars.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine lacks the richness and texture of Knipser's Im Großen Garten bottling, but more than makes up for it with complex notes of spring flowers, bergamot, spice and mineral. Long and crisp on the finish, with potential to possibly improve up to 10 years.",Riesling
Germany,"Strikes a lovely balance between fruit and minerality, marrying ripe apple and orangey citrus notes with hints of petrol or diesel. Reasonably full-bodied, turning crisp and zesty on the spice-inflected finish. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Reasonably priced for a Riesling of this quality, this off-dry wine is filled with spiced baked apple flavors. Touches of petrol and stone dust impart a sense of minerality, while the finish is long and mouthwatering.",Riesling
Germany,"Like all of the Weil wines, even this entry-level effort places an emphasis on ripeness. Hints of smoke and diesel add complexity to the nose, while on the palate it's broad and slightly off-dry, with sun-drenched flavors of nectarine and melon that coat the mouth on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Full-bodied and rich, even a little oily in texture, this is a big mouthful of Riesling, yet it's spicy and floral, making for an elegant presentation. Drink it now to make the most of its intricate bouquet.",Riesling
Germany,"Although the aromas of this wine are largely neutral, showing just hints of apple and citrus, the flavors come alive on the palate, offering up ripe apple, lime, nectarine and spice notes. It's slightly oily in texture, finishing softly tart, accented by dried spices.",Riesling
Germany,"Lime, honey and slate aromas mingle easily on the nose of this medium-bodied Riesling, while the flavors show hints of melon rind and plenty of peppery spice. Finshes crisp, with zesty acids balancing a touch of sweetness. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Rather full and round in the mouth—the combined effect of 12.5% alcohol and a touch (0.6%) of residual sugar—this nevertheless does taste pretty dry. It's a minerally version, with smoky minerality and powdered—almost liquified—stone notes fleshed out by hints of tangerine and peach. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Off-dry, as expected from a halbtrocken, marrying stony, underripe peach notes with hints of oil and honey. The combination of sugar and tartness gives it a tangy finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This is a crisp, tongue-tingling Riesling. It starts with scents of oiled apples, but quickly turns lemony, racing across the palate with zesty acids.",Riesling
Germany,"A stunning expression of place, very mineral but with enough juicy stone fruit nuances to be immediately likeable. It's tight and focused, showing excellent balance and a long, perfumed finish. Drink now (think sushi) or stash away for five or more years for a more laid-back style.",Riesling
Germany,"Truly stunning, this white starts out with subtle talcum powder and gravel notes, then adds intense perfume and peaches in the mouth. There's a finely tuned balance and good length. Exceptional harmony and intensity suggest it will improve for 15 years or more.",Riesling
Germany,"Although this wine boasts a viscous, slightly oily texture, the aromas and flavors are somewhat stony and unyielding. Hints of apple, peach and spice finish with a hard edge.",Riesling
Germany,"Reasonably plump in the mouth and maybe even showing a touch of sweetness, this is a clean, well-crafted Riesling with straightforward green apple and citrus flavors. A squirt of lime gives the finish a tangy quality. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,This wine is a shining example of the glorious minerality that singles out Mosel Riesling. The nose shows really appealing pear and gardenia scents overlaying wet stone notes. The mouthwatering acidity wakes up your palate and is in perfect balance with the substantial residual sugar. Drink now (with sushi) or hold five or more years for even more complexity.,Riesling
Germany,"A medium-bodied dry Riesling, this offers rather simple, fruity flavors of apple and pineapple. Although it lacks a great deal of complexity, it's well-balanced and harmonious; easy to drink.",Riesling
Germany,"An expressive, extroverted style that still communicates a sense of place. There's loads of dried fruit character here, with apple, nectarine, rose and graham flour flavors that build to a long-lasting finish. Light-bodied, with a spice aftertaste. Drink now or hold five-plus years.",Riesling
Germany,"Serious and earthy, like walking into a wall of minerality. The fruit takes a back seat here, but is lusciously peachy and fresh while the long finish is sparked by hints of exotic spices. Give this two to three years to show its best.",Riesling
Germany,"The ‘goldkap,' or ‘gold capsule,' in this wine's designation indicates a riper cuvée than the producer's ordinary spätlese. As expected, the fruit is exuberant and lush with hints of tinned apricots and peach jam. An underlying note of lemon zest enlivens the palate and carries over to the long, flowery finish. There's lots of sweetness here; consider serving on its own.",Riesling
Germany,"A mixture of mineral and spice accompanies the lemon and apricot fruit in this tangy, focused Riesling. There's plenty of intensity and an energizing balance of fresh acidity and lingering sweetness. Drink now or age four to five years.",Riesling
Germany,"Aromatic, succulent and invigorating, this Riesling is firing on all cylinders. The palate is on the dry side with powerful flavors of honey, ginger and peach that fade to an enticing spice note.",Riesling
Germany,"Despite the “dry” label, this wine boasts sweet-tasting flavors that are fruity and simple, favoring apple and pineapple, then turning tart and citrusy on the finish. Cleanly made.",Riesling
Germany,"A classic Mosel Kabinett that displays the concentration and pure, expressive fruit typical of the great 2008 vintage. There's loads of Asian spice, apple and gardenia on the nose, while a citrus top note come through on the palate. Finishes long, with a lingering mineral edge. Will improve over the next decade or more though it's drinking well now.",Riesling
Germany,"There's a lot going on here, with petroleum, musk, orange flower and clove scents on the nose while the palate is as light as a feather, with mouthwatering acidity and a zippy, cinnamon-infused finish. Drink now or hold several years for more complexity.",Riesling
Germany,"Very impressive, with a mineral backdrop setting the stage for a powerful expression of apricot and pear fruit. The mouthwatering acidity masks a fair amount of residual sugar, resulting in a lingering finish that seems dry. Drink now or hold for several years for a more nuanced expression.",Riesling
Germany,"Give this wine some air before you serve it in order to appreciate the entire range of its dense aromatics, which flow from delicate tangerine, to peach and on into the mineral end of the spectrum. The palate is juicy, with an energizing tension between the nervy acidity and delicate sweetness. Finishes long, with a slate undertow. Try with cod in a miso sauce.",Riesling
Germany,"Concentrated and balanced, with high residual sugar and lip-smacking acidity propping up elegant white flower notes. The long, clean, finish shows pretty green apple inflections. Drink now or cellar two to three years.",Riesling
Germany,"A different aromatic profile here, with bread dough and wet grass scents dominating the nose. It's well structured, with good flowery intensity in the mouth and a weighty, medium-to-long finish. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Soft at first, but the density of the pine, gardenia and spice flavors emerges as the wine opens up while the lingering finish shows excellent purity of fruit. Serve with sushi. Drink now or hold three to four years for more complexity.",Riesling
Germany,"Bone dry but harmonious and well balanced, with ripe acidity and restrained pear, honey and petroleum notes in a medium-bodied frame. Its finish is long and minerally. Drinking well now but will show more finesse several years down the road.",Riesling
Germany,"Crisp and tightly wound, this Baden Pinot has lovely cherry pie and vanilla scents folding in to leather and mixed berry flavors on the palate. Long, slightly tart finish of saddle leather. Drink now to 2013.",Pinot Noir
Germany,"Here's a good value in the world of Spätlese, with a clean, pretty nose of talcum powder and baby's breath. There's nice mineral intensity and an off-dry, mouth-puckering finish. This easy-to-like wine would be a good choice to serve as an apéritif to a crowd.",Riesling
Germany,"Very spicy, with candied orange peel and sour drop notes undercut by a lower honey-botrytis element. Appealing, if lacking the purity of the best from this hallowed vineyard. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"This is a zippy little number, with scents of white cherries and citrus that float over a bed of petroleum and fresia. The crisp, off-dry finish winds down to a lingering grapefruit note. Drink now with cod in a miso sauce or stash away for a few years.",Riesling
Germany,"Like drinking a fruit cocktail. This exceptionally pretty white is succulent and balanced, with good depth and penetrating flower notes. The broad, medium-length finish is dominated by ripe cantaloupe and green apple notes. Drink now or hold a few years.",Riesling
Germany,"Generous, with a distinct pine character and tangy passion fruit flavors framing the medium-bodied palate. Exotic, medium finish of curry leaf and lemon curd. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine overdelivers for its pale garnet color. There's loads of sweet cherry fruit along with mocha and caramel character, all set in a bed of soft tannins. A long finish trails off to an extended earth note. Try with leg of lamb. Fully mature, drink up in the next year or two.",Pinot Noir
Germany,"A less fruity take, with mineral and kerosene dominating the nose and a wet slate thread running through the exquisitely crisp palate. Spring flowers and honey notes soften up the finish. Try with Thai noodles.",Riesling
Germany,"On the subtle side for a Mosel Riesling, with shy aromas of melon and peach and a stony character in the mouth. This one is likely to be more expressive after a few years in the cellar.",Riesling
Germany,"Kerner is a variety not often seen in the U.S., although it is among the top five most planted white grapes in Germany. It's a cross between Trollinger (a red grape) and Riesling, making for—in this case—a pretty, aromatic white with hints of muskmelon, tropical fruit, maybe even some red berries, all on a light frame. Long and refreshing on the finish.",Kerner
Germany,"A bit fuller and drier than you might expect from a Mosel Riesling, but there's no questioning this wine's excellent balance. Honey and cinnamon notes accent pear and melon fruit, while hints of petrol lurk in the background. It's almost dry on the long finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Boasts classic Mosel Riesling aromas and flavors—lime, pineapple, green apple, maybe a touch of honey—all at an eminently reasonable price. Though richer and creamier than you might expect, the weight is balanced by crisp acidity on the long finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Round and plush, this relatively high-alcohol (13%) Mosel Riesling offers plenty of ripe fruit flavors, yet finishes dry. A smoky, leesy character on the nose wraps easily around a core of pineapple and peach fruit. Drink now.",Riesling

Germany,"Hochgewächs suggests an extra level of quality, and this is good, especially for one from the oft-maligned Zeller Schwarze Katz. Starts off a bit leesy on the nose, but offers pleasant flavors of white peaches, melon and spice before coming to a slightly attenuated close.",Riesling
Germany,"Smoky, intense and petrolly on the nose, this medium-bodied Riesling goes 180 degrees on the palate, where the flavors are the more typical apple and lemon-lime. It's a touch oily, finishing with a tangy, citrusy edge.",Riesling
Germany,"Full and soft for a Riesling, with appealing aromas of corn oil, ripe apples, pears and limes and flavors of minerals and spice. Attractive, but lacks a bit of vibrancy and zest on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Medium-bodied and round in the mouth, this is readily approachable Riesling with slightly smoky aromas of diesel fuel and corn oil. Orange zest and spice flavors flesh out the package, finishing a bit soft.",Riesling
Germany,"Soft and round in the mouth, this is rather alcoholic for a Mosel (12%), but carries it well, balancing the weight with flinty, citrusy aromas and flavors that fall off rapidly on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Fruity, packed with berry and melon aromas and flavors that end up coming across as slightly confected, with a slightly syrupy texture in the mouth.",Riesling
Germany,"Plump and sweet, this is a bit soft and lacking structure, although the ripe apple and pear flavors do offer plenty of immediate attraction. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"A bit leaner in style than the 2005—as you might expect—with attractive aromas of pineapple and fresh greens giving way to flavors of honey, spice and melon. The fruit drops away on the finish, leaving tart acids to linger.",Riesling
Germany,"Understated on the nose, but there are some pretty hints of melon, spice and crushed stone. Light in body, with modest fruit flavors on the palate, but some finishing anise and clove.",Riesling
Germany,"As expected, this vintage is not as interesting as the 2005, but it still remains a decent Riesling. It's fresh and minerally, with lime zest and pineapple flavors that finish tart and refreshing.",Riesling
Germany,"Simple but fresh and appealing, this offering—made in conjunction with Washington State's Chateau Ste. Michelle—is a light, entry-level Ries ling filled with green apple and citrus flavors. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Light and fresh, with citrusy flavors dressed up by flowershop greens and a touch of dusty chalk. Finishes with a hint of ripe apple.",Riesling

Germany,"Spice and lanolin notes are curious and enticing on the nose and palate of this sunny and sweet, but impeccably balanced Riesling. Juicy, supple, apple jelly and quince flavors are offset by striking acidity and steely minerality that reverberate on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This is intriguingly scented stuff, with hints of honey, musk and truffles that come together harmoniously. The flavors run along similar veins, being complex and sweet without being obviously fruity; this is not a dry wine (28.9 g/L residual sugar). Finishes a bit soft; drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Everything about this Riesling is elegant and balanced: Sweet-tasting, honeyed fruit and flower elements are countered by smoke and savory fennel notes. Rich, creamy textures are enlivened by a shock of lemon-lime acidity. Juicy yet refined, it lingers long with a kiss of sweet nectarine flavor.",Riesling
Germany,"Steely and smoky, this luscious, full-bodied wine has a gorgeous mineral tone. The palate is dry, yet decadently fruity and floral, with loads of dainty blossoms and yellow cherries. A rich, nuanced, impeccably balanced wine.",Riesling
Germany,"Dark, mysterious aromas of smoke, petrol and brine are enticing on the nose. Semisweet in style, with an abundance of honeyed stone-fruit and citrus flavors, this wine shows glimmers of maturity already, but it's structured enough to improve for at least 7–10 more years.",Riesling

Germany,"Sweet, lush and harmonious, with almost decadent honey, apple and citrus flavors balanced by scents of crushed stone and just enough acidity to keep things vibrant.",Riesling

Germany,"Thirty bucks may seem like a lot for an entry-level Riesling, but this is an exemplary example. Aromas of wet stones, moss and spring flowers are mouthwatering, and then are followed by a complex array of nonfruity flavors, like stones and greens carried along by a mouthfeel that's light as a feather. Tart pineapple emerges on the long finish. Drink anytime over the next 10 years.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine's calling card is its electric acidity, which provides a poignant counterbalance to the wine's plump feel on the palate. Ripe citrus notes of pineapple and orange offer plenty of flavor to go along with the superb length. It's ready to drink, yet should prove capable of aging at least 5–6 years.",Riesling

Bristling with acidity and a delicate layer of tannins, it's delicately structured but elegantly fruity, with hints of dried cherry and plum accented by rose and potpourri notes.",Spätburgunder
Germany,"Perhaps because of its slow, natural fermentation in large casks and the resulting lees contact, this wine shows a bit of toasty, mealy character and a slightly creamy texture. It's a weighty Riesling (for the Mosel, anyway), with ripe notes of peach complementing citrus fruit and a dry, stony finish.",Riesling

Germany,"Pale lemon in color. Restrained at first and quite reduced, but opens up in the glass to show appealing citrus and white peach aromas. Crisp and juicy, with citrus flavors predominating—tangerine, ruby red grapefruit and meyer lemon. Medium sweet, refreshing but slightly short on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"To judge by its nose, this medium-bodied Riesling is quiet and introverted. And the flavors are also relatively neutral, with a slight earthiness and savory character defining its profile. Has the same lingering beefy-brininess on the finish as the other Liebfruenstift wines, just not as intense.",Riesling
Germany,"This is on the big side for a Mosel Riesling, at 12% alcohol, and the warmth shows through just a little bit. Still, the scents of wet moss and stone and chunky flavors suggesting melon, peach and citrus are undeniably attractive. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"While this is aromatic with scents of ripe apples, nectarines, honey and lanolin, it has a subdued elegance. The dry, medum-bodied palate is crisp and clean, with hints of green herbs and honeycomb that linger.",Riesling
Germany,"There's a brooding quality to the smoky, diesel-fuel like aromas of this wine, but that's left in the rearview by ripe flavors of honey and baked apple once it's in the mouth. This wine is round and atypically soft for the vintage, but picks up some lively lime notes on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"A pretty, vibrant Pinot Noir from southern Germany, featuring strawberry and raspberry fruit, some slightly herbal nuances and a bright, lively finish. Drink now–2013.",Spätburgunder
Germany,"Quite subdued on the nose, with delicate notes of mixed wild berries and a savory earthiness.

Germany,"Candied nose of sweet red currants, cherries and savory herbs. On the palate, this is quite warm, with mild cherry compote, forest floor and earthy flavors. Simple and a little dilute, but easy drinking, with a pleasantly fruity finish.",Rosé
Germany,"Dr. L has developed into the sort of consistent, large-production wine consumers can depend on when faced with an otherwise unknown array of wines. The 2009 is off dry, with crisp acidity, lime and pineapple flavors and a mouthwatering finish. Drink it over the next year or so.",Riesling
Germany,"Mid-gold in color. Earthy, heady, herbal nose with notes of tangy lime marmalade. Sweet, with a creamy, smooth texture. Tangy citrus flavors follow through with hints of resinous herbs. Pleasant and easy-drinking but with only moderate length and an earthy finish",Gewürztraminer
Germany,"Burnt caramel, vanilla and herbaceous dill notes lend an oaky feel to the dainty red-plum and violet flavors. The tannins are finely grained but persistent, extending the long, sour-cherry-flavored finish.",Spätburgunder

Germany,"The entry-level Riesling from this historic estate is a solid, satisfying wine in 2010, offering modest aromas and flavors of citrus fruit and wet stones. It's a medium-weight, almost-dry wine, with a long, crisp finish. Drink now–2017.",Riesling

Germany,"Herbaceous and green, with sprays of brambly wood and flower, this is a delicately structured but vivacious red wine, with an enticing rose-petal aroma.",Pinot Noir
Germany,"Pale gold in color. Slightly sweet and candied aromas prevail: pear drops and white flowers. Similar flavors appear on the fairly light-bodied palate. This is fresh, fruity and easy to drink, but lacking any great depth or flavor intensity. A slight bitter note is noticeable on the finish.",Pinot Gris
Germany,"Pale ruby core with slight garnet rim. Moderately intense earthy aromas, leather, dried cherries and a hint of caramel  draw you in, while the palate is medium-bodied, with a rustic grip to the tannins. Fairly warm and chunky in texture, with flavors of ripe baked red fruits. Crisp acidity helps keep the balance. Slightly hot on the finish.",Pinot Noir
Germany,"A plump, juicy off-dry Riesling, the 2009 from Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler represents a solid value. Hints of diesel mark the nose, while the peach and lime flavors play off one another nicely. Nothing spectacular, just good everyday juice at an excellent price.",Riesling
Germany,"A bit of an anomaly for this fine Ruwer estate, where being merely good is a disappointment. It starts off with attractive stone and ripe apple notes, but seems somewhat  acetic on the palate—there's an intrusive pickle-like note.",Riesling
Germany,"Plump, sweet and creamy in texture, with apple and citrus flavors that offer simple, straightforward pleasure. Good quality, impressive for the 50,000 cases produced.",Riesling
Germany,"Round on the palate for a Riesling, with plumpness and sweetness to the midpalate that's balanced by hints of pink grapefruit and passion fruit and a fresh, clean finish. Patio wine.",Riesling
Germany,"Intensely minerally, with shades of crushed stone and wet gravel, this is a dainty, sweet Riesling, with loads of white peach, honey and sweet tangerine flavors. A hint of dried herb on the midpalate finishes on a slightly craggy, bitter note.",Riesling
Germany,"A note of crushed granite lends a shimmering minerality to the crisp black-plum and berry flavors on this light-footed Pinot Noir. Fresh with a green herb note and bright, brisk acidity, this would pair with delicate fish and fowl dishes.",Spätburgunder
Germany,"Initial waves of charred oak and smoke impose against a delicate backdrop of black cherry and bramble, but fruity and herbaceous green flavors come through nicely on the midpalate, layered with hints of earthy mushrooms and dusty minerals.",Spätburgunder
Germany,"“Feinherb” isn't an officially defined term, but it's generally understood to mean a wine that's slightly drier than might be expected without being fully dry. This is a medium-bodied, slightly sweet wine, with notes of honey and paraffin alongside citrus fruit. Drink it over the next year or two.",Riesling
Germany,"A nicely balanced entry-level Riesling, with hints of stone fruit and wet stone accenting apple and citrus. As a Saar wine should be, it's properly light on its feet, with refreshing acids on the abbreviated finish. Drink now and over the next few years.",Riesling
Germany,"Sweet, rich and soft, this is a nice wine, but in the context of site, producer and vintage, a bit of a disappointment. Honey and clove flavors lack extra dimensions of complexity and focus, finishing without the expected balancing zing of acidity.",Riesling
Germany,"There's a simple nose of tangy orange marmalade on this medium-gold colored wine. Similar flavors follow through on the palate with zingy lime-sherbet notes. Sweet but racy enough to compensate. Still, this is a bit one dimensional and lacking depth of flavor. Pleasant and easy-drinking, with moderate length.",Gewürztraminer
Germany,"An odd bird, this wine is almost pungent, with intense, earthy aromas that carry a nutty edge. It's hugely thick and viscous (and sweet), but the candied orange flavors lack a bit of balancing acidity.",Riesling
Germany,"Admirable quality from a large-volume producer, combining hints of honey, ripe apples and crushed clover leaves. It's on the weighty, sweet side, but balanced by a fine vein of citrus on the finish. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Sweet-tart red cherry and pastry notes are enticing, but the big char and smoke make it hard to focus on the palate's abundance of juicy red-fruit flavors. Fine-grained yet persistent tannins extend the finish. It ends with a delicate spray of violet perfume.",Spätburgunder
Germany,"Abundant layers of char and smoke threaten to overtake the bright black-cherry and green herb flavors on this premium wine. Aeration brings the fruit to the forefront, but hints of toasted wood and dill linger on the finish.",Spätburgunder
Germany,"Light in body despite 12.5% alcohol, this lithe, sinewy Riesling is almost dry in style, with zippy pineapple and citrus fruit tracing a lean path down the palate. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"For only $5, this wine offers lemonade-style refreshment with a kick. It's simple, fruity and direct, with apple and citrus notes that provide a sweet and sour contrast to each other. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"The style at Dr. Pauly-Bergweiler is often quite sweet, and the 2009 Noble House is soft and succulent, marked by ripe apple and peach flavors. Pleasant, if slightly lacking in zip.",Riesling
Germany,"Aromatically subdued, with just a whiff of steely minerality, this easygoing Riesling boasts ripe peach and apricot flavors, accented by hints of spice and crushed stone. The finish is brisk, with vivid lemon-lime acidity.",Riesling
Germany,"Firm tannins and notes of fresh dill and toasted coconut brood against the delicate backdrop of the crisp notes of black-plums and violets. It's an elegant wine, but slight and understated in structure.",Spätburgunder
Germany,"A wine that shows it is possible to make a good Riesling at a reasonable price, the 2010 from Clean Slate offers up basic apple and citrus flavors. Hints of crushed stone and spring flowers elevate it above the ordinary, as does the mouthwatering finish of this off-dry wine. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"A meaty, mushroomy Pinot Noir, this rather expensive bottling from Franken offers decent complexity but lacks vibrancy.",Spätburgunder
Germany,"Slightly feral, with baked fruit notes alongside hints of coffee grounds. Disappointing; lacks freshness.",Spätburgunder
Germany,"Notes of sweet baking spices and ripe, red cherries and plums seem luxurious against the subtly herbaceous green-leaf and dusty mineral notes. The finish is fairly short, but it ends sweetly with a kiss of ripe red fruit.",Spätburgunder
Germany,"This spätlese from the huge Moselland cooperative does a decent job at balancing hints of softly ripe peaches with taut grapefruity elements, all reinforced by a rather sinewy palate feel. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"This soft yet mouthwatering Riesling is plump and medium bodied, with apple, citrus and melon notes finishing clean and correct. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Very earthy aromas of root tubers, roast meat and a hint of strawberry gumdrop. This is medium-bodied, with grippy tannins, and comes across as slightly awkward and warm on the palate, with flavors of jammy red fruit. Fairly simple, with a relatively short warm finish.",Spätburgunder
Germany,"A soft, easy style that should have broad appeal, this modest spätlese marries slightly confected, ripe fruit flavors with more balanced citrusy notes. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"If this wine's aromas don't exactly burst from the glass, that's OK, because the modest citrus notes are clean and fresh, balancing a bit of sweetness against crisp acids. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"The Blue Fish Rieslings are decent efforts from the Niederkirchen cooperative. The 2009 Sweet Riesling features ripe pear and melon balanced by crisp pineapple notes. It's rather soft and sweet, but since that's what it's supposed to be, it's hard to quibble, especially at the price.",Riesling
Germany,"Uncharacteristically earthy and spicy for a Mosel wine, with flavors of loam accented by musky spice notes. It's off dry in style yet relatively broad on the palate, again setting itself apart from the mainstream.",Riesling
Germany,"Light almost to the point of inconsequence, this floral, citrusy Riesling is off dry in style, with modest apple and citrus flavors. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Smells of baby powder, green apple and lime make for a promising start, but this wine turns sweet and a bit flabby on the palate, as the bubble gum and cotton candy flavors are only partially balanced by modest acidity.",Riesling
Germany,"Pale lemon color. There's a slightly resinous nose with strong earthy overtones and hints of citrus. Racy, almost tart and a bit jagged across the palate. Moderate flavor intensity of lemon and grapefruit sherbet. Lacks some flesh, and finishes a touch short.",Riesling
Germany,"From one of Germany's biggest cooperative wineries, this is a pleasant, if somewhat modestly concentrated Riesling. Apple and citrus flavors don't show a ton of complexity, but they're clean and varietally correct, with the sugar balanced by adequate acids. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Riesling's growing popularity has led to a number of recent brand introductions, like this one. It's light in body, with a wiry intensity to its acids and crisp green apple, lime and wet stone notes. Drink it over the next year.",Riesling
Germany,"A medium-bodied, slightly chunky Riesling, this lacks the elegance and finesse of the best Mosel wines, but still manages a tasty balance of sweet and tart, with apple, citrus and earthy notes all combining on the palate.",Riesling
Germany,"It's a bit chunky for a Mosel Riesling, but this wine also offers enough in the way of semisweet lime and pineapple flavors to compensate. There's a hint of struck flint on the nose and a slightly custardy texture. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"The “black cat” Riesling I remember from my childhood rides again, with modest green apple notes accented by bits of earth and citrus. It's off dry and soft, yet with a slightly sour edge to the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Sweet and broad, this eiswein displays a distinctly sour edge to its flavors, which proved offputting to this taster.",Gewürztraminer
Germany,"Musky, spicy and reasonably complex on the nose, this recent entrant into the ranks of realistically priced Riesling is a bit chunky in the mouth, but offers satisfying apple, melon and citrus flavors.",Riesling
Germany,"A respectable effort, Raimund Prüm's 2009 Essence displays fine aromas of honey, citrus and clove blossom. The melon and citrus flavors lack a bit of intensity, yet still finish clean and refreshing. Drink this lightweight wine over the next six months or so.",Riesling
Germany,"The little-known Mosel village of Reil is the source of this perplexing wine. It possesses attractive and slightly stony, citrus aromas, and starts off on the sweet side, with bright pineapple fruit. But somewhere on the palate it shifts gears, turning dry and tart almost to the point of being sour.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts off with aromas of struck flint, heating oil and even some sweaty-sock notes before delivering melon and apple flavors on the palate. Offers decent complexity, but lacks focus and length. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"If the first duty of an icewine is to be sweet, this satisfies that need. Its sugar is also reasonably balanced in this case by 10% alcohol and crisp acids. What's missing is the purity of fruit, as some slightly singed, earthy notes creep into its aromas and finish.",Silvaner
Germany,"A terrific kabinett, Loosen's 2007 WS offers slightly smoky, leesy notes upfront, then adds touches of white peach, pear, vanilla and a trace of cinnamon. It's round and lush on the palate, yet racy at the same time, finishing long and sweet, with a citrusy tinge to the flavors.",Riesling
Germany,"With 3,000 cases imported into the U.S., consumers should still be able to track down some of this sweet, luscious spätlese. Citrus and custard notes mark the nose, followed by rich, tropical elements, even some hints of banana. Despite the sugary richness, the wine ends clean and refreshing, thanks to a burst of lime on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Smells a bit like a shady mountain stream, with mossy notes and wet stones, then just explodes with fruit when you taste it, bursting with apple and citrus flavors. Some CO2 adds extra zip, but this has plenty of acid for balance, finishing zesty and long.",Riesling
Germany,"Shows some characteristic Prüm stinky notes, but there's plenty of fruit lurking underneath. Pear, honey, melon and citrus flavors give an impression of great ripeness, amplified by the creamy texture and custardy mouthfeel, but there's also enough crisp acidity for balance. Drink now–2025, maybe longer.",Riesling
Germany,"Under an initial leesy funk, you'll find ample apple and lime aromas. On the palate, this is a plump, succulent wine, enlivened with a touch of residual CO2 and boasting apple, vanilla and citrus flavors layered over a minerally foundation. Long and creamy-textured on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Classic M-S-R Riesling aromas of slate, green apple and lime lead to flavors that are appropriately stony and minerally, buffered by just enough fruit and sweetness. Light in body, long and racy on the finish. Drink now–2020.",Riesling
Germany,"Has a flinty, minerally edge to the aromas, which are otherwise classic Mosel: green apple with a lemon-lime chaser. It's light, lean, racy and sweet all at once, with a cool stone core and tremendous length and cut on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"An oddball of an eiswein. Bizarre earthy, brothy notes combine with honeyed sweetness to make for an ""interesting"" tasting experience.",White Blend
Germany,"A classic kabinett, being light in body yet rich in intensity, this wine offers up oodles of apple, lime and mineral notes. There's a tinge of honeyed sweetness to the aromas and flavors, but it stays clean and crisp, delicate yet powerful.",Riesling
Germany,"Four 2007 kabinetts from the Sonnenuhr vineyard in one flight, and all scored 90 points or better, including this beauty, which features white peaches, honeysuckle and a squirt of lime to go along with pear and vanilla notes. It's round and lush yet balanced, if somewhat on the rich, sweet side.",Riesling
Germany,"A terrific value in top-flight Riesling, this kabinett is named for a slate common in the middle Mosel and is sourced from a variety of Loosen's estate vineyards. Apple, cinnamon and slate notes are wonderfully interwoven in a wine that's creamy in texture without any accompanying heaviness. Finishes long and vibrant.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts off with some slightly funky, sweaty-socks aromas, but then delivers yellow plum and diesel scents. Flavors run in a similar vein, with yellow and green plum notes nicely balanced by hints of mineral and lees. It's light to medium in body, off-dry, with a long finish featuring finely etched notes of plum and stone.",Riesling
Germany,"Very perfumed and floral, with added scents of lime and strawberry. On the palate, slaty, stony notes and lime flavors balance the considerable sweetness, ending long and stridently tart. The crisp acids give this the backbone to age 10 or more years.",Riesling
Germany,"While many dry wines from the Mosel are overly tart, this offering is a very pleasant exception. It is stony, minerally and a bit austere, offering up the barest hints of peach kernel and spice, but it's also characterful. It finishes with good length, showing firmness alongside dried-spice notes.",Riesling
Germany,"The Mönchhof style tends towards richness and sweetness, and this wine is no exception. That said, it's not overdone, blending the lightness of flower-shop greenery with notes of berry and citrus. Finishes long, with echoes of pineapple and crushed stone.",Riesling
Germany,"A sweet, plump, succulent spätlese, Bastgen's 2007 Auf den Felsen (on the rocks, referring to the section of the vineyard) features scents of aloe and lime, followed by apple and citrus flavors surrounding a mineral core. Mouthwatering on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"A medium-bodied, dry Silvaner, with modestly earthy, minerally and grapefruity aromas and citrus and mineral flavors. It finishes clean and fresh, with only 11% alcohol. Serve as an apéritif, alone or with passed hors d'oeuvres.",Silvaner
Germany,"This plump, medium-bodied kabinett features scents of pineapple, ginger, cinnamon and slate, while the bold flavors of citrus and spice are tempered by minerality and a touch of pithiness.",Riesling
Germany,"Like many of the J.J. Prüm wines, this one starts off funky smelling, with hints of sweaty socks. But those aromas aren't enough to conceal the underlying notes of apple, citrus and vanilla; decant the wine if you intend to drink it during the next five years or so. It's plump and custardy in texture, with a long, pineappley finish.",Riesling
Germany,"A terrific value, Von Hövel's basic Riesling offers consumers a chance to taste the mineral nature of the Saar's terroir. Notes of slate are almost smoky in their intensity, while the fruit is vibrant and laser-etched in its precision. The apple and lime flavors are delivered aboard a creamy-textured palate, balanced by crisp acids on the off-dry finish.",Riesling
Germany,"The Gräflich von Hohenthal'Scher wines are remarkably well priced for single-vineyard offerings. The 2007 Zeltinger Himmelreich offers bold scents of wet stone, pineapple and melon, turning honeyed and tropical on the palate. It's sweet and lush, perfect for near-term consumption with mildly spicy Asian cuisine.",Riesling
Germany,"Soft and sweetly ripe, this medium-bodied Riesling features touches of peach, adding richness to its apple and citrus flavors. Hints of petrol and lime join in on the finish. Drink now–2012.",Riesling
Germany,"Seems almost confectionary in its bold, fruit-driven aromas of spring flowers, strawberries and lime, but picks up greater minerality and some petrol notes on the slightly creamy-texture palate. Long and fruit-driven on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Raumland's Marie-Luise is a blanc de noirs of 100% Pinot Noir that comes across as toasty and nutty on the nose and palate, without obvious red-berry fruitiness or the earthy, sous-bois complexity of the variety. That said, it is medium in body and does make for a nice glass of bottle-matured sparkling.",Sparkling Blend
Germany,"Supersweet and cloying, with one-dimensional honey and barley-sugar aromas and flavors. Disappointing.",Riesling
Germany,"Despite being essentially an entry-level wine, this is not simple fruity-sweet Riesling. Instead, it offers aromas of slate, citrus and an almost fumé-like smoky character, mostly dry, minerally, stony flavors and a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now–2012.",Riesling
Germany,"Superstar Egon Müller has at least kept his basic Riesling at an affordable level. At first, it's almost odorless, but give it a chance to develop in the glass and delicate apple, fern and lime notes emerge. A hint of CO2 adds to the impression of lightness, and the wine finishes crisp, racy and clean. A finesse-filled wine likely best in its youth.",Riesling
Germany,"Distinctively oily and petrol-like in aroma, with hints of peaches and minerals. Even the texture is slightly oily, yet this medium-bodied wine finishes clean and fresh.",Riesling
Germany,"The flight of Rheingau dessert wines this appeared in was almost universally disappointing. Like most of the others, this showed some excessively earthy aromas and flavors, although it did possess ample sweetness and attractive musk and spice notes.",Riesling
Germany,"This French-sounding brand has turned out a very good German Riesling, thanks to an assist from the folks at Selbach-Oster. It's a light, dry wine with a fair amount of complexity, including hints of pear, melon, wet stone, petrol and peppery spice. Finishes long, with more minerals and spice.",Riesling
Germany,"At $12 for a single-vineyard kabinett, this is an excellent value, delivering exotic honey, apricot and spice notes. The texture is creamy and silky; the finish is lush and soft. Drink it over the next few years.",Riesling
Germany,"This rather lightweight kabinett is entirely in character for its classification. Even if many 2007 kabinetts are bigger and richer, Bastgen's offers finely detailed flavors of honey, melon, peppery spice and crushed stones. Great apéritif wine.",Riesling
Germany,"Exotic, offering up scents of oranges and apricots, then folding flavors of melon and spice on the palate. It's broad but basically balanced; round yet with adequate acids, picking up hints of citrus pith on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"A very drinkable Riesling, with sweet flavors of apple and honey buttressed by mineral notes and a touch of kerosene. There's enough crispness on the finish to provide balance while the sweetness lingers.",Riesling
Germany,"Wines labeled “Classic” are trocken in style, generally just off-dry. This one delivers scents of honey and peach, while the flavors reflect a sense of dryness, with spice and mineral notes predominating. It's nicely textured on the palate, just comes up a little short on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Beeswax, oranges and crushed stone on the nose, then tangerine and more mineral notes on the palate. It's medium-bodied, prettily plump and succulent before a slightly drying, bitter note emerges on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Some typical Prüm smelly notes are apparent on the nose, but there's also plenty of pineapple and pear scents, and the flavors really blossom on the palate; honeyed pineapple, melon and slate-like notes are sweet but balanced by tongue-tickling acids. Long on the finish, where it picks up additional mineral overtones. Should come into its own by 2016 and last 20–30 years thereafter.",Riesling
Germany,"Rather sweet and rich for a kabinett, with peach, tangerine and honey aromas and flavors that comes across as almost a little sticky in their sugary goodness.",Riesling
Germany,"Despite being largely dry, this is a plump, engaging Riesling with remarkable purity of fruit. Strawberry and pineapple aromas and flavors drive this bus, making it perhaps a touch commercial, but fun all the same. Drink it over the next year or two. Imported by Magellan Wine Imports.",Riesling
Germany,"Displays the majesty of Rhein Riesling in a dry format, combining muscle (13% alcohol) with elegance and length. Layers of dried and fresh fruit unfold on the palate, backed by a solid underpinning of minerality and spice.",Riesling
Germany,"Hugely ripe, with 14.5% alcohol and a touch of residual sweetness, but also a richly textured mouthfeel and layers of honey, apricot preserves, slate-driven minerality and spice. It may be a bit precariously balanced, so opt for drinking it over the near term.",Riesling
Germany,"Smells like honey drizzled over stones with a hint of peach for good measure, then delivers lush, richly fruity flavors of dried apricots allied to crisp, citrusy acids. Nicely balanced, with a long, apricot-filled finish.",Riesling
Germany,"On the dry side for a kabinett, with the alcohol weighing in at 11%. Yet even though the alcohol is relatively high, the wine gives an impression of lightness, balancing melon and white peach flavors with touches of spice and minerality. Drink now–2012.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts off with beautiful scents of ripe peaches, orange blossom and a briny minerality, then delivers all of that and more in a slightly creamy, sensuous mouthful of flavor. The purity of ripe fruit is noteworthy, extending through the long, filigreed finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Now that this famous estate is turning out stellar wines once again, the only problem remaining is the pricing. This auslese features slaty, minerally aromas touched with hints of honey and quince, then opens up on the palate to reveal honey, pear, melon and even a hint of peach, all undergirded by a bedrock of minerality. It's sweet but balanced, with a crystal-clean finish and plenty of length.",Riesling
Germany,"This is a big, broad-shouldered Riesling, with plenty of body and a slightly oily mouthfeel. Powerful mineral notes dominate, giving the impression of liquid stone and spice, finishing almost totally dry.",Riesling
Germany,"Reeks of heating oil at first, then slowly opens to reveal hints of honey, apple and citrus. This is a sweet but not overdone auslese, with a slightly creamy texture and layers of ripe stone fruit that linger and pick up minerally overtones on the lengthy finish.",Riesling
Germany,"A lush and enormously fruity auslese, this offering features layers of appealingly ripe fruit, ranging from honeyed peaches to tropically luscious mangoes. If it's a bit fat and lacks a touch of zip, it makes up for it with sheer deliciousness.",Riesling
Germany,"Befitting the historic nature of the estate, this is wonderfully structured and aristocratic auslese, featuring apple, apricot and citrus seamlessly fastened to a bedrock of firm acidity. Finishes long, with a hint of citrus rind. Should easily age 20 years or more.",Riesling
Germany,"This plump, succulent spätlese starts off with apple and citrus aromas, then delivers intensely mineral flavors reminiscent of crushed vitamins and green apples. Crisp and citrusy on the finish, with a fine sense of poise and balance.",Riesling
Germany,"Smoke and petrol notes lead off, followed up by hints of dried apricot and fresh peach. This is a thick, viscous dry Riesling, oozing with minerality that persists through the long finish. Although most German producers insist wines like this will age, why wait? Drink it over the next few years.",Riesling
Germany,"From 40–70-year-old vines planted on red slate, this is a deeply mineral, almost earthy Riesling, loaded with smoke, diesel and slate aromas and just tinged with apple and citrus. The mouthfeel is slightly creamy, the flavors almost totally dry, the finish finely balanced.",Riesling
Germany,"Smoky, slaty and oily, this is a mineral-driven, “terroir” wine, without obvious fruit notes, yet not lacking for fruit, if that makes any sense. It's medium-bodied, with just a touch of apparent sugar, and finishes long, with just a touch of citrus.",Riesling
Germany,"This complex wine manages to combine dry minerality and sweet fruit in an interesting way. There's a briny note similar to crushed shells on the nose, but also bright cherry aromas, while on the palate an extra note of honey creeps in, imparting sweetness and length on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"The scents of this wine speak indubitably of its place, running the gamut of classic descriptors from apple and lime to honey and slate. It's dry and lithe on the palate, combining citrus and crushed-stone flavors, and finishing crisp and clean.",Riesling
Germany,"Importer Rudi Wiest with the help of Robert Eymael has found a fruity, off-dry Riesling at a great price. The melon, spice and citrus flavors are delivered via a palate that's a little broad, but finish clean. With a little more zip, this would be even better.",Riesling
Germany,"Plump, mouthfilling and sweet, this is an easy-to-appreciate auslese loaded with fruit-driven flavor. Honeyed apples and pear lead the way, garnished by touches of stone fruit, orange marmalade and hints of slaty minerality. There's a slightly bitter tinge to the finish, but it actually helps the wine's overall balance.",Riesling
Germany,"For being a goldkap, this is not especially lush or botrytized. Instead, it features a fine balance of acidity, which enlivens the green apple and citrus flavors and gives them extra poignancy. This is crisply balanced and mouthwatering on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"A stunning expression of place, very mineral but with enough juicy stone fruit nuances to be immediately likeable. It's tight and focused, showing excellent balance and a long, perfumed finish. Drink now (think sushi) or stash away for five or more years for a more laid-back style.",Riesling
Germany,"Truly stunning, this white starts out with subtle talcum powder and gravel notes, then adds intense perfume and peaches in the mouth. There's a finely tuned balance and good length. Exceptional harmony and intensity suggest it will improve for 15 years or more.",Riesling
Germany,"This selection of Huber Spätburgunders was a pleasant surprise, although the prices are enough to make one groan. The Sommerhalde R reveals gently roasted aromas of brown sugar, dried spices and beet root, followed by flavors that lean toward black cherries. It's got that silky, Pinot Noirtexture on the midpalate, then finishes crisp and long.",Spätburgunder
Germany,"The delicacy of the cool Saar valley comes through wonderfully in this off-dry kabinett. Crushed-stone aromas lead the way, followed by zesty, citrusy flavors that elegantly interweave with mineral notes before lingering gracefully on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"To judge by the codes on the label, this Best Buy is from the same bottler who did Rudi Wiest's 2007 Mosel River. This is slightly lighter in weight, with simple apple and citrus flavors tinged with petrol. Off-dry, but clean and fresh on the finish. A wine to drink now and over the next few months.",Riesling
Germany,This wine is a shining example of the glorious minerality that singles out Mosel Riesling. The nose shows really appealing pear and gardenia scents overlaying wet stone notes. The mouthwatering acidity wakes up your palate and is in perfect balance with the substantial residual sugar. Drink now (with sushi) or hold five or more years for even more complexity.,Riesling
Germany,"Despite some initially offputting scents of sweaty socks, this is a charming wine. Apple, citrus and petrol mingle easily once the difficult aromas have dissipated to reveal a medium-bodied, off-dry wine. It's creamy-textured in the mouth, then turns crisp and minerally on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Intensely sweet, concentrated and viscous, but without quite the charm and balance that characterizes the regular Himmelreich auslese in 2006. Once past a bit of sweaty sock on the nose, the flavors show off honeyed orange slices to go with hints of spice and minerality.",Riesling
Germany,"This is pretty sweet for a spätlese but finishes clean and refreshing, thanks to some zippy acids. Aromas of paraffin, wet stones and citrus lead the way, followed up by flavors vaguely reminiscent of lime sherbet.",Riesling
Germany,"A dry, stony, somewhat neutral wine, marked by crisp acids and vaguely apple-y fruit. The crispnesss and austerity would make it a fine foil for creamy or oily fish dishes.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts off with scents of slate, pineapple and vanilla, then delivers apple, melon and lime sherbet flavors. It's off-dry, light in body, and easy enough to drink now and over the next six months or so.",Riesling
Germany,"An expressive, extroverted style that still communicates a sense of place. There's loads of dried fruit character here, with apple, nectarine, rose and graham flour flavors that build to a long-lasting finish. Light-bodied, with a spice aftertaste. Drink now or hold five-plus years.",Riesling
Germany,"Serious and earthy, like walking into a wall of minerality. The fruit takes a back seat here, but is lusciously peachy and fresh while the long finish is sparked by hints of exotic spices. Give this two to three years to show its best.",Riesling
Germany,"Typical of Egon Müller's wines, this is light in body, but titanium-strong in structure, welding rather tart, lemony fruit to stony, minerally notes and embellishing it all with the merest hints of riper, apple-y fruit. It's just off-dry, with great persistence and lipsmacking appeal.",Riesling
Germany,"At 250,000 cases imported, this has to be one of the biggest brands of Riesling on the market. The modern packaging contains a cleanly made, off-dry wine with bright herb and apple notes and a citrusy finish—it's easy to see its mass appeal. Drink now. Imported by Schmitt-Sohne Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"The ‘goldkap,' or ‘gold capsule,' in this wine's designation indicates a riper cuvée than the producer's ordinary spätlese. As expected, the fruit is exuberant and lush with hints of tinned apricots and peach jam. An underlying note of lemon zest enlivens the palate and carries over to the long, flowery finish. There's lots of sweetness here; consider serving on its own.",Riesling
Germany,"A mixture of mineral and spice accompanies the lemon and apricot fruit in this tangy, focused Riesling. There's plenty of intensity and an energizing balance of fresh acidity and lingering sweetness. Drink now or age four to five years.",Riesling
Germany,"Nicely done for an entry-level wine, with slate, fresh floral greens and briny minerality all wrapped up in an off-dry cocoon of green apples and citrus fruits. Fresh and clean on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"The high-quality oak used in this wine really stands out, providing touches of brown sugar, cinnamon, coffee and bacon to the otherwise modest black cherry fruit. It's reasonably full-bodied for a German Pinot Noir, with a long finish and supple tannins.",Spätburgunder
Germany,"Burly in shape, with broad shoulders, ample alcohol and densely packed mineral flavors. Flashes of honey and gingery spice lighten the scene somewhat, but this slightly oily Riesling is darker and more brooding than most. The lingering finish is nearly dry.",Riesling
Germany,"Honey and pear aromas might tease you into thinking this is going to be a fruity wine, but the flavors say otherwise, offering strong heating-oil notes and finishing with mouthwatering balance and stony notes. The stunning minerality of the Doctor vineyard really comes through.",Riesling
Germany,"Muscat comes through loud and clear, offering up aromas redolent of oranges, citrus blossom and spice. It's light in body and off-dry, with refreshing fruit flavors of oranges and nectarines. This would make a fine summertime picnic wine.",Muskateller
Germany,"Aromatic, succulent and invigorating, this Riesling is firing on all cylinders. The palate is on the dry side with powerful flavors of honey, ginger and peach that fade to an enticing spice note.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts off with apple and pineapple aromas, but quickly develops intensely mineral flavors to go alongside. Likewise, it seems round—almost fat—in the mouth at first, then finishes with refreshing acidity, a mouthwatering mix of sweet and tart.",Riesling
Germany,"For a Pauly Bergweiler wine, this is atypically minerally, as its wines have tended toward the lush, fruity side of the spectrum over recent years. Petrol and slate aromas lead into a wine that's round in the mouth but relatively dry in style, with good length and minerality on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Shows good varietal character in a somewhat sweet format. It starts off slightly musky and gingery on the nose, then adds lychee fruit flavors. For its sweetness, it's not particularly richly textured or weighty, making it a possibility as an apéritif.",Traminer
Germany,"A classic Mosel Kabinett that displays the concentration and pure, expressive fruit typical of the great 2008 vintage. There's loads of Asian spice, apple and gardenia on the nose, while a citrus top note come through on the palate. Finishes long, with a lingering mineral edge. Will improve over the next decade or more though it's drinking well now.",Riesling
Germany,"There's a lot going on here, with petroleum, musk, orange flower and clove scents on the nose while the palate is as light as a feather, with mouthwatering acidity and a zippy, cinnamon-infused finish. Drink now or hold several years for more complexity.",Riesling
Germany,"The aromas are of dark honey—there's almost a roasted quality to them that verges on caramel. The flavors follow in a similar vein, suggesting roasted pineapple and caramelized peach, while the mouthfeel is pleasantly rich and filling.",Riesling
Germany,"Of the various Huber Pinot Noirs, this is the one most in need of 2–3 years of cellaring. Some pungent cabbage and cedar aromas should be better integrated by then, and the firm tannins now evident on the finish should also be at least partially resolved. Right now, there's a hint of silkiness and some nice plum and sous-bois notes that should only improve over the short term.",Spätburgunder
Germany,"Very impressive, with a mineral backdrop setting the stage for a powerful expression of apricot and pear fruit. The mouthwatering acidity masks a fair amount of residual sugar, resulting in a lingering finish that seems dry. Drink now or hold for several years for a more nuanced expression.",Riesling
Germany,"Give this wine some air before you serve it in order to appreciate the entire range of its dense aromatics, which flow from delicate tangerine, to peach and on into the mineral end of the spectrum. The palate is juicy, with an energizing tension between the nervy acidity and delicate sweetness. Finishes long, with a slate undertow. Try with cod in a miso sauce.",Riesling
Germany,"For only 11% alcohol and virtually no residual sugar, this is surprisingly weighty, with ample richness and depth. There's a strong petrochemical side to the aroma, but the flavors are fruitier, evoking baked apple and dried spices. Turns citrusy on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Intensely mineral on the nose, followed up on the palate by flavors of crushed vitamin tablets, wet stone and brine. Despite some residual sweetness, the overall impression is of salty, mineral dryness coupled with tart, citrusy flavors on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Even tasted blind, this wine comes across as a bit warm. The 15% alcohol imparts a thick, rich consistency in the mouth, while the flavors stay true to the site, showing notes of ripe peaches, citrus and hints of home heating oil. It's certainly impressive, but the alcohol shows through a bit on the finish, suggesting near-term consumption.",Riesling
Germany,"Concentrated and balanced, with high residual sugar and lip-smacking acidity propping up elegant white flower notes. The long, clean, finish shows pretty green apple inflections. Drink now or cellar two to three years.",Riesling
Germany,"A different aromatic profile here, with bread dough and wet grass scents dominating the nose. It's well structured, with good flowery intensity in the mouth and a weighty, medium-to-long finish. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Slightly funky and leesy on the nose, with somewhat sweaty overtones to the citrus and apple aromas. But the flavors are pure, suggesting that the aromatics just need some time to come around—or a quick decanting. It's medium in body, with a crisp, tangy finish that artfully balances sweet and tart.",Riesling
Germany,"Soft at first, but the density of the pine, gardenia and spice flavors emerges as the wine opens up while the lingering finish shows excellent purity of fruit. Serve with sushi. Drink now or hold three to four years for more complexity.",Riesling
Germany,"Bone dry but harmonious and well balanced, with ripe acidity and restrained pear, honey and petroleum notes in a medium-bodied frame. Its finish is long and minerally. Drinking well now but will show more finesse several years down the road.",Riesling
Germany,"Crisp and tightly wound, this Baden Pinot has lovely cherry pie and vanilla scents folding in to leather and mixed berry flavors on the palate. Long, slightly tart finish of saddle leather. Drink now to 2013.",Pinot Noir
Germany,"Here's a good value in the world of Spätlese, with a clean, pretty nose of talcum powder and baby's breath. There's nice mineral intensity and an off-dry, mouth-puckering finish. This easy-to-like wine would be a good choice to serve as an apéritif to a crowd.",Riesling
Germany,"Very spicy, with candied orange peel and sour drop notes undercut by a lower honey-botrytis element. Appealing, if lacking the purity of the best from this hallowed vineyard. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"This is a zippy little number, with scents of white cherries and citrus that float over a bed of petroleum and fresia. The crisp, off-dry finish winds down to a lingering grapefruit note. Drink now with cod in a miso sauce or stash away for a few years.",Riesling
Germany,"Like drinking a fruit cocktail. This exceptionally pretty white is succulent and balanced, with good depth and penetrating flower notes. The broad, medium-length finish is dominated by ripe cantaloupe and green apple notes. Drink now or hold a few years.",Riesling
Germany,"Generous, with a distinct pine character and tangy passion fruit flavors framing the medium-bodied palate. Exotic, medium finish of curry leaf and lemon curd. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine overdelivers for its pale garnet color. There's loads of sweet cherry fruit along with mocha and caramel character, all set in a bed of soft tannins. A long finish trails off to an extended earth note. Try with leg of lamb. Fully mature, drink up in the next year or two.",Pinot Noir
Germany,"A less fruity take, with mineral and kerosene dominating the nose and a wet slate thread running through the exquisitely crisp palate. Spring flowers and honey notes soften up the finish. Try with Thai noodles.",Riesling
Germany,"On the subtle side for a Mosel Riesling, with shy aromas of melon and peach and a stony character in the mouth. This one is likely to be more expressive after a few years in the cellar.",Riesling
Germany,"Elegant, though there's no shortage of density to these flavors. Membrillo, sour drops and apricot are the main themes, set against a mineral undertow. The palate is crisp and balanced though quite off-dry, winding down to a long, subtle finish of stone fruits. Great now, but will improve over the next few years.",Riesling
Germany,"An exceptional example of what can be done with the humble Silvaner grape, this white is fresh and highly nuanced, with exotic galangal and Asian pear scents that lead to a crisp palate with Guanabana flavor. Dry, medium finish. Drink now to 2011.",Silvaner
Germany,"Savory in aroma, with popcorn and toast flavors punctuated by a spice thread. Noticeably off-dry, this subtle white winds up on a sweet peach note. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Zesty and fresh, with notes of green plums and grass leading to palate of lemon meringue and pineapple. Finishes sweet but well balanced, with a nice stone fruit accent. A good crowd-pleaser at a fair price.",Riesling
Germany,"Rich and succulent, with pineapple and jasmine top notes and intense stone fruit in the mouth. There's no shortage of sweetness here but it's well framed by a vibrant acid structure that carries the fruit through to the medium finish. Really well done.",Riesling
Germany,"Subtle for the type, with delicate quince, apricot and moss notes that lead to a lemony palate. Piquant acidity binds it all together in a taut frame. Off-dry. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Pretty, in a ballet dancer style, with an underlying strength that belies the apparent delicacy. Classic, peachy and delicious.",Riesling
Germany,"A very classic style, with peach and floral notes upfront set against a mineral backdrop. There's riveting acidity in the mouth and some slate character but it fades away a bit too quickly. Drink or hold a few years for a richer texture.",Riesling
Germany,"So incredibly thick and sweet it's almost chewy in texture, with aromas and flavors that feature a fascinating interplay of fresh and dried apricots, peach and citrus, kept lively by healthy acidity. The finish lasts for minutes; the wine should age well for decades.",Riesling
Germany,"The wonderful minerality imparted by the Doctor vineyard is somehow able to keep this intensely sweet, rich wine from being heavy or cloying. Dried apricot notes mark the nose, followed by scents of mango, peach and pineapple; this wine virtually gushes with sweet tropical fruit and honey, yet maintains a wonderful sense of balance throughout.",Riesling
Germany,"This winery has turned out a couple of terrific BAs in 2006 as the family focuses its efforts on its estate wines. Pear, peach, pineapple and spice notes lead the way, garnished by hints of dried apricots in this rich, viscous offering. Finishes long and mouthwatering, not cloying at all—a remarkable achievement in a wine this sweet. Drink now–2040 or beyond.",Riesling
Germany,"Unusual, with pine, bread dough and fish seasoning scents underpinned by a note of lemon. There's mandarin orange in the delicate mouth, and a medium finish shot through with smoky notes. Drink now to 2012.",Riesling
Germany,"Quite off-dry but balanced, with pretty pear scents over a base of wet earth and honey. Medium, slightly funky finish. Ideal to partner with a Malaysian seafood dish. Drink now to 2012.",Riesling
Germany,"Sweet and bracingly tart at the same time, with racy acidity framing sweet orange and lime flavors. Flourishes of bergamot and cinnamon add complexity on the nose and reprise on the long finish.",Riesling
Germany,"For a beerenauslese, usually dominated by honeyed fruit, this shows a surprising degree of stony minerality, which helps to balance the rich, sweet flavors of orange marmalade, dried apricots and honey. Viscous in texture, yet the citrus and mineral notes keep it from becoming cloying. Drink now–2035.",Riesling
Germany,"With scents of dried apricots and superconcentrated pear nectar, one sniff suggests this is going to be a sumptuously sweet treat. And it is. Pear, melon and spice flavors linger elegantly on the finish, ending long and sweet.",Riesling
Germany,"Made from an early picking of botrytized grapes from the Bernkasteler Lay vineyard, this is a sweet, plump wine, filled to the brim with lush tropical fruit flavors. The aromas show remarkably pure pear and pineapple scents, with just a touch of dried apricots but also a sense of slate-driven minerality. With 300 cases imported, it should prove relatively easy to find.",Riesling
Germany,"Rich and thickly textured, this wine features intense botrytis aromas of dried apricots, backing them up with flavors of honey and orange marmalade. Long and intensely sugary on the finish, with enough sugar to genuinely stand up to desserts. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",Riesling
Germany,"Sweet and slightly viscous in texture, this wine lacks some aromatic flourishes, sacrificing complexity for purity of its pineapple, apple and citrus flavors. Yet because of its balanced, crisp acidity, the wine still sings, finishing long and mouthwatering. Drink now–2030.",Riesling
Germany,"Spice and baked fruit are the dominant scents here while an intense flavor of mandarin orange characterizes the palate. It's just off-dry and quite crisp, a good choice for a Thai fish preparation. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"There's sweet, ripe fruit here meshed with black earth notes but also a back note of rhubarb and green vegetables. Crisp, medium finish. A few years in the cellar will help integrate a slightly disjointed vanilla note.",Spätburgunder
Germany,"Dried apricot notes dominate this wine from start to finish, making it a bit one-dimensional. Still, it features impressive sugar-acid balance so despite the sweetness it's not cloying; finishes long, with lipsmacking notes of honeyed pineapple. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",Riesling
Germany,"This is a thoroughly enjoyable sipper with moderate intensity, pretty tiger lily and baby's breath scents and a finish that's all apricot fruit, but with a faint mineral note. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,Ample and off-dry with spunky notes of crushed flowers and fresh herbs. Finishes on a charming note of baked apple. This likable wine is a good choice for a big crowd.,Riesling
Germany,"Opens in an offbeat (in a good way) style, with cantaloupe, orange, chamomile and newly mown hay scents that give way to more classic flavors of wet stones and apricot in the mouth. There's quite a bit of residual sugar here but the crisp acidity results in a fairly dry finish. Drink now to 2011.",Riesling
Germany,"An austere, spicy wine and a successful effort in the trocken category, with Christmas spices and orange peel scents and a light but balanced palate. The clove-inflected finish is just this side of medium. Drink now to 2013.",Riesling
Germany,"This tangy white shows true Mosel character with scents of wet stone, apricot and lime in a delicate, energetic frame. It's crisp and slightly sweet but refreshing throughout. Drink now to 2012.",Riesling
Germany,"Viscous, almost oily in texture, this is several vintages older than most of the recent samples, yet seems so unevolved that it's not out of place. Honey and dried spices are the predominant themes, with citrusy fruit making up the core. Should evolve glacially through at least 2025.",Riesling
Germany,"Sweet and lithe, this is a wonderfully clean and pure expression of Riesling eiswein. There's no botrytis, only sweet pineapple, apple and citrus flavors that finish on lingering notes of orange and lemon. This should last a while in the cellar, but there's really no reason to delay gratification.",Riesling
Germany,"A bit over the top, thickly layered with dried apricots, honey and dried spices. This is one rich, sweet BA, with surprisingly apparent alcohol (9.5%). It finishes a bit low in acid, making it impressive but not classic. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",Riesling
Germany,"Crisp, refreshing and light as a feather, with lemon zest and honeysuckle scents that wind down to a musk finish. There's a lot of flavor here for a fair price; consider this one for your next big gathering.",Riesling
Germany,"Luxurious and off-dry, with faded flower scents shot through with gunflint. Roses and carnations grace the palate, trailing off to a medium, perfumed finish. Try with Thai noodles. Drink at its peak now but will hold a few years.",Riesling
Germany,". Lemon zest and exotic spices enliven the nose while the crisp palate is rounded out by notes of cooked pear. Despite a sweet attack, this Riesling finishes dry and chalky. Drink now to 2011.",Riesling
Germany,"A truly mouthwatering wine, with lovely aromas of freesia, mineral and petroleum, backed up by grapefruit and apricot in the mouth. Finishes fresh and crisp with apple and peach blossom character. Ideal for an apéritif. Drink now.",Silvaner
Germany,"An eiswein that's different—and affordable. Made from Gewürz, it boasts aromas and flavors of caramel or butterscotch, maple syrup and caramelized peaches. It is sweet, without the crispness of a Riesling eiswein, but enjoyable nonetheless. Drink it over the near term.",Gewürztraminer
Germany,"A laid-back take, with root vegetable and mineral scents floating over a bed of ginger and green apples. Passionfruit flavor brings the palate to life while stony notes dominate the short-to-medium finish. Best now to 2011.",Riesling
Germany,"Intriguing, with Indian spice and petroleum top notes followed by pomelo and lime fruit. There's density to the citrus fruit and an overall elegance. It picks up more acidity on the finish, resulting in a refreshing impression. Nicely done.",Riesling
Germany,"A soft, lush, sweet Riesling, but one that lacks the precision and cut of crisp acidity. The avalanche of honeyed fruit—nectarine, peach and pineapple—ends up being merely very enjoyable instead of transporting. Drink now–2015.",Riesling
Germany,"A whimsical name and a whimsical wine, with overt white flower, honeysuckle and melon scents that lead to a softly textured palate, replete with perfume and lychee flavors. Try with seafood in a citrus sauce. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Peach, lemon meringue and pear meld with mineral flavors in a medium-bodied frame. There's a good amount of residual sugar here and lovely grapefruit peel and stone fruit accents on the short-to-medium finish. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"A decadent, extroverted style, with sweet flowers, overripe apricots and a honeysuckle character that is saved from being cloying by a shining streak of acidity. Try with Malaysian food. Drink now to 2014.",Riesling
Germany,"Here's a slightly drier style, with white flower, pear and stone fruit notes interspersed with an austere mineral character. Short-to-medium finish of Chinese spice box. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"A lush, somewhat soft eiswein, with aromas and flavors of superripe oranges or orange marmalade, balanced by a touch of dry, minerally extract on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine starts out with a serious ethyl acetate (nail polish remover) problem but cleans up with aeration. Aromas here are sweet and a bit candyish—sour apple, spiced pear and watermelon flavors that lead to a pleasant, flowery palate. Quite off-dry, with a shortish finish of orange blossom. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"A charming wine at a fair price, with jump-out-of-the-glass potpourri scents backed up by lilies and a cut grass back note. It's a bit monotone in the mouth and has no great density but the pretty note of faded flower petals hangs around just long enough to make you forget all that. Drink up.",Riesling
Germany,"There's admirable ripeness and concentration here but the confected nature of the fruit is distracting. Finishes a bit past short, with a mixed berry note. Best served on its own.",Riesling
Germany,"This is a rich, succulent wine, more akin to an auslese than a true spätlese. Dried apricot and orange marmalade aromas and flavors surround a core of dried spices and crushed stone, finishing on a spicy, mineral note. Drink now–2025.",Riesling
Germany,"With its superripe aromas of honey, melon and spice, this is a mouthfilling, sweet wine. It's round, without any sharp edges, yet maintains German Riesling's unique minerality and cut on the long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now–2020.",Riesling
Germany,"Notes of botrytis, carnations and spring vegetables open this dry Rheinhessen white. The palate is straightforward and pointedly crisp, winding up on a clove note. A good choice for fans of Pinot Grigio. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"A cozy, likable wine, with gardenia, honeycomb and grapefruit themes. It's just off-dry and has good weight and density in the mouth, though it falls a bit short. A good pick for warm weather sipping.",Riesling
Germany,"Opens with a candied note, cut through with spice and apricot scents. There's good intensity and fresh acidity in the mouth and an appealing final note of burnt orange peel. Serve as an apéritif. Drink now.",Silvaner
Germany,Unusual aromatics are dominated by hints of zucchini and other green vegetables. There's a pleasant spice theme to the palate but also some very aggressive tannins. Rhubarb flavors show through on the medium finish. Give the tannins a few years to round out.,Pinot Noir
Germany,"This is rather sweet—loaded with honeyed peaches and tropical fruit—but all of those ripe, rich flavors are brought into focus by the citrus- and mineral-edged finish. It's luscious now, but in 5–10 years it should be a complex, filigreed table wine.",Riesling
Germany,"Straightforward and creamy, with lemon zest and white cherry accents and a lively, citrus palate that's not too sweet. Finishes dry, with a lingering wet stone note.",Riesling
Germany,"A perky, zesty wine, with appealing moss and honeysuckle scents followed by a grapefruit peel character in the mouth. Feels soft and light on the palate but finishes clean. Drink up.",Riesling
Germany,"An obvious but appealing aroma of sour candy lead into a dry palate that's crisp but balanced, with nice pear and grapefruit inflections. An apple note shows through on the short-to-medium finish. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Hints of dried apricot mark the nose and palate, adding an additional layer of complexity to its standout notes of ripe apple, pear, honey and orange zest. Somehow it manages to be creamy and dense in texture and weight without seeming heavy, making for a wonderfully harmonious drinking experience. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",Riesling
Germany,"A good value among spätlesen, Mönchhof's 2005 Mosel Slate avoids the superripeness of the vintage, instead staying true to type. Hints of kerosene give a slate-like impression, layered over crisp lime and apple flavors. It's lithe and sinuous, ending crisp and racy.",Riesling
Germany,"At just three years old, this bottle shows some developed petroleum notes that add interest to the often lackluster Silvaner grape. The mouth has an interesting pineapple element, carrying over to the medium finish. This is a relaxed, food-oriented style that would go well with a Mediterranean fish preparation. Drink now.",Silvaner
Germany,"Honest and clean, with white flower charm and a mouthwatering palate that shows nice honeysuckle and lily character. Quince and beeswax come through on the crisp but slightly sweet finish. Drink now or in 2011.",Riesling
Germany,"Clearly in the mineral camp, with aromas of wet stones and gravel taking precedence over the peach fruit. Some nice lanolin and kiwi flavors peek through in the mouth, set against a soft, light-bodied structure. The mineral finish is on the short side. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Prospective purchasers should bear in mind that this wine was harvested at sugar levels far beyond the minimum spätlese requirements. This is more of a big auslese or small beerenauslese in terms of sugar and style, marrying dried apricot aromas with notes of candied pineapple and spice. It's very sweet and honeyed, and would be cloying were it not for its firm acid backbone. This can be cellared for 20 years. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",Riesling
Germany,"Loosen's 2006 Erdener Treppchen spätlese delivers everything you'd want from a Mosel Riesling. It's light and low in alcohol (7%), yet rich and dense in extract. Sweet, yet tart, with a great sense of balance. And the flavors of apple and pear, citrus and slate are pure and well defined. Drink it now and over the next 15 years.",Riesling
Germany,"Manfred Prüm looks to have followed up his amazing 2005s with 2006s that come close in quality. The 2006 WS spätlese shows a certain reserved minerality on the nose, but opens up into a gorgeously layered palate of apple, vanilla and citrus flavors. It's medium-bodied but zesty and fresh at the same that it's creamy and rich. And there's plenty of concentration and length on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Some German vineyards suffered from low acidity in 2006, but Wagner's portion of the Saarburger Rausch was obviously not one of them. This is unusually light, tart and fresh for the vintage, with classic green apple, citrus and slate aromas and flavors and incredible focus. Very refreshing. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine's elevated—for a fruchtig German Riesling—alcohol level (11.5%) and botrytis-influenced flavors of dried apricots and orange marmalade suggest early consumption, although some may want to see if it settles down in another five years. It's fat, oily and rich right now, and a bit warming on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"There's more minerality here than one has a right to expect from a Qualitätswein, along with pretty peach and pear fruit, all wrapped in an approachable (but not slack) structure. Drink up.",Riesling
Germany,"An unusual nose for a Riesling, with yeast, brioche and fresh eggs dominating. The dough-flavored palate is harmonious, with just a touch of sweetness balancing the crisp acidity. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Earthy and crisp, with mixed berry and moss notes peaking through a heavy layer of vanilla. Light-bodied, caramel-flavored palate. Try with lamb chops. Will improve with a year or two in the cellar.",Spätburgunder
Germany,"There's an unusual, but not unappealing, collection of aromas here, from ginger and nutmeg to balsa wood, talcum powder and petroleum. A bit candied in the mouth, with a hit of cinnamon on the short finish. Drink up.",Silvaner
Germany,"This wine comes out of the bottle a little cranky, but give it some time in the glass and the initial stink gives way to notes of lime, apple and peach. It's plump in feel, with some dusty minerality and dried spices adding nuance to the sweet fruit.",Riesling
Germany,"This is close to dry in style, with its baked apple and spice flavors supported by stony, mineral notes and ample (12.5%) alcohol. It's fairly full-bodied for a German Riesling, finishing with hints of mineral oil that cling to the palate. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"From a top site, this is a big, full-bodied dry Riesling that features aromas of honey, mint and Golden Delicious apple. Those ripe apple notes continue on the palate, picking up citrus and herbal notes on the extended finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Ripe and richly fruity, with chunky flavors of oranges, honey and tropical fruit tinged with hints of mineral and orange pekoe tea. It's a lush mouthful of easy-to-enjoy fruit.",Riesling
Germany,"Rich, viscous and sweet, this is a spätlese that punches above its weight. A bit of dried apricot hints at the inclusion of some botrytized grapes, while the rest of the fruit shows superripe flavors of peaches and honey. This is long on the finish, clinging to the palate. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",Riesling
Germany,"This is a rather big and burly wine for a Mosel spätlese, weighing in at 11.5% alcohol. And while it shows plenty of power, it also shows nuance in its aromas and flavors, which range from baked fruit, honey and spiced marmalade to oily, mineral essences. Has the concentration to age, but the balance of sugar and alcohol may not hold in the long run—drink it over the next few years to avoid disappointment.",Riesling
Germany,"Hints of spring flowers and slate accent this wine's fruity aromas, while the flavors are pristine and pure—a melding of mineral, vanilla, orange, honey and peach that lingers delicately on the finish. It's mouthfilling, yet zesty, thanks to low alcohol (7.5%) and racy acidity.",Riesling
Germany,"This is an exotic, flashy wine, marked by layers of ripe, sweet tropical fruit. Honey, peaches and mangoes are plump and mouthfilling, but end with elegance and finesse, making for a finely balanced wine worthy of the two-star accolade.",Riesling
Germany,"Dry Mosel wines are rarely very successful and this example is no exception. More residual sugar, less acid or both would have been an improvement. As is, it strikes a shrill note, though the white flower aromatics are undoubtedly appealing.",Riesling
Germany,"Lush aromas of mango and lychee are contradicted by the austere structure of this wine. The acidity is severe and the finish, though it shows some nice nut tones, ends on a drying note. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Aromatic yet not overly complex, with apple, orange and tangerine scents punctuated by faint minerality. The palate is nicely perfumed but a tad on the tart side. Drink up.",Riesling
Germany,"This Silvaner shows more aromatic sophistication than most of its brethren; there's baking spices, white flowers and apples on the nose with a saffron undertone. Crisp and earthy in the mouth, with good palate weight and a short to medium finish of lime peel. Drink up.",Silvaner
Germany,"Pleasantly plump and custardy in texture, this complex, mouthfilling wine offers a whirl of aromas and flavors, ranging from fresh asphalt to lime custard and green apple. By the finish, any objectionable notes have vanished, leaving a clean, lingering finish beaming with elegance. Consider decanting if drinking in the near future, or simply hold 3–5 years before sampling.",Riesling
Germany,"Aromas redolent of slate, pineapple and lime cascade from the glass of this medium-bodied, beautifully balanced wine. It's sweet but crisp, with ample concentration and a lingering finish that takes on hints of orange pith as it lingers. Drink now–2020.",Riesling
Germany,"This is a prototypical Saar Riesling, with classic green apple and citrus flavors underscored by slate-driven minerality that lingers for a long time on the finish. Despite the sensation of plumpness, the wine is light on its feet. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine is notably sweet, but its sugars are balanced by ample acidity, making it crisp and refreshing. Hints of slate on the nose are complemented by apple and citrus aromas, while the flavors run toward honey, bergamot and ripe melon. Finishes long, with the acids imparting a mouthwatering quality.",Riesling
Germany,"This smells superripe—the fruit seems almost caramelized—but there's also a refreshing bright beam of citrus as well, bringing the sweetness into balance. At the moment, there's a bit of a disconnect between the honeyed flavors and crisp, lime-like acids, but these elements should come into better harmony over the next few years.",Riesling
Germany,"Imagine honeyed orange sections—that's what the aromas of this wine call to mind. In the mouth, there's plenty of sweetness and power and a rich, creamy mouthfeel, matched by strident acids. Orange, apple and spice flavors linger on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"What a contrast with Johannishof's more linear V bottling. The G hits the spot, featuring intense clover-blossom honey, apple and citrus notes. It's plump in the mouth, medium-bodied but with great balance between acids aand sugars. Finishes long and refreshing, marked by pronounced dry minerality. Drink now–2020.",Riesling
Germany,There's some mossy tones under the fresh pear fruit along with a slight spritz that keeps everything lively. Pretty lemon and grapefruit notes show through on the (slightly tart) finish. Drink now.,Riesling
Germany,"Light and airy, with petroleum, verbena and spring flower scents and a medium finish with nice gravel and lemon notes. Not a trace of sweetness. Try with raw clams. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"The steep slopes of the Himmelreich provided some wonderful wines in 2005, and Raimund Prüm's offering has turned out well. It's a touch more muscular than some vintages, but finely focused, marrying aromas of green apple and crushed stone with flavors of honey, peach and pineapple and ending in a long, mouthwatering finish.",Riesling
Germany,"On the full side for a Mosel Riesling, this mouthcoating, succulent wine features piercingly pure fruit aromas of apple, citrus and honey. It's richly fruity on the palate as well, adding in hints of strawberries, which fade slowly and elegantly on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Thick, oily and sweet, this wine is clearly not a typical spätlese. Dried apricots, baked apple and dried spices coat the palate, finishing long and sweet but with just enough lime-like acidity for balance. Drink now–2020. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",Riesling
Germany,"Despite plenty of honeyed sweetness, this wine's slate-driven minerality and zesty acids and slight touch of CO2 keep it nicely balanced. It's light in body, with crisp lime flavors, making it a great candidate for sipping during the dog days of summer.",Riesling
Germany,"Made in a powerful, almost dry style with 12% alcohol, this is not a typical kabinett. The aromas boast admirably pure pear and pineapple scents, but the flavors show slaty, spicy complexity—this is much more than simply fruity. The texture is creamy and the lingering finish shows off more spice and stones. Might age, but it's so impressive now, why wait?",Riesling
Germany,"This light, fresh-tasting sparkler tastes something like a still Riesling from the Mosel, with zesty lime and lemon zest flavors enlivened by bubbles and a bit of underlying minerality. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",Riesling
Germany,"Aromas are redolent of a candy store—cotton candy, watermelon sours and candied apples. The palate is a sharp contrast, dry, austere and a bit thin. A few years in the cellar will help tame the piercing acidity.",Riesling
Germany,"Opens with exotic notes of musk and summer jasmine, backed up by scents of tangerine. The dry palate is light and more straightforward, wrapping up with a short burst of lemon peel.",Riesling
Germany,"Light and pretty on the nose, with carnations, lemon and just a hint of candied ginger in the background. A tad watery in the mouth, with a short citrus peel aftertaste. Drink up.",Silvaner
Germany,"Baking scents have the upper hand here, along with a sprinkling of fresh citrus tones that glide through to the finish on a slick of biting acidity. Try with chips & dip. Drink up.",Riesling
Germany,"There's definitely something funky going on though the nose is not unappealing, with some nice apricot overtones. Crisp and lightweight, it turns a bit sharp at the end.",Riesling
Germany,"The Gunderloch wines are among the best from Rheinhessen, even their non-site-specific wines like the Diva spätlese. Aromas of bergamot, pear and fresh greens give way to ripe pineapple, citrus and herb flavors. It's fresh and zippy, offering a lot of refreshment value in an off-dry style.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine's aromas of baked apple, honey, cinnamon and brown sugar are immediately attractive, and in the mouth it doesn't disappoint. It's broad and mouthfilling but avoids heaviness, finishing long, with hints of orange rind.",Riesling
Germany,"Broad in the mouth and rather burly, this nearly dry Riesling offers minerally, spice-driven aromas and flavors. A touch of honeyed richness on the palate rounds it out, but this is not a stereotypical fruity Riesling despite the mouthwatering finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine has balanced acidity, but think of it as a baby auslese because the residual sugar level is quite high and there is some suggestion of botrytis. Aromas and flavors are tinged with dried apricots and honey, rounded out by ripe peaches and given shape by fresh limes. Drink now–2020.",Riesling
Germany,"Despite this wine's considerable sweetness, it features a balanced blend of minerality and fruit. Pear and slate notes mark the nose and palate, finishing soft and round. An easy-drinking kabinett for near-term consumption.",Riesling
Germany,"Honey, cream and watermelon notes make for a likable opening. The crisp, citrusy palate is straightforward, with just a hint of softness. Medium lime and fresia finish. Drink now.",Silvaner
Germany,"Dry and a bit sharp, this Rheinhessen trocken has some funky low notes under its peach and pear fruit. It's light on its feet and suitable for a raw bar. Drink up.",Riesling
Germany,"Simple but pleasant sipper, with understated aromas of talcum powder, fresh grapes and quince. Finishes light, peachy and clean. A good companion for sushi. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"While the scents are decadent—honey, ginger and candied pineapple—the achingly dry palate makes a tart impression. Try with oysters. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"This white from the Franken region of Germany shows more aromatic intensity than your typical Silvaner, but there's a candied edge here that's a bit offputting. It's crisp in the mouth, with good body and some nice apple notes that linger. Drink now.",Silvaner
Germany,"A bit bland, with some maraschino cherry character along with faint melon rind notes. There's good acidity in the mouth but the short finish of spiced pear leaves behind a soft, slightly muddled impression.",Silvaner
Germany,"The confectionary notes here are a bit over-the-top, with bubblegum and candied pineapple leading into candied ginger in the mouth. It's crisp and light-to-medium-bodied, with a short, apricot finish. Drink up.",Silvaner
Germany,"The nose lacks punch, offering only faint notes of melon and white flowers while the crisp, fairly dry palate sails by on fleeting notes of white raspberry and pomelo. Not one for aging.",Riesling
Germany,"A muscular, off-dry Riesling, marked by aromas of slate, melon and spice and flavors that include hints of anise and diesel oil. Although not marked as such, it seems halbtrocken in style, with just enough sugar to cushion the crisp acidity. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Imbued with an almost smoky mineral essence, this wine is moderately sweet, but balanced by crisp acids. Melon and pineapple flavors take over on the palate, but the minerality comes back to the fore on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Despite notes of honey and baked apple, this is an almost dry wine, boasting plenty of weight in the mouth. Orangey flavors pick up hints of peach and dried spices, turning stony on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Impressive for its minerality, this wine offers up aromas of petrol, honey and slate rather than the fruit-driven notes of many Rieslings. In the mouth, it's like drinking liquid rocks with just enough honey to help the minerals slide down smoothly, lingering sweetly on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"In really warm years like 2006, wines from the cool Saar valley often excel. This offering shows crisp, refreshing acidity to balance its residual sugar and classic flavors of green apple, lime and pineapple. Under it all is a firm foundation of slate-driven minerality and a fine, linear structure.",Riesling
Germany,"In a departure from Mosel stereotypes, this wine is missing the floral fragrance and vivacity so typical of the region. But it remains impressive, offering plenty of concentration and density, hugely mineral aromas and flavors that call to mind molten rocks and even an oily texture and viscous finish. How it will age is impossible to predict, so drink it over the next 2–3 years.",Riesling
Germany,"A selection from the Würzburger Innere Leiste, this wine offers something of a conundrum: the aromas and flavors are on one hand those of cooked or stewed fruit, while at the same time the wine is light-bodied, silky and vibrant. Worth a try.",Spätburgunder
Germany,"Exceeds even this producer's stunning beerenauslese, featuring an even more intoxicating perfume of honey, dried apricots and candied pineapple, with slightly more acidity to provide balance to the extra level of sweetness, so much so that this wine comes across as refreshing on the finish, despite the incredibly high levels of sugar. Drink now–2050, possibly longer.",Riesling
Germany,"From a vintage not known for its supersweet selections, this wine is a revelation. Honey and bergamot notes mingle easily on the nose, while the palate unfolds to reveal layers of honey, dried apricots and orange marmalade. It's rich, viscous and concentrated without any heaviness, with a finish that's sweet and lingering. This should age through 2040 easily.",Riesling
Germany,"Despite the name, this wine is a bit done up aromatically; it's austere and lacking in fruit with just a shy note of lemon zest to soften things. Ultracrisp and dry in the mouth, it has a clean citrusy finish. Drink up.",Riesling
Germany,"A plump, amply concentrated Riesling, with plenty of pineapple fruit to balance the hints of kerosene, slate and lime. Finishes crisp and clean, with a dry quality that invites another sip. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Strongly petrolly and slaty, with those powerful elements backed by apple and pineapple notes. It's plump for a kabinett, weighing in at 10.5% alcohol, but balanced and easy to drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"From Trittenheim's most famous vineyard, this is a beautifully balanced, harmonious wine that balances hints of petrol and slate with flavors of honeyed peaches, all while remaining light and spry on the palate.",Riesling
Germany,"This fruit-driven wine lacks a touch of minerality but features admirably pure, focused notes of perfectly ripe apples, pineapple and citrus. It's a sweet, medium-bodied spätlese that's plump and succulent, delicious sipped on its own on a warm summer evening. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",Riesling
Germany,"Hugely sweet and decadent, this is a tour de force of botrytized winemaking. Honeyed citrus aromas are buoyed by hints of perfume and spice, with dried apricot flavors accented by spiced honey. Mouthcoating, rich and impossibly long, this wine should easily age for 40 or more years.",Riesling
Germany,"This starts off with some odd wet wool and fresh tar notes, but quickly rights itself, delivering a medium-bodied mouthful of crisp lime and melon fruit. If possible, give it a quick splash in a decanter before drinking.",Riesling
Germany,"Unusually lean and precise for a 2006, this shows some very floral, perfumed notes on the nose, and then delivers crisp green apple and underripe melon flavors.",Riesling
Germany,"The Pauly Bergweiler style leans toward ripe and sweet, but this bottling also shows plenty of acidity. Honeyed orange and pineapple flavors are concentrated and rich, balanced by hints of petrol, slate and peppery spice.",Riesling
Germany,"A plump, medium-bodied Riesling, this shows the ripeness of the vintage in its ample alcohol (11.5%) and remaining residual sweetness, but doesn't seem heavy or overdone. Honeyed stone fruit and melon are buoyed by some slate-driven minerality while the finish remains succulent and fresh.",Riesling
Germany,"Intrigues on the nose, offering tantalizing hints of smoke, nuts and honey. But this wine is thick and sweet, and it clings to the sides of the glass, defying attempts to shake it out afterwards. The gooey marmalade flavors finish long and sticky.",Riesling
Germany,"Enticingly complex nose, multifaceted, with a medley of blossoms, honey, spice, white peaches and ample minerality showing through. Sweet, with delicious racy acidity and a lively taut texture. This is very focused, with generous flavors of elderberries, stone fruit, orange citrus, spice and slate. Long, persistent finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Schloss Saarstein's auslese is remarkably consistent year to year, testament to the greatness of the site and the quality of the farming and winemaking. The 2008 features cool, slate-driven scents softened just slightly by hints of superripe apples and ripe apricot. This medium-bodied wine is clean and tightly focused, with the sweetness admirably balanced by crisp acids. Should age 15 years or more.",Riesling
Germany,"This succulent, almost tender, wine starts off with lovely aromas of honey and bergamot, adding hints of apricot and vanilla in the mouth. It's a soft, lush style, rather sweet, with a long, mouthwatering finish. It may not be as long-lived as some 2007s, but it should remain delectable for another 10 years or so.",Riesling
Germany,"Realistically priced for genuine German eiswein, this is also rather alcoholic for most, weighing in at 10% abv. So it may not be as sweet as expected, but it still shows razor-like focus, with the residual sweetness balanced by bright pink grapefruit and pineapple notes.",Riesling
Germany,"Shows lovely balance between intense sweetness and crisp acidity, so that the wine's honeyed citrus notes really sing. Hints of marmalade, clove and a perfumed, slightly minty note all add complexity. Delicious now, and probably for a good many years to come.",Riesling
Germany,"Shows the warm vintage in its array of peach, cinnamon and melon flavors and slightly elevated (10.5%) alcohol, but manages to stay off-dry and nicely balanced; it even has some crushed-stone scents to add interest. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Bargain-hunting shoppers should be happy to find this in their local stores. Presumably a blend from different Rhein regions—hence the lowly Tafelwein designation—it is nevertheless a tasty, balanced wine. Lime and slate notes power the bouquet, while the flavors are rounder and more lush. Off dry; drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine doesn't have the easy elegance of Nik Weis's best vintages, but it still packs in plenty of mineral-tinged apple and citrus flavor. Give it a year or two to come together, then drink it over the next five.",Riesling
Germany,"This medium-bodied kabinett features an appealing lushness to its texture—it's not a slim, racy wine but instead offers hints of honey and diesel oil balanced by ripe apples and citrus. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"For this wine's modest reported alcohol level (8%), it doesn't come across as being overly sweet, but boasts a broad, fullish mouthfeel. Tropical fruit—mango—marries easily with peach and lime flavors and a touch of honey. Turns tart on the finish, adding more lime to the flavorful mix.",Riesling
Germany,"Light in weight despite 9.5% alcohol, this is a refreshingly off-dry Riesling with a mouthwatering finish. Green apple, lime and mineral notes round out the typical flavor profile.",Riesling
Germany,"An affordable BA, presumably from a variety of vineyard sites, this is relatively light in body, but it's still a sweet little wine. Fresh apple and citrus aromas and flavors fold in touches of cinnamon, finishing clean and fresh. The bright acidity suggests this may work best as a foil for foie gras or cheeses rather than as a true dessert wine.",Riesling
Germany,"Crisp and clean, with a long, delicately wrought finish, this is a throwback to the auslesen of earlier times, without heaps of sweetness, but instead playing off the fine balance between sugar and acid. Floral and citrus aromas weave around a core of green apple fruit, while a bass line of slatey minerality underscores the melody.",Riesling
Germany,"Big and full-bodied, with just a touch of sugar in evidence, while the alcohol is up to 13%. Petrol and slate notes mark the nose, while the fruit features pineapple, nectarine and melon. Long, powerful and citrusy on the finish, with underlying minerality and spice that provides fascinating complexity. Great now, but there's no reason this shouldn't age well for five or more years.",Riesling
Germany,"Mid gold in color, this wine displays unctuous aromas of honey, ripe apricot, wildflowers and slate. Sweet, but has a lovely raciness on the palate. The plump peach and apricot flavors are layered with hints of anise, slate and honey that come across as very pure and elegant. Taut, focused palate and a long, juicy minerally finish.",Riesling
Germany,"A lush, sweet auslese, the 2008 Jesuitengarten from von Bassermann-Jordan is unctuous in texture and laden with tropical fruit, with just enough citrus for balance. It finishes long and sweet, but clean, inviting one back for another sip. Drink now–2025, possibly longer.",Riesling
Germany,"This wonderful auslese offers volume and richness without weight—it's a sort of fluffy custard in texture, loaded with funky, leesy notes on the nose but also with passion fruit, green apple and pineapple notes on the palate. Yes, it's sweet, but the acids provide beautiful balance on the finish. Drink now–2025.",Riesling
Germany,"Lithe and streamlined, with spare fruit aboard a minerally frame. Kerosene and petrol notes dominate, ending with a burst of fresh lime-like flavors.",Riesling
Germany,"A solid value in German Riesling that just misses out being a Best Buy, this wine features aromas of honey-drizzled baked apples with cinnamon and lemon juice, a refreshingly light feel on the palate and an ultraclean, persistent finish with undertones of ripe melon. Drink now–2015.",Riesling
Germany,"Reasonably priced, this fruit-bowl auslese boasts hints of dried apricot, heaps of ultraripe stone fruit and just enough citrusy notes for balance. It's a more classic vintage, so not as rich or unctuous as the 2003s or 2005s, but leaner and more focused, with a balanced, fresh finish. Drink now–2020.",Riesling
Germany,"A Riesling with an enticing nose of honeysuckle and other summer blossoms, stone fruit and focused stony minerality. There's a wonderfully taut palate, fantastically racy and refreshing, with layers of persistent flavor intensity. The minerality stays with you all the way to a very long lingering finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This auslese is less obviously fruity than many of Loosen's recent efforts, with a smoky, fuel-oil overlay to the honeyed and stone-like flavors. At only 7.5% alcohol, it's sweet yet not heavy, balanced by bright acidity and a hint of prickly CO2 still in evidence. Drink it over the next 15–20 years.",Riesling
Germany,"A departure from the last couple of vintages, with a unique scent of chestnuts adding interest to the sweet, concentrated notes of honey and orange marmalade. It's an odd, different accent, yet the balance of sweetness and bracing acidity is spot on.",Riesling
Germany,"Pale gold in color. The attractive nose features ripe yellow stone fruit with strong mineral overtones, while the palate reveals enough crisp, refreshing acidity to balance the sweetness. There's a smooth, rich texture, showing ample flavors of ripe stone fruit, floral notes and honey. Concentrated, with a moderately long, fresh finish.",Riesling
Germany,"An unoaked blend of 68% Chardonnay and 32% Pinot Blanc, with the peach and sweet-corn Chard flavors to pair with the orange and grapefruit notes of the Pinot Blanc. It's round and mouthfilling, finishing with hints of spice and citrus. Drink now.",Chardonnay-Pinot Blanc
Germany,"Slaty minerality frames bold pineapple and lime aromas and flavors in this medium-bodied, nearly dry Riesling. Fresh and minerally on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This is a lithe, sinewy wine, powerful yet lean, with coiled intensity to its crisp citrus and mineral flavors. It finishes long and tart, with the bracing acids suggestive of a long evolution. Hold 3–5 years and see if it blossoms.",Riesling
Germany,"With 12% alcohol, you might expect this to be on the dry side, but it's not. Instead, it's sweet and oily, with ripe apple, pear and peach fruit vying with notes of crushed stone. Lingers a bit stickily on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Honeyed and viscous—this practically pours like syrup—this is a rich dessert wine, filled with flavors of dried apricots and ultraripe peaches. It's long and sugary on the finish, just lacks a bit of acid balance, and while the hints of caramelized nuts may add complexity, they could also be a hint of oxidation. Drink now, in small doses.",Riesling
Germany,"This may seem a bit sweet and heavy next to J.J. Prüm's bottling from the same vineyard, but it's still a darn good wine, with hints of dried apricots to accent pear, melon and spice flavors. It's thick and viscous, with a finish that lingers sweetly. Drink 2013-2020.",Riesling
Germany,"Moderately sweet and viscous, without the intense concentration seen in some of the vintage's BAs, this remains a skilfully balanced wine, with candied pineapple, citrus and honey balanced by fresh acidity. Drink it over the next 25 years or so.",Riesling
Germany,"Fairly broad aromas show some evolution with honey notes adding intrigue to ripe stone fruit and floral notes. Medium-sweet, but balanced and taut, with a juicy, crisp texture and lots of minerality on the palate. Persistent layers of flavors with honey, apricot, peach, spice showing nicely. Long minerally finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This is awfully creamy and lush for a kabinett, but yummy at the same time. Some hints of lees and funk add complexity to the sweet green apple, passion fruit and lime flavors. Finishes long, with lingering notes of crushed stone, citrus and honey.",Riesling
Germany,"Fresh and gingery, this lightweight sparkling wine adds modest earth notes on the palate.",Riesling
Germany,"Inviting layered aromas of ripe stone fruit, hints of citrus and some earthy spice and minerality. Crisp and refreshing. Very good depth and intensity of lively youthful fruit with a strong mineral core adding complexity. Medium sweet and balanced with a long finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Nicely layered, with inviting fusel notes, ripe yellow fruit and honey aromas. Very minerally. Deliciously crisp, juicy and focused with a nicely taut palate. Lovely rich texture, racy and balanced. Medium sweet, with ample flavor depth—stone fruit, hints of guava, citrus and persistent minerality on a long finish.",Riesling
Germany,"A delicate nose of complex aromas with striking stony minerality goes alongside aromas of honeysuckle, white lilac, elder flower and white peach. Very taut yet filigreed on the palate, this pale, lemon-colored wine is sweet, yet crisp and poised. Ample juicy ripe fruit flavors persist across the palate and lead to a long and layered, refreshing finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Complex, intense nose of fresh honeysuckle, tangerines, marmalade, spice, dried apricots, golden raisins and an earthy minerality abound. Delightfully rich and sweet, but lively and fresh, with nicely balanced racy acidity. Generous concentration of flavor that coats the whole palate and lingers to a sweet but vibrantly juicy finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Prüm's 2007 Sonnenuhr auslese shows a typical youthful yeasty-leesy-sulfur funk, but also layers of ripe pear and citrus fruit lurking underneath. It's sweet but wonderfully balanced, plump and creamy in texture and long on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"On the dry side, this medium-bodied kabinett clocks in at 11% alcohol but seems balanced anyway, with peach and pear aromas and flavors given complexity through notes of smoke, clover blossom and mint. Crisp and refreshing on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Nearly dry in style, this wine starts off with primary fruit aromas of ripe apples, slightly underripe peaches and a touch of grapefruit, then delivers stonier, more minerally flavors on the palate. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",Riesling
Germany,"Fresh and floral on the nose, this is a clean, zesty example of kabinett, the type that was difficult to craft in 2006. Citrus and green apple flavors are true to type, with hints of fresh greens and spring flowers adding a bit of complexity.",Riesling
Germany,"This delectable kabinett starts off with amazingly pure scents of crushed stone, lime and apple, then follows up with flavors of strawberries to go with more apples and limes. It's medium-bodied, slightly sweet but with the crispness to balance its sugars. Finishes pristine and fresh. Drink now-2016.",Riesling
Germany,"There's a slight hint of mushroominess to this wine's aromas, but otherwise it's rather clean, featuring apricot and candied orange aromas and flavors. Offers plenty of depth without being syrupy, ending with a pithy note to help balance the sweetness. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"A pale, lemon color Riesling. The complex nose of honey, delicate stone fruit, elder-flower and stony minerality is deliciously inviting, while intense, focused ripe fruit prevails all across the palate. This is sweet, yet crisp and oozing freshness, with a taut, lively texture. Very long, complex and subtle at the same time.",Riesling
Germany,"Medium gold in color. Attractive nose, quite citrussy, orange with floral notes and a touch of honey. Layered and reasonably complex. Dry and richly textured on the palate and medium bodied. Nicely taut and well balanced with ample ripe orchard and melon fruit. Evident minerality right across the palate to the finish, which is persistent, layered and savory.",Chardonnay
Germany,"A wine with an inviting nose of ripe fruit, layered with notes of honey and lovely, savory-earthy minerality. This is broad across the palate, with a smooth rich texture. Dry and fresh, featuring ample flavors of ripe orchard and stone fruit, with spice and balsamic notes adding complexity. Long length and a persistent savory finish.",Weissburgunder
Germany,"Pale lemony color. Some initial reductive notes blow off to reveal a classic Mosel nose of delicate flowers, white stone fruit and slate. Crisp, elegant, juicy and packed with mouthwatering stone fruit and citrus flavors. Very minerally, taut and focused, with tremendous length and a persistent, juicy finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Lemon in color, with pronounced floral aromas—elder-flower, honeysuckle and acacia—alongside white peaches and nectarines. There's a strong mineral focus on the nose. Sweet, yet deliciously crisp and juicy, with ample flavor concentration. Taut and lively, and has a long minerally finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This auslese shows a wonderfully lithe and racy character that's different from this house's typical style. Crushed stone, apple, citrus and a trace of vanilla bean mark the nose, followed by flavors of pineapple inlaid with filigreed minerality.",Riesling
Germany,"This terrific dry Riesling features a complex interplay of mineral notes, honey, peach, citrus and dried spices. At 12.5% alcohol, it's pretty full-bodied and richly textured, with touches of lingering honey and citrus on the long, mineral-inflected finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Full-bodied and viscous without being overly sweet, this intense, powerful expression of Riesling features hints of apricot, bold green apple and lime notes and a touch of mushroom. The finish boasts heaps of spice and crisp acids for balance, trailing away ever so slowly.",Riesling
Germany,"This auslese shows tremendously lush fruit and a wonderful sense of purity to its aromas and flavors. Scents of pineapple, vanilla and crushed stone lead the way, followed by notes of tropical fruit wrapped around a core of slate. Drink now–2015.",Riesling
Germany,"From a little-seen village of the Middle Mosel, this is a solid effort. It's light in weight and linear in structure, without the mouthcoating ripeness seen in many 2006s, but imbued with petrol and mineral notes that highlight green apple and citrus flavors.",Riesling
Germany,"Intensely sweet, as you might expect, with scents of honey, dried apricots and clover. But there's also a hint of vinyl or plastic that mars the nose and the palate, so although this is sticky and long on the finish, it doesn't quite make top marks.",Riesling
Germany,"A strongly minerally wine, the 2005 Maria v. O. boasts perfumes of heating oil and smoke, while the flavors are of apple, pear and citrus, all wrapped in a petrolly shroud. Yet for all that, it also features sweetness balanced by lime-like acid and a clean, refreshing finish. Drink now–2015.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine boasts a lovely nose redolent of dried apricots and bergamot, with fresh, mossy hints on the background. On the palate, it's medium bodied, not overly sweet or concentrated but with clean melon and citrus flavors that finish clean and fresh.",Riesling
Germany,"From young vines, this is a sweet, slightly simple, but nicely balanced wine, displaying plenty of ripe apple and citrus flavors. The lingering, honeyed sweetness is balanced on the finish by just a trace of astringency. Drink now-2020.",Riesling
Germany,"Mid-gold in color. Quite a broad bouquet - ripe stone fruit honey, white flowers and a strong stony mineral focus. Sweet, smooth, rich texture yet crisp, refreshing and brimming with lively flavors. Very long, persistent with complex layers that linger on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Inviting nose of intense mellow, yellow fruit with notably focused minerality, some spice and a hint of flowers. Off dry and beautifully balanced by the crisp acidity and generous flavors of delicious, juicy fruit, this is richly textured, yet taut and elegant. Long, persistent, layered finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Delicate lemony color. Fragrant nose of peach and apricot crème pastry, with hints of sherbet and grapefruit and a stony mineral focus. Crisp, racy with a youthful fruit cocktail medley of flavors. Light-bodied but focused and taut. Not hugely concentrated, but well balanced and persistent.",Riesling
Germany,"This youthful auslese is still showing a lot of postfermentation estery characters: it's very perfumed and floral, with such tropical notes as banana and pineapple. The fruit is nearly overwhelming, and the wine is on the sweet side, so it's easy to overlook the underlying minerality, but it's there. Worth cellaring until at least 2015.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine's initial aromatics come across as rather subdued, but give them some time and they begin to unfurl into minerally billows of slate and citrus. This shows the crisp, tight structure of the Saar—it's a tightly coiled spring of green apple and citrus fruits around a core of minerality. Should age through 2015.",Riesling
Germany,"Raimund Prüm's Blue Slate is developing into a consistent performer, marrying hints of ripe fruit—peach or nectarine and melon—with crisp citrusy notes and an underlying minerality that gives it an almost dry finish. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"This medium-bodied Riesling comes across as a bit rich and oily for the kabinett prädikat, but it still offers enjoyable drinking. Hints of dried apricot and orange marmalade shade the aromas, while the flavors are of honeyed stone fruit with some underlying petrol. Finishes clean and minerally.",Riesling
Germany,"Mid-gold in color, featuring broad, layered aromas of ripe yellow stone fruit, ruby red grapefruit and mineral notes. Concentrated flavors prevail across the palate showing crisp citrus fruits, nectarines, white peaches and hints of honey. Racy acidity balances the sweetness, as does its firm, taut texture, which gives the wine focus.",Riesling
Germany,"A pure expression of Mosel Riesling, with touches of flowershop greens, apple and lime. It's sweet but amply structured, with a core of crisp, juicy fruit and a long finish that echoes hints of honey and slate.",Riesling
Germany,"Right now the aromas are a bit tight—even steely—with just modest hints of apple and lime, but the fruit comes to the fore on the palate, exploding with baked apple and spice flavors, balanced by zippy acids. Best from 2011–2015.",Riesling
Germany,"Knyphausen's 2007 Erstes Gewächs wines from Erbach make a stunning couple. The Marcobrunn comes across as slightly cooler, not quite as rich or dense as the Steinmorgen, but possible more elegant. The apple, melon, citrus and mineral notes are delicately interwoven on the long, classy finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Slight hint of sulfur at first, but it blows off and the nose opens to reveal a rich medley of ripe orchard fruit tinged with dried tarragon and savory spice. Crisp, bright and laden with a patchwork of flavors: ripe apples, pears and stone fruit against a backdrop of earthy minerality. Broad yet only medium bodied, with a moderately long finish.",Chardonnay Weissburgunder
Germany,"As with all of the Dr. Loosen wines, this blended kabinett is very fruit-forward and direct. The green apple and lime notes are wonderfully pure and balanced. Drink this light, spritely wine over the next few years.",Riesling
Germany,"Floral elements mark the nose, while the flavors of melon and vanilla also carry some slate-like minerality. It's plump and creamy without being overdone, finishing with a touch of spice.",Riesling
Germany,"Lighter in body and sweeter-tasting than the Abstberg Auslese #70, the regular auslese is almost delicate by comparison, featuring slatey, minerally notes to go alongside hints of honey, lime and orange. Finishes long and citrusy, with a dry mineral edge to help balance the sweetness.",Riesling
Germany,"Plump and rounded rather than racy. Some slightly dieselly aromas bring complexity to the mix of melon, spice and slate, while the mineral-laden finish lingers.",Riesling
Germany,"A succulent style that should have enormous appeal. Honey, pineapple and melon aromas and flavors show off Riesling's fruity side, but the wine's minerality keeps it from seeming overly simple.",Riesling
Germany,"Frankly sweet and almost flabby, with plenty of sugar, petrolly minerality and ripe pear flavors, but this wine lacks the buoyant citrusy zest needed for balance and length.",Riesling
Germany,This is a plump Pinot Gris that does show a bit of its 13.5% alcohol. Pleasant smoke and citrus aromas give way to grapefruit and spice flavors that fade a bit quickly on the finish.,Pinot Gris
Germany,"Rather minerally upfront, with stony scents verging on flinty alongside some floral and citrus notes. It's light in weight but on the sweet side, with slightly confected strawberry flavors giving it an almost candied quality. Aging it 5–8 years should lessen the impact of the sugar.",Riesling
Germany,"Citrus and green apple flavors mark this rather light-bodied auslese. It's crisp, clean and fresh, with tart lemon-lime flavors on the finish and some modestly minerally undercurrents. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Light to medium in body, this is a clean, fresh auslese, not a big, sugary blockbuster. Pineapple and honey aromas lead the way, adding green apple, mint and citrus flavors as the wine crosses the palate. To some, it may seem a bit green and underripe despite the ample residual sugar, while to others it will a welcome respite from many of the overripe ausleses that are actually declassified BAs.",Riesling
Germany,"Ultraripe tropical fruits—even including hints of bananas—dominate this wine's heady aromas. Acids are soft, and alcohol fairly elevated—12.5%—for a wine of this prädikat. There's ample concentration, and the peach and melon flavors linger on the finish. Drink now–2016.",Riesling
Germany,"Classic Mosel nose of fresh blossoms, delicate stone fruit, slate and hints of flint. This is medium sweet, crisp and lively with lots of juicy fruit flavors, notes of acacia honey, white peach and citrus. Nicely taut and focused palate, very minerally with refreshing long finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Mid-gold color. Pronounced aromas of ripe yellow fruits, honey, with hints of warm earth, savory fresh root vegetables and spice. Sweet, richly textured, but refreshingly crisp. Vibrant flavors follow through on the palate showing strong mineral notes. Broad but firm palate and a long lingering lively finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Mid-gold in color, with attractive aromas of ripe stone fruits. Focused by earthy minerality, this is dry and crisp, with abundant fruit in the mouth: peach, apricot, orange peel and spice. Nicely balanced, with a long, minerally finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Sweet, verging on honeyed, this lush wine features plenty of superripe apples balanced by just a dash of citrus and a hint of bitterness on the finish. Could use more complexity.",Riesling
Germany,"Notes of honey and cinnamon combine with a slightly musky spice note to give this sweet auslese added interest. It's round in the mouth without being soft or flabby in the slightest, with lingering notes of baked apple on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Pale gold color wine, with attractive floral nose hints, honey, slate and some obvious sulfur. Racy with a crisp juicy texture, lemony and moderately taut. Sweet with ample citrus and white peach flavors on the palate. Evident minerality on the finish adds complexity. Reasonably long length.",Riesling
Germany,"Pale gold color. Broad and aromatic, showing ripe yellow peach and nectarine, hints of honey, dried herbs and an earthy minerality. Fuller body and weightier on the palate than expected. Slightly loose knit but shows ample ripe stone-fruit flavors that balance sweetness and acidity slightly awkwardly on the palate.",Riesling
Germany,"Slightly closed at first, but slowly opens to reveal ripe stone fruits, hints of white flowers and an earthy minerality. Dry, with racy acidity that is balanced by lots of lively stone-fruit and citrus flavors. Palate is nicely taut and elegant. Moderately long, juicy finish.",Riesling
Germany,"At 9.5% alcohol and with plenty of residual sugar, this is rather broad, but it still boasts excellent intensity and complexity. Aromas of wet slate speak to the wine's origins, mixing easily with hints of clover leaf, apple, melon and lime. Ends citrusy, but also on a slightly chalky note.",Riesling
Germany,"Much lighter in weight than many Pinot Gris on the market, this is a pretty, fruit-driven rendering of the variety, blending tropical fruit with ripe apples and hints of pink grapefruit. It's crisp and clean on the finish.",Pinot Gris
Germany,"A solid effort from a huge commercial enterprise, this wine offers typical floral notes on the nose and straightforward flavors of baked apple, dried spices and citrus on the palate. It's medium-bodied and fresh, with some decent length on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Quite ripe and precise stone fruit aromas with interesting hints of minerality. Refreshingly crisp with balanced sweetness. Ample youthful, juicy fruits dance across the palate. Moderate intensity of flavor, zesty texture and a moderately long finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Prevailing lemony, citrus-cocktail aromas with hints of almond macaroons. Though medium sweet, it is lip-smackingly crisp and racy, with zesty citrus flavors following through on the palate. Moderately intense and reasonably taut, if a little austere.",Riesling
Germany,"The restrained nose shows some white peach notes, lees and stony minerality. This is complex, layered and persistent across the palate, opening up to ample stone fruit flavors, earthy notes, dried herbs and spice. Crisp, with sweetness, moderately concentrated flavors and a rich texture all in balance, if a little loose knit on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This boasts a pretty nose of peach, honeysuckle blossom, tangerine and cantaloupe and stony minerality. Lively, juicy texture with a medley of zesty citrus fruit, and fresh stone-fruit flavors. Hints of honey and blossoms and a lingering minerality linger on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Pale gold color, this has a rather reduced nose at first that slowly gives way to ripe stone fruit aromas and an earthy, savory note. Not very complex, but displays vibrant citrus and stone-fruit flavors that impart a pleasant tingle to the midpalate. Fairly light-bodied and easy drinking, with a moderate fruity finish.",Riesling
Germany,"A creamy-textured, medium-bodied kabinett, Haart's 2007 features some leesy complexity upfront, then focused pineapple fruit on the midpalate. Finishes long, with citrus and mineral underpinnings that balance the wine's delicate sweetness. Now-2015.",Riesling
Germany,"Shows a weaker side of the 2006 vintage, with an overly broad mouthfeel and a certain lack of precision, but still boasts ripe apple and melon flavors.",Riesling
Germany,"Frankly sweet, and somewhat oily in texture, this is low in alcohol (7.5%) but high in sugar and ripeness, bringing tropical fruits like mango and papaya to mind.",Riesling
Germany,"Despite weighing in at 12% alcohol, this seems light in body and sweet in style, with honeyed pineapple aromas and flavors of apple skin and lime. Finishes stridently, with a dusty texture.",Riesling
Germany,"Light and lean in style, maybe more classic than Johannishof's G bottling from the same vineyard, but also less enjoyable. Lime sherbet and quince form the crisp backbone, tinged with a hint of slightly confected strawberries.",Riesling
Germany,"Earthy on the nose, with savory aromas, fern fronds and ultraripe yellow fruit. This is dry and racy—almost a little tart—showing moderately intense flavors of ripe melons, Golden Delicious apples and Bosc pears. A little skeletal for the crispness but juicy and refreshing, with a long and savory earthy finish.",Pinot Blanc
Germany,"On the drier side for an auslese, with the alcohol reaching 10%, this wine features hints of apricot and pineapple marmalade, but there are also less pristine earthy, fungal notes that some may read as complex while others may find them slightly dirty. Crisp and linear on the finish. Drink now–2015.",Riesling
Germany,"Pale to mid-gold in color with a heady nose of exotic spice, rose water and floral blossoms with a hint of smoke. Round and warming on the palate. Sweet yet fresh and juicy with moderate intensity of citrus and stone fruit flavors. Some savory earthy notes on a moderately long finish.",Gewürztraminer
Germany,"Pale lemony color. Classic Mosel nose of stone, slate, white peach and flower blossoms. Vibrant and crisp, balancing the sweetness on the palate and resulting in a wine with a juicy texture and moderate intensity, turning racy on the finish. Not overly complex, but refined.",Riesling
Germany,"Mid-gold in color, this has a pronounced classic Gewürztraminer nose of lychee, rose petals, spice and ripe stone fruit with notes of earthy minerality. Sweet and richly textured, round mouthfeel with moderately intense flavors similar to nose with an added note of stem ginger and smoky spice on the finish.",Gewürztraminer
Germany,"Shows wonderful purity of fruit—green apple and lime, perhaps a touch of flower shop greens—and impreccable balance, being light in body, off dry, crisp and refreshing. Delicious.",Riesling
Germany,"There's an appealing nose of ripe yellow stone fruit, spice and an earthy minerality. Medium-sweet with a lovely rich texture, fleshy, but well balanced by the refreshing acidity. Smooth and broad across the palate, showing strong flavor intensity that lingers. Long, with a persistent layered, minerally finish.",Gewürztraminer
Germany,"With its delicate aromas of flowers, fresh greens and a hint of mint, you might expect this to be a light, delicate wine. But it's broad and rather sweet, marked by flavors of ripe apples and vanilla. It comes across a bit soft on the finish, but luscious.",Riesling
Germany,"Sweet and broad, with obvious spice, lychee and rose-petal aromatics but a disappointing lack of follow-through on the finish. It's good, but could use more vibrance and length.",Gewürztraminer
Germany,"Starts off a little sluggish, offering up hints of roasted sweet corn on the nose, but those aromas soon give way to scents of pineapple and dried apples. It's soft in the mouth, verging on flabby, but has some charming flavors of apple and spiced pear that make it enjoyable as a chilled apéritif. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"The subtle nose features a medley of citrus fruits. Zesty lemon, grapefruit and tangerine flavors persist across the palate. Juicy and refreshing with an attractive midpalate creaminess adding weight and complexity. Smooth and long, with a nice mineral kick on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Pale gold in color, with a fairly pronounced nose of orange citrus rind, dried herbs, pear drops and lime sherbet. Medium sweet and fruity, not terribly complex but nicely juicy and well balanced with an attractive spicy kick on the finish. Youthful, refreshing and easy-drinking.",Gewürztraminer
Germany,"At 13.5% alcohol, this is pretty ripe Riesling, broad in the mouth and almost oily in texture. Hints of honey and ripe pear mark the nose, but this wine is more about minerally extract than fruit. Turns spicy on the mouthcoating finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Ripe nose of peach, apricot and honey with some petrol. This is sweet yet refreshing, with moderately concentrated ripe flavors. Smooth texture across the palate, attractive mineral notes and some spice on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"The appealing nose of lemony-lime aromas features a hint of honey. This medium-sweet wine with a gripping crispness is fairly light-bodied and slightly loose-knit, but refreshing, with moderately intense flavors of citrus cocktail. A nice earthy kick chimes in on the finish.",Scheurebe
Germany,"Presents an admirable blend of melon, lime, slate, mint and petrol, folding in apple notes on the palate. This is fairly sweet—close to unctuous—in style, while remaining fresh and fruit-driven from start to finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This plump, sweet auslese epitomizes the Pauly Bergweiler style. Honeydew and orange aromas and flavors are ripe and succulent—delicious in an easygoing way—but lack the complexity and extra sizzle to make the wine truly special.",Riesling
Germany,"Not a stereotypical fruity Riesling, the 2009 Qvinterra features plenty of savory, umami-like notes of broth and brine to go along with hints of sun-warmed peaches. It's medium bodied, with a long, velvety-textured finish unusual for a white wine. Intriguing.",Riesling
Germany,"Medium-gold in color, with a pronounced nose of ripe yellow peach and nectarine and hints of spice and minerality. Crisp, with juicy, sweet, ultraripe yellow fruit flavors following on the palate, but quite loose-knit texture. Simple easy-drinking.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts off with an almost indescribable note of petrichor, then develops more apple, citrus and even a hint of peachy ripeness. It's plump and medium in body, with lovely balance to the off-dry finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine starts off a bit funky and earthy on the nose, but opens up to reveal more floral and lime-like scents. At 13% alcohol, it's medium bodied and impressively dry tasting, with lime blossom and pineapple fruit balanced by crisp acids. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Light nose, not showing much intensity on this pale gold Riesling. Slightly resinous, showing more on the palate with ripe stone-fruit flavors, hints of melon and pineapple. Quite sweet and rich, with slightly syrupy texture. Pleasing but straightforward and simple.",Riesling
Germany,"Pale gold in color. The savory, earthy nose shows dried herbs and a hint of honey. This is off-dry, but very well balanced by crisp acidity, leaving it refreshing across the palate. Moderately intense juicy citrus, cantaloupe and nectarine flavors. A little loose knit and simple on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Willi Haag's 2007 spätlese from the Juffer boasts a high-class mélange of petrol and slate, flowers and citrus. It's medium in body, with surprisingly restrained fruit on the palate, finishing with just a touch of phenolic bitterness.",Riesling
Germany,"Released in the U.S. a bit later than most German wines, Raimund Prüm's 2006 Würzgarten kabinett remains primary and fresh, filling the room with aromas of green apple, lime and slate. It's medium in body (9% alcohol) and slightly creamy in texture, with an off-dry finish marked by hints of lime zest.",Riesling
Germany,"A bit thin in texture, with wan apple and citrus flavors.",Pinot Gris
Germany,"This slate selection from Kendermanns is a pleasant surprise, speaking of its origins in the smoky, wet slate aromas and stony flavors couched in layers of white peach, melon and hints of honey. Despite a considerable 12.5% alcohol, it seems light and fresh, ending on notes of citrus and melon. Imported by Reh Kendermann GmbH Weinkellerei.",Riesling
Germany,"An interesting, characterful kabinett, with scents of smoke and scorched oil that mingle with lime and apple notes. On the palate, it delivers plenty of zippy citrus flavors, wrapped in a confounding veil of smoke and tar. Might prove better in time; give it 3–4 years of cellaring.",Riesling
Germany,"Kicks off with intensely petrol-like aromas and hints of vegetable oil rather than overt fruitiness, then develops flavors of honey, marmalade and spice on the palate. It's a rich, viscous wine that finishes very sweet—almost cloying—on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine boasts intense and pure aromas of pear and pineapple, then adds notes of melon and dried spices on the palate. Medium in body and slightly sweet, with a short, crisp finish. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"This plump, medium-bodied kabinett seems destined for early maturity, as it relies on a touch of unreleased CO2 to give it liveliness. Drink it young while it's still fresh, and before the bold apple, pear and citrus flavors fade.",Riesling
Germany,"Intensely diesel-like on the nose, almost to the point of nuttiness, then full-bodied, broad and muscular on the palate, delivering flavors of oranges and wet stones. It's drier than many spätlesen, and while it may lack a bit of raciness and elgance, it makes up for it with sheer power.",Riesling
Germany,"This fresh, medium-bodied Riesling is clean and fruity, combining flavors of ripe pears and white peaches with hints of apple and slate. Imported by Classical Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"On first glance, this wine comes across as too simple and sweet. But give it some time and a spicy, slatey-minerally compenent emerges, providing balance and complexity to the ripe pear flavors. An estate that seems to be undergoing a bit of a resurgence. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Round and medium-bodied, this relatively low-acid Riesling is soft and easy to drink. Mineral and spice notes accent ripe pear and melon flavors. Drink now. Imported by Loosen Bros. USA.",Riesling
Germany,"Medium in body—and even a bit oily in texture—this amply ripened wine boasts smoky, pungent aromas that veer toward green apple and lime after some airing. It's a bit heavy, but flavorful. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Founded in 1794, Deinhard is an old merchant house—what the French would call a négociant—that markets a wide array of wines. The company's 1808 price list offered 89 different Rhine and Mosel wines, but that's been at least somewhat shortened in recent years. No, it's not that intense, nor does it show a lot of minerality, but this wine ably shows off Mosel Riesling's array of fruity, off-dry flavors, ranging from peach and pear to apple, pineapple and lime. Crisp and clean on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Lacks the layered intensity that the 2003 version of this wine showed at this stage, but still delivers stony, minerally aromas and prototypical flavors of green apples and fresh limes. Light in body, but clean and wonderfuly refreshing on the finish. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"This seems a bit simple and confected for an Erstes Gewächs offering, with superripe, fruity aromas and flavors of apple, melon and lime. It's still a nice wine, medium-bodied and cleanly made, just lacking the minerality and complexity you'd hope for at this level.",Riesling
Germany,"Relatively light in weight for the Rheingau, with modest pineapple and fern aromas on the nose. Tart and flavorful on the palate, marrying pineapple and green apple flavors that finish crisp and dry. Imported by Schmitt-Sohne Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"This is a decidedly nonfruity Riesling, marked instead by aromas of petrol and featuring flavors of crushed stone, canola oil and lime. It's relatively light in body and close to dry, finishing long and citrusy. Try it with a seafood salad or smoked trout.",Riesling
Germany,"Breuer's entry-level wine isn't cheap, but it's also pretty good, marrying stony, minty scents with flavors of lime, fresh herbs and wet stones. It's light in body for such an alcoholic Rheingau Riesling, with a clean, fresh finish. Imported by Classical Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"Still a bit sulfury, but otherwise correct, with melon, pear and spice flavors, lithe body and a clean, short finish. Should be better in another year or two. Imported by Palm Bay Imports.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts with slate and lime aromas, adding in modest apple notes on the medium-weight palate. Clean and crisp, just lacks a bit of distinction. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Light and very crisp, this wine even boasts hints of retained carbon dioxide to further enliven its mouthfeel. Lime and flint-smoke scents yield to citrusy, stony flavors. Would work well as an apéritif. Imported by Classical Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"Seems slightly disjointed, with pungent diesel aromas on one hand and sweet-tart melon and pear flavors on the other. It's atypically broad in the mouth for Riesling, almost fat, yet closes on a tangy, earthy note. Imported by Schmitt-Sohne Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Make no mistake—this is full-bodied, but it carries its 14.5% alcohol without any sign of warmth, just mouthcoating layers of flavor. Petrol and oily notes mark the nose and palate, but there's enough apple-y fruit and dried-spice notes to achieve complexity and balance. Dry essence of Riesling.",Riesling
Germany,"A soft, fruity wine, Knyphausen's entry-level Riesling has hints of flowers on the nose, then delivers weighty pear and melon flavors. Off-dry. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"The fruit seems rather restrained in this medium-bodied Riesling. Instead, the emphasis is on slatey, minerally scents, backed by soft apple and citrus flavors. Imported by Chapin Cellars.",Riesling
Germany,"Words hardly do this wine justice. It's unctuous almost beyond the point of being wine—offering a mèlange of dried fruits and honey that ooze over every taste bud, filling the pores of your mouth and then releasing sugar and flavor for minutes afterward. And the aromas aren't too shabby either, giving up intense scents of dried apricots and orange marmalade, tinged with tea-like notes that add a sense of lightness and complexity.",Riesling
Germany,"Reasonably priced for an eiswein, this immensely thick, oily offering coats the palate with intense sweetness, but also succulent flavors of flower syrup, ultraripe pears and apricots. Candied orange notes linger forever on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine's intense aromas of honey, oranges and tea seem almost a little roasted or caramelized, but on the palate the flavors are brilliantly defined and focused by vibrant acidity that brighten the bold citrus and honey notes. A  rich and viscous mouthfeel, yet miraculously crisp at the same time; the acids keep the finish echoing in your mouth for a long, long time.",Riesling
Germany,"What balance! This wine's considerable sweetness is admirably buffered by ample acidity, while low alcohol adds to the impression of lightness and ease. This structural balance is complemented by the way slaty-minerally aromas play off bright tangerine and peach flavors, ending seamlessly, crisp and long. Delicious now, but should easily age 20 years.",Riesling
Germany,"Insanely priced, but if you love ultrasticky dessert wines, this is one you'll want to try at least once. Shows the merest hint of volatility on the nose, but also striking floral and mineral components. Broad and viscous on the palate, with intensely honeyed flavors of dried apricots and orange marmalade that last a long, long time. Should age virtually forever.",Riesling
Germany,"On the full-bodied side, but the combined weight of sugar and alcohol is ably balanced by bountiful acids. Floral notes lead off the nose, followed by hints of pineapple and spice, then dried apricots and candied fruit kick in on the palate. Clean on the finish, not overly sweet or cloying.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine lacks the richness and texture of Knipser's Im Großen Garten bottling, but more than makes up for it with complex notes of spring flowers, bergamot, spice and mineral. Long and crisp on the finish, with potential to possibly improve up to 10 years.",Riesling
Germany,"Strikes a lovely balance between fruit and minerality, marrying ripe apple and orangey citrus notes with hints of petrol or diesel. Reasonably full-bodied, turning crisp and zesty on the spice-inflected finish. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Is this a breakout year for Nik Weis? Never before have I found his range of wines so compelling, and this spätlese is just one example. Yes, it's still marked by heavy leesy notes on the nose, but the fruit is plump and succulent on the palate, mixing melon and apple notes with a heavy dose of spice and mineral.",Riesling
Germany,"It's rare to see older vintages of German wines released straight from the estate cellars, so if you haven't had the chance to sample older German dessert wines, this may be worth a try. It's pretty darn good, too, with lovely clover blossom and honey scents leading into dried apricot and juicy pineapple flavors. Don't expect a thick, syrupy wine—this has a light touch and impeccable balance that might best be paired with foie gras, fresh fruit or mild cheeses rather than full-blown dessert. Reasonably priced, considering the prädikat and age.",Riesling
Germany,"Like virtually all St. Urbans-Hof wines, this one starts off a bit sulfury, but the quality of the wine underneath is readily apparent, from its scents of slate and apple to flavors of white peach and melon. It's generous in fruit, yet restrained in texture, featuring an almost austere minerality that balances the wine's residual sugar. Cool and stony on the finish, this wine has a long future ahead of it.",Riesling
Germany,"Reasonably priced for a Riesling of this quality, this off-dry wine is filled with spiced baked apple flavors. Touches of petrol and stone dust impart a sense of minerality, while the finish is long and mouthwatering.",Riesling
Germany,"Like all of the Weil wines, even this entry-level effort places an emphasis on ripeness. Hints of smoke and diesel add complexity to the nose, while on the palate it's broad and slightly off-dry, with sun-drenched flavors of nectarine and melon that coat the mouth on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This medium-bodied spätlese has a firm spine of acidity to help keep its shape through potentially decades of aging. Apple, clove and melon fruit is buttressed by layers of minerals and spice and a long, crisp finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Rich and unctuous, but not a simple fruit-bomb of concentrated fruit, there's also great minerality and some kerosene. Apple, peach kernel and baking spice flavors end on a honeyed note.",Riesling
Germany,"A step up from the 2003 offerings from this estate, with clean, vibrant aromas of vanilla, melons and white peaches. Flavors are similar, with just enough citrus to balance the sweetness. It's plump, yet spry and light on its feet—an attractive combination.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts with beautifully defined aromas of green apple and lime, then adds tangerine flavors to the mix on the palate. It's not heavy, but it's not light, either, deftly balancing acid, alcohol and sugar. Long and minerally on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This estate has been turning out better and better wines nearly every year, and this may be its best yet. A fabulous bouquet of honeyed slate, green apples and limes is followed by flavors that are sweet yet balanced, with great freshness and racy acidity. Finishes long and mouthwatering. Not only about power, there's also elegance to spare.",Riesling
Germany,"Seems a bit simple at first, mounding up fruity scents of apple, pineapple and pear. But give it some time to develop and it adds complex mineral and spice nuances. The wine is fairly rich and full-bodied, but the sweetness is balanced by crisp acids. Long in the finish and packed with dry mineral notes.",Riesling
Germany,"Plump and succulent, this is a deceptively easy wine. Ripe apple, pear and melon flavors make it seem simple, but underneath the flesh is a spine of bright acids and slatey minerality. Zesty lime and ripe orange notes give length to the crisp, lingering finish. Both this wine and the auslese are great.",Riesling
Germany,"A bit sulfury on the nose, but even through that veil it's possible to discern greatness. Citrus, melon and pear notes shine through, picking up mineral notes on the long finish, while the texture is plump but with elegant underlying structure. Drink 2010–2020.",Riesling
Germany,"Rock hounds will adore this wine, which shows off the dry minerality of the Abstberg. Crushed stone, spice and melon scents are fleshed out and embellished on the palate by honeyed notes of pineapple and dried fruit. Persistent citrus, honey and mineral notes linger elegantly on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine pleases from start to finish, beginning with mouthwatering aromas of zesty limes and green apples and then adding plump, mouthfilling flavors of melon. Ends long, with pepper, spice and mineral notes.",Riesling
Germany,"It's stony and minerally on the nose, but also boasts vivid pear, melon and green-apple scents. The flavors verge on tropical, mixing ripe pear and melon notes with underpinnings of tangerine. It's all wrapped in a plump, succulent texture and features a long, lipsmacking finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This delicate wine is waif-like and virtually ephemeral on the nose, with subtle scents of mineral, fresh greens, citrus and apple. In the mouth, it shows similar finesse, striking a fine balance between sweetness and tart green-apple and lime flavors. Finishes long, accented by bright citrus notes.",Riesling
Germany,"A fairly big, broad-shouldered wine that displays ripe baked apple and spice scents, but also intense minerality. The slightly oily texture comes off like creamy molten rock, finishing long and mostly dry, with lingering slatey notes.",Riesling
Germany,"A rich, unctuous style of auslese, with broad, sweet flavors of poached apple and pear, accented by hints of dried apricots and spice. This is a bit on the sticky side but may come into better balance over time.",Riesling
Germany,"Relatively round and lush for a dry German Riesling, with pronounced ripeness and texture. A hint of diesel marks the bouquet, followed by scents of superripe apples, honey and dried apricot, while the flavors add notes of mineral and spice. A long, spice-driven finish completes the package.",Riesling
Germany,"If there is any complaint at all to be made about this wine, it's that it is too easy to drink. Succulent, ripe, honeyed fruit balanced by just enough acidity slips down without any edginess, yet the flavors still linger nicely on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"From the family's estate holdings in the Saar, this is a steely, minerally wine, but the ripeness of the vintage has given it a saber's heft rather than the more typical rapier-like weight. A bit austere, but long, dry and minerally on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Relatively high in alcohol and dark in color, this is a kabinett that doesn't quite fit the mold, yet still provides a pleasurable experience. Minerally, dieselly notes on the nose are matched by baked apple scents, while the flavors turn toward honeyed stones and sweet corn. It's creamy in texture, rich and off-dry.",Riesling
Germany,"Qualitatively on a par with the fine 2001, but in a plumper, sweeter style, with honeyed apple and pineapple aromas and flavors. A hint of bitter citrus pith on the finish provides a counterweight to all of the sweet fruit.",Riesling
Germany,"Fairly priced for a Nahe Riesling, the Schloss Wallhausen spätlese offers penetrating scents of lime and minerals, garnished with touches of flowers and green apple. Despite its plumpness in the mouth, there's an almost austere quality to the minerality, which is only slightly buffered by sweet apple and citrus flavors. Picks up the slightest hint of bitterness on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Sweet and full-bodied, this is packed with apple, pear and quince flavors. Initial leesy notes slowly blow off, so decant prior to serving, or age 5–7 years. This is lush rather than classically racy, but still very enjoyable.",Riesling
Germany,"The style at Pauly-Bergweiler leans toward ultraripe, and this wine is no exception, boasting sweet, lush flavors of honeyed melons and pears that verge on fatness. Thankfully, there's a touch of unreleased CO2 to help provide freshness and a just a hint of grapefruit on the finish—enough to give the wine some focus.",Riesling
Germany,"In the house style, this is rather lush and sweet for its prädikat. Candied pineapple notes anchor the bouquet, lightly garnished with hints of crushed stone. Flavors continue along the same theme, adding notes of tropical fruit and superripe pears. Approachable now; it should firm up a little with age.",Riesling
Germany,"Rather fruit-driven and sweet, with dried fruit and apple shadings on the nose, and apple, melon and citrus flavors. It's medium-bodied, and ends with more melon flavors and a hint of slate.",Riesling
Germany,"Considerably heftier than the light-bodied 2004 version, and a better wine for the extra weight, with baked apple, melon and spice notes amply filling out this wine's medium body. Finishes long, picking up a dusting of cinnamon and crushed stone.",Riesling
Germany,"Although somewhat pricy, this is a very good wine, marrying a minerally, crushed-stone character with ripe tree fruits. Round and slightly honeyed peach and apple flavors are a treat, backed by citrusy notes that extend through the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"From the Wormser Liebfrauenstift-Kirchenstück, this dry Riesling boasts a clean, crystalline quality to its pear, apple and melon flavors. Scents of stone dust enhance that aspect of the wine, which follows through on the minerally finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Fresh and minty on the nose, with restrained pear and melon notes, this medium-bodied kabinett is firmly tart and acidic on the palate, with balanced sweet-sour flavors. Turns slightly chalky on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"A touch drier than the Gold label Impulse Riesling previously reviewed, this wine has a fine, almost filigreed bouquet of finely intertwined lime and mineral notes accented by green plum. Lean and elegant, with a crisp finish and good length.",Riesling
Germany,"Unique in character, this wine features powerful white pepper and spice drop notes layered over white peach and melon flavors. It's rather big and round in the mouth, but it also has a bit of a hole in the midpalate. Turns peppery and spicy on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Relatively plump and succulent for a “Dry Riesling”, with honeyed, musky notes that accent ripe peach and dusty mineral flavors. Not quite dry on the finish, but powered by crisp acidity.",Riesling
Germany,"This hard, stony-textured wine will be tough to warm up to for some, while rock-heads will extol its minerally virtues. Hints of lime and green plum keep it from being too austere, while it finishes cool and long.",Riesling
Germany,"Perfumed and floral on the nose, but there's also a fair degree of crushed stone buffered by hints of green apple and citrus. Flavors are strongly floral and mineral, then finish stony and dry.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts off with beautiful scents of minerals, dried spices and a hint of peach, but not quite as attractive on the palate, where it seems heavy at times despite some unreleased CO2. Then it turns tangy-tart on the finish. This youthful wine comes across as a bit disjointed; hopefully, that will improve over the next few months in bottle and this rating will look conservative.",Riesling
Germany,"It's an intriguing idea to blend fruit from the Rhine and the Mosel, theoretically balancing the best qualities of each. Astute tasters will catch a little bit of that in this wine, with darker spice notes playing against brighter floral nuances. The result is a pleasant if rather generic Riesling that finishes with soft pear and melon fruit.",Riesling
Germany,"A plump, off-dry Riesling imported in relatively large quantities (30,000 cases), this is a notable reintroduction to the grape variety. Has basic Mosel characteristics of green apple and lime aromas and flavors. There's even a soft, slightly mineral finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This citrusy wine is a bit of a one-note wonder, but it performs that note well, featuring strident lime aromas and a zippy, dry finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Light and dry, with scents of limes, fresh ferns and green apple. Flavors of green apple and citrus finish crisp and clean.",Riesling
Germany,"Smells solid, showing hints of honey and melon layered over some stony notes, but turns dull and earthy on the palate, then roughly acidic on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,There's some mossy tones under the fresh pear fruit along with a slight spritz that keeps everything lively. Pretty lemon and grapefruit notes show through on the (slightly tart) finish. Drink now.,Riesling
Germany,"Light and airy, with petroleum, verbena and spring flower scents and a medium finish with nice gravel and lemon notes. Not a trace of sweetness. Try with raw clams. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"A medium-bodied, slightly chunky Riesling, this lacks the elegance and finesse of the best Mosel wines, but still manages a tasty balance of sweet and tart, with apple, citrus and earthy notes all combining on the palate.",Riesling
Germany,"The scents of this wine speak indubitably of its place, running the gamut of classic descriptors from apple and lime to honey and slate. It's dry and lithe on the palate, combining citrus and crushed-stone flavors, and finishing crisp and clean.",Riesling
Germany,"Importer Rudi Wiest with the help of Robert Eymael has found a fruity, off-dry Riesling at a great price. The melon, spice and citrus flavors are delivered via a palate that's a little broad, but finish clean. With a little more zip, this would be even better.",Riesling
Germany,"The “black cat” Riesling I remember from my childhood rides again, with modest green apple notes accented by bits of earth and citrus. It's off dry and soft, yet with a slightly sour edge to the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Aromas are redolent of a candy store—cotton candy, watermelon sours and candied apples. The palate is a sharp contrast, dry, austere and a bit thin. A few years in the cellar will help tame the piercing acidity.",Riesling
Germany,"Opens with exotic notes of musk and summer jasmine, backed up by scents of tangerine. The dry palate is light and more straightforward, wrapping up with a short burst of lemon peel.",Riesling
Germany,"Light and pretty on the nose, with carnations, lemon and just a hint of candied ginger in the background. A tad watery in the mouth, with a short citrus peel aftertaste. Drink up.",Silvaner
Germany,"Baking scents have the upper hand here, along with a sprinkling of fresh citrus tones that glide through to the finish on a slick of biting acidity. Try with chips & dip. Drink up.",Riesling
Germany,"There's definitely something funky going on though the nose is not unappealing, with some nice apricot overtones. Crisp and lightweight, it turns a bit sharp at the end.",Riesling
Germany,"Sweet and broad, this eiswein displays a distinctly sour edge to its flavors, which proved offputting to this taster.",Gewürztraminer
Germany,"Honey, cream and watermelon notes make for a likable opening. The crisp, citrusy palate is straightforward, with just a hint of softness. Medium lime and fresia finish. Drink now.",Silvaner
Germany,"Dry and a bit sharp, this Rheinhessen trocken has some funky low notes under its peach and pear fruit. It's light on its feet and suitable for a raw bar. Drink up.",Riesling
Germany,"Simple but pleasant sipper, with understated aromas of talcum powder, fresh grapes and quince. Finishes light, peachy and clean. A good companion for sushi. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"While the scents are decadent—honey, ginger and candied pineapple—the achingly dry palate makes a tart impression. Try with oysters. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"This white from the Franken region of Germany shows more aromatic intensity than your typical Silvaner, but there's a candied edge here that's a bit offputting. It's crisp in the mouth, with good body and some nice apple notes that linger. Drink now.",Silvaner
Germany,"A bit bland, with some maraschino cherry character along with faint melon rind notes. There's good acidity in the mouth but the short finish of spiced pear leaves behind a soft, slightly muddled impression.",Silvaner
Germany,"The confectionary notes here are a bit over-the-top, with bubblegum and candied pineapple leading into candied ginger in the mouth. It's crisp and light-to-medium-bodied, with a short, apricot finish. Drink up.",Silvaner
Germany,"The nose lacks punch, offering only faint notes of melon and white flowers while the crisp, fairly dry palate sails by on fleeting notes of white raspberry and pomelo. Not one for aging.",Riesling
Germany,"Despite the name, this wine is a bit done up aromatically; it's austere and lacking in fruit with just a shy note of lemon zest to soften things. Ultracrisp and dry in the mouth, it has a clean citrusy finish. Drink up.",Riesling
Germany,"To judge by the codes on the label, this Best Buy is from the same bottler who did Rudi Wiest's 2007 Mosel River. This is slightly lighter in weight, with simple apple and citrus flavors tinged with petrol. Off-dry, but clean and fresh on the finish. A wine to drink now and over the next few months.",Riesling
Germany,"A dry, stony, somewhat neutral wine, marked by crisp acids and vaguely apple-y fruit. The crispnesss and austerity would make it a fine foil for creamy or oily fish dishes.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts off with scents of slate, pineapple and vanilla, then delivers apple, melon and lime sherbet flavors. It's off-dry, light in body, and easy enough to drink now and over the next six months or so.",Riesling
Germany,"At 250,000 cases imported, this has to be one of the biggest brands of Riesling on the market. The modern packaging contains a cleanly made, off-dry wine with bright herb and apple notes and a citrusy finish—it's easy to see its mass appeal. Drink now. Imported by Schmitt-Sohne Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"This plump, creamy-textured Riesling shows plenty of flattering peach and lime fruit, but also enough mint and slate that it avoids being simply fruity. Balanced toward the dry side of the Riesling spectrum, so it should prove versatile at the table.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine's aromas of baked apple, honey, cinnamon and brown sugar are immediately attractive, and in the mouth it doesn't disappoint. It's broad and mouthfilling but avoids heaviness, finishing long, with hints of orange rind.",Riesling
Germany,"Broad in the mouth and rather burly, this nearly dry Riesling offers minerally, spice-driven aromas and flavors. A touch of honeyed richness on the palate rounds it out, but this is not a stereotypical fruity Riesling despite the mouthwatering finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine has balanced acidity, but think of it as a baby auslese because the residual sugar level is quite high and there is some suggestion of botrytis. Aromas and flavors are tinged with dried apricots and honey, rounded out by ripe peaches and given shape by fresh limes. Drink now–2020.",Riesling
Germany,"Despite this wine's considerable sweetness, it features a balanced blend of minerality and fruit. Pear and slate notes mark the nose and palate, finishing soft and round. An easy-drinking kabinett for near-term consumption.",Riesling
Germany,"Impressive for its minerality, this wine offers up aromas of petrol, honey and slate rather than the fruit-driven notes of many Rieslings. In the mouth, it's like drinking liquid rocks with just enough honey to help the minerals slide down smoothly, lingering sweetly on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"In really warm years like 2006, wines from the cool Saar valley often excel. This offering shows crisp, refreshing acidity to balance its residual sugar and classic flavors of green apple, lime and pineapple. Under it all is a firm foundation of slate-driven minerality and a fine, linear structure.",Riesling
Germany,"In a departure from Mosel stereotypes, this wine is missing the floral fragrance and vivacity so typical of the region. But it remains impressive, offering plenty of concentration and density, hugely mineral aromas and flavors that call to mind molten rocks and even an oily texture and viscous finish. How it will age is impossible to predict, so drink it over the next 2–3 years.",Riesling
Germany,"From Trittenheim's most famous vineyard, this is a beautifully balanced, harmonious wine that balances hints of petrol and slate with flavors of honeyed peaches, all while remaining light and spry on the palate.",Riesling
Germany,"This fruit-driven wine lacks a touch of minerality but features admirably pure, focused notes of perfectly ripe apples, pineapple and citrus. It's a sweet, medium-bodied spätlese that's plump and succulent, delicious sipped on its own on a warm summer evening. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",Riesling
Germany,"The Pauly Bergweiler style leans toward ripe and sweet, but this bottling also shows plenty of acidity. Honeyed orange and pineapple flavors are concentrated and rich, balanced by hints of petrol, slate and peppery spice.",Riesling
Germany,"A plump, medium-bodied Riesling, this shows the ripeness of the vintage in its ample alcohol (11.5%) and remaining residual sweetness, but doesn't seem heavy or overdone. Honeyed stone fruit and melon are buoyed by some slate-driven minerality while the finish remains succulent and fresh.",Riesling
Germany,"A medium-bodied, dry Silvaner, with modestly earthy, minerally and grapefruity aromas and citrus and mineral flavors. It finishes clean and fresh, with only 11% alcohol. Serve as an apéritif, alone or with passed hors d'oeuvres.",Silvaner
Germany,"For this wine's modest reported alcohol level (8%), it doesn't come across as being overly sweet, but boasts a broad, fullish mouthfeel. Tropical fruit—mango—marries easily with peach and lime flavors and a touch of honey. Turns tart on the finish, adding more lime to the flavorful mix.",Riesling
Germany,"Light in weight despite 9.5% alcohol, this is a refreshingly off-dry Riesling with a mouthwatering finish. Green apple, lime and mineral notes round out the typical flavor profile.",Riesling
Germany,"A solid value in German Riesling that just misses out being a Best Buy, this wine features aromas of honey-drizzled baked apples with cinnamon and lemon juice, a refreshingly light feel on the palate and an ultraclean, persistent finish with undertones of ripe melon. Drink now–2015.",Riesling
Germany,"Raumland's Marie-Luise is a blanc de noirs of 100% Pinot Noir that comes across as toasty and nutty on the nose and palate, without obvious red-berry fruitiness or the earthy, sous-bois complexity of the variety. That said, it is medium in body and does make for a nice glass of bottle-matured sparkling.",Sparkling Blend
Germany,"Supersweet and cloying, with one-dimensional honey and barley-sugar aromas and flavors. Disappointing.",Riesling
Germany,"With 12% alcohol, you might expect this to be on the dry side, but it's not. Instead, it's sweet and oily, with ripe apple, pear and peach fruit vying with notes of crushed stone. Lingers a bit stickily on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"The flight of Rheingau dessert wines this appeared in was almost universally disappointing. Like most of the others, this showed some excessively earthy aromas and flavors, although it did possess ample sweetness and attractive musk and spice notes.",Riesling
Germany,"Nearly dry in style, this wine starts off with primary fruit aromas of ripe apples, slightly underripe peaches and a touch of grapefruit, then delivers stonier, more minerally flavors on the palate. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",Riesling
Germany,"Fresh and floral on the nose, this is a clean, zesty example of kabinett, the type that was difficult to craft in 2006. Citrus and green apple flavors are true to type, with hints of fresh greens and spring flowers adding a bit of complexity.",Riesling
Germany,"From a little-seen village of the Middle Mosel, this is a solid effort. It's light in weight and linear in structure, without the mouthcoating ripeness seen in many 2006s, but imbued with petrol and mineral notes that highlight green apple and citrus flavors.",Riesling
Germany,"This medium-bodied Riesling comes across as a bit rich and oily for the kabinett prädikat, but it still offers enjoyable drinking. Hints of dried apricot and orange marmalade shade the aromas, while the flavors are of honeyed stone fruit with some underlying petrol. Finishes clean and minerally.",Riesling
Germany,"Rather minerally upfront, with stony scents verging on flinty alongside some floral and citrus notes. It's light in weight but on the sweet side, with slightly confected strawberry flavors giving it an almost candied quality. Aging it 5–8 years should lessen the impact of the sugar.",Riesling
Germany,"A solid effort from a huge commercial enterprise, this wine offers typical floral notes on the nose and straightforward flavors of baked apple, dried spices and citrus on the palate. It's medium-bodied and fresh, with some decent length on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Frankly sweet, and somewhat oily in texture, this is low in alcohol (7.5%) but high in sugar and ripeness, bringing tropical fruits like mango and papaya to mind.",Riesling
Germany,"Despite weighing in at 12% alcohol, this seems light in body and sweet in style, with honeyed pineapple aromas and flavors of apple skin and lime. Finishes stridently, with a dusty texture.",Riesling
Germany,"Light and lean in style, maybe more classic than Johannishof's G bottling from the same vineyard, but also less enjoyable. Lime sherbet and quince form the crisp backbone, tinged with a hint of slightly confected strawberries.",Riesling
Germany,"While sometimes the Pauly-Bergweiler wines come across as too simply sweet, this one hits all the right notes, from an outrageously exotic bouquet of dried apricots, orange marmalade and faintly sweaty socks that add a kinky edge to the rich, layered texture in the mouth and virtually endless finish. Should age effortlessly for decades, but it's pretty spectacular now.",Riesling
Germany,"Bottling a TBA in this format makes great sense--it allows the tiny productions to be spread around and made more affordable. This is rich, sweet and superintense, with flavors of boiled down marmalade and honey that finish long, long, long. In this size bottle, opt for drinking it young versus extended cellaring.",Riesling
Germany,"One of the most remarkable things about the J.J. Prüm wines is their ability to marry richness with lightness, and that's well displayed in this auslese. The aromas are funky-stinky at first, yet with aeration those scents merge with tropical fruit to become an indescribably complex, seamless whole. Extremely long on the finish, with echoes of passion fruit lingering for minutes afterward. Drink now-2040.",Riesling
Germany,"Seems a bit cleaner on the nose than its counterpart from the Sonnenuhr, with slightly sweaty notes but also mouthwatering honey and pineapple aromas. This is full, rich and mouthcoating, offering up complex flavors of melon, honey and musky spices that linger elegantly on the finish. Should evolve at least through 2030.",Riesling
Germany,"A relative bargain in the stratospheric world of icewine, Loosen's 2007 boasts amazingly pure fruit essences resembling candied pineapple, peach, fruit cocktail and even some red-berry notes. It's plump in the mouth but not oversized, with a long, mouthwatering finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Shows some amazing aromatics similar to tea leaves to go alongside dried peaches and apricots. It's rich, sweet and unctuous in texture, coating the mouth with sugary goodness and yet finishing with mouthwatering acids as well. Drink now-2040.",Riesling
Germany,"This TBA shows an incredible likeness to Earl Grey tea, sweetened with honey and made subtly even more complex through the inclusion of dried stone fruits. It's rich and concentrated, not just sugary, but could use just a tiny bit more acidity to completely balance the finish. A decade or two of cellaring should see a more balanced wine in the end.",Riesling
Germany,"Deftly illustrates why auslese is the ripeness level favored by so many cognoscenti, as the wine still retains some flinty, slaty minerality to go along with the layers of ripe fruit. Honey and bergamot are joined by plump melon flavors and all of these notes come together ina crescendo on the succulent, mouthwatering finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Lean and racy, typical of the Saar even at these high ripeness levels, with hints of slate and mint or tea gracing pineapple fruit. The long, vibrant finish is crisp and mouthwatering, with the residual sugar dropping into the background. Drink now-2030+.",Riesling
Germany,"If you're seeking laser-like focus in your eiswein, this is the bottling for you. Although it starts off musky and feral, it's also ultracrisp and racy, with intense pineapple fruit surrounded by hints of wild meat and spice, then finishing with blazingly pure citrus.",Riesling
Germany,"Plump and succulent, layered with exotic fruit, this is one of Loosen's more explosive ausleses in recent memory. Passion fruit, mango, red berries and dried spices can all be found herein, ending in a long, palate-coating finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Concentrated apricot and peach aromas lead the way, followed by stone fruit and citrus on the palate. This is slightly drier and higher in alcohol (8.5%)than many eisweins, yet still lusciously sweet, with a suggestion of citrus pith on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Lean and focused, with powerful mineral notes reminscent of crushed stones balancing lime and honey. This is crisp and racy, nearly taut in its construction, yet elegantly wrought. Drink now-2020.",Riesling
Germany,"Full bodied and lush, with layers of honeyed fruit: peach, melon and pineapple. The minerality of the site is submerged under a wave of ripe fruit, so either enjoy it now for its fruit-forwardness, or hold 10 years to see how the slate looks when the fruit levels subside.",Riesling
Germany,"Honey and dried apricot notes accent the pineapple-infelcted fruit in this full-bodied, sweet auslese. Melon rounds out the midpalate, which offers plenty of flavor and succulence if not a ton of mineral complexity.",Riesling
Germany,"Eerily intriguing, like peering through a smoky lens of slate to see the fruit underneath. It's not overly intense or concentrated, but complex, with sweet flavors of peach and melon lingering on the mineral-infused finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Honeyed and viscous—this practically pours like syrup—this is a rich dessert wine, filled with flavors of dried apricots and ultraripe peaches. It's long and sugary on the finish, just lacks a bit of acid balance, and while the hints of caramelized nuts may add complexity, they could also be a hint of oxidation. Drink now, in small doses.",Riesling
Germany,"This may seem a bit sweet and heavy next to J.J. Prüm's bottling from the same vineyard, but it's still a darn good wine, with hints of dried apricots to accent pear, melon and spice flavors. It's thick and viscous, with a finish that lingers sweetly. Drink 2013-2020.",Riesling
Germany,"Smells of waxed citrus rinds, and although there's a hint of green apple to the flavors, that same citrusy note dominates. It's a light- to medium-bodied, relatively dry Riesling that could just use a touch more weight and power.",Riesling
Germany,A surprisingly attractive blend of green plum and apple flavors that manages to deftly balance sweetness and tartness to yield a balanced result. It's light body and sweetness make it a fine companion for your midweek order of Chinese takeout.,Riesling
Germany,"A reasonably dry, full-bodied style of Riesling, Fischer's 2005 shows bold aromas of lemon and quince, then rounds them out with a bit of apple on the palate. Crisp; a good partner for seafood.",Riesling
Germany,"A bit gold in color, this is an atypical Mosel kabinett, with a broad, verging on fat, mouthfeel and sweet flavors of honey and spice.",Riesling
Germany,"This delectable kabinett starts off with amazingly pure scents of crushed stone, lime and apple, then follows up with flavors of strawberries to go with more apples and limes. It's medium-bodied, slightly sweet but with the crispness to balance its sugars. Finishes pristine and fresh. Drink now-2016.",Riesling
Germany,"There's a slight hint of mushroominess to this wine's aromas, but otherwise it's rather clean, featuring apricot and candied orange aromas and flavors. Offers plenty of depth without being syrupy, ending with a pithy note to help balance the sweetness. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Intensely sweet, as you might expect, with scents of honey, dried apricots and clover. But there's also a hint of vinyl or plastic that mars the nose and the palate, so although this is sticky and long on the finish, it doesn't quite make top marks.",Riesling
Germany,"A strongly minerally wine, the 2005 Maria v. O. boasts perfumes of heating oil and smoke, while the flavors are of apple, pear and citrus, all wrapped in a petrolly shroud. Yet for all that, it also features sweetness balanced by lime-like acid and a clean, refreshing finish. Drink now–2015.",Riesling
Germany,"Prüm's 2007 Sonnenuhr auslese shows a typical youthful yeasty-leesy-sulfur funk, but also layers of ripe pear and citrus fruit lurking underneath. It's sweet but wonderfully balanced, plump and creamy in texture and long on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This richly concentrated wine offers plenty to like: dried apricot aromas, ripe melon and orange marmalade flavors and plenty of sugar. But there's a slightly mushroomy edge to the aromas and flavors, and this slightly fungal note persists through the finish, giving rise to some worry about how this wine will develop in bottle.",Riesling
Germany,"This auslese shows a wonderfully lithe and racy character that's different from this house's typical style. Crushed stone, apple, citrus and a trace of vanilla bean mark the nose, followed by flavors of pineapple inlaid with filigreed minerality.",Riesling
Germany,"This terrific dry Riesling features a complex interplay of mineral notes, honey, peach, citrus and dried spices. At 12.5% alcohol, it's pretty full-bodied and richly textured, with touches of lingering honey and citrus on the long, mineral-inflected finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Full-bodied and viscous without being overly sweet, this intense, powerful expression of Riesling features hints of apricot, bold green apple and lime notes and a touch of mushroom. The finish boasts heaps of spice and crisp acids for balance, trailing away ever so slowly.",Riesling
Germany,"This auslese shows tremendously lush fruit and a wonderful sense of purity to its aromas and flavors. Scents of pineapple, vanilla and crushed stone lead the way, followed by notes of tropical fruit wrapped around a core of slate. Drink now–2015.",Riesling
Germany,"This is a rich, succulent wine, more akin to an auslese than a true spätlese. Dried apricot and orange marmalade aromas and flavors surround a core of dried spices and crushed stone, finishing on a spicy, mineral note. Drink now–2025.",Riesling
Germany,"With its superripe aromas of honey, melon and spice, this is a mouthfilling, sweet wine. It's round, without any sharp edges, yet maintains German Riesling's unique minerality and cut on the long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now–2020.",Riesling
Germany,"This youthful auslese is still showing a lot of postfermentation estery characters: it's very perfumed and floral, with such tropical notes as banana and pineapple. The fruit is nearly overwhelming, and the wine is on the sweet side, so it's easy to overlook the underlying minerality, but it's there. Worth cellaring until at least 2015.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine's initial aromatics come across as rather subdued, but give them some time and they begin to unfurl into minerally billows of slate and citrus. This shows the crisp, tight structure of the Saar—it's a tightly coiled spring of green apple and citrus fruits around a core of minerality. Should age through 2015.",Riesling
Germany,"This is rather sweet—loaded with honeyed peaches and tropical fruit—but all of those ripe, rich flavors are brought into focus by the citrus- and mineral-edged finish. It's luscious now, but in 5–10 years it should be a complex, filigreed table wine.",Riesling
Germany,"A stunning expression of place, very mineral but with enough juicy stone fruit nuances to be immediately likeable. It's tight and focused, showing excellent balance and a long, perfumed finish. Drink now (think sushi) or stash away for five or more years for a more laid-back style.",Riesling
Germany,"Truly stunning, this white starts out with subtle talcum powder and gravel notes, then adds intense perfume and peaches in the mouth. There's a finely tuned balance and good length. Exceptional harmony and intensity suggest it will improve for 15 years or more.",Riesling
Germany,"Citrus and green apple flavors mark this rather light-bodied auslese. It's crisp, clean and fresh, with tart lemon-lime flavors on the finish and some modestly minerally undercurrents. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Light to medium in body, this is a clean, fresh auslese, not a big, sugary blockbuster. Pineapple and honey aromas lead the way, adding green apple, mint and citrus flavors as the wine crosses the palate. To some, it may seem a bit green and underripe despite the ample residual sugar, while to others it will a welcome respite from many of the overripe ausleses that are actually declassified BAs.",Riesling
Germany,"Ultraripe tropical fruits—even including hints of bananas—dominate this wine's heady aromas. Acids are soft, and alcohol fairly elevated—12.5%—for a wine of this prädikat. There's ample concentration, and the peach and melon flavors linger on the finish. Drink now–2016.",Riesling
Germany,"A pure expression of Mosel Riesling, with touches of flowershop greens, apple and lime. It's sweet but amply structured, with a core of crisp, juicy fruit and a long finish that echoes hints of honey and slate.",Riesling
Germany,"Right now the aromas are a bit tight—even steely—with just modest hints of apple and lime, but the fruit comes to the fore on the palate, exploding with baked apple and spice flavors, balanced by zippy acids. Best from 2011–2015.",Riesling
Germany,"Knyphausen's 2007 Erstes Gewächs wines from Erbach make a stunning couple. The Marcobrunn comes across as slightly cooler, not quite as rich or dense as the Steinmorgen, but possible more elegant. The apple, melon, citrus and mineral notes are delicately interwoven on the long, classy finish.",Riesling
Germany,"A good value among spätlesen, Mönchhof's 2005 Mosel Slate avoids the superripeness of the vintage, instead staying true to type. Hints of kerosene give a slate-like impression, layered over crisp lime and apple flavors. It's lithe and sinuous, ending crisp and racy.",Riesling
Germany,"Floral elements mark the nose, while the flavors of melon and vanilla also carry some slate-like minerality. It's plump and creamy without being overdone, finishing with a touch of spice.",Riesling
Germany,"Lighter in body and sweeter-tasting than the Abstberg Auslese #70, the regular auslese is almost delicate by comparison, featuring slatey, minerally notes to go alongside hints of honey, lime and orange. Finishes long and citrusy, with a dry mineral edge to help balance the sweetness.",Riesling
Germany,"Plump and rounded rather than racy. Some slightly dieselly aromas bring complexity to the mix of melon, spice and slate, while the mineral-laden finish lingers.",Riesling
Germany,"A succulent style that should have enormous appeal. Honey, pineapple and melon aromas and flavors show off Riesling's fruity side, but the wine's minerality keeps it from seeming overly simple.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine's elevated—for a fruchtig German Riesling—alcohol level (11.5%) and botrytis-influenced flavors of dried apricots and orange marmalade suggest early consumption, although some may want to see if it settles down in another five years. It's fat, oily and rich right now, and a bit warming on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,This wine is a shining example of the glorious minerality that singles out Mosel Riesling. The nose shows really appealing pear and gardenia scents overlaying wet stone notes. The mouthwatering acidity wakes up your palate and is in perfect balance with the substantial residual sugar. Drink now (with sushi) or hold five or more years for even more complexity.,Riesling
Germany,"At 9.5% alcohol and with plenty of residual sugar, this is rather broad, but it still boasts excellent intensity and complexity. Aromas of wet slate speak to the wine's origins, mixing easily with hints of clover leaf, apple, melon and lime. Ends citrusy, but also on a slightly chalky note.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine comes out of the bottle a little cranky, but give it some time in the glass and the initial stink gives way to notes of lime, apple and peach. It's plump in feel, with some dusty minerality and dried spices adding nuance to the sweet fruit.",Riesling
Germany,"This is close to dry in style, with its baked apple and spice flavors supported by stony, mineral notes and ample (12.5%) alcohol. It's fairly full-bodied for a German Riesling, finishing with hints of mineral oil that cling to the palate. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"From a top site, this is a big, full-bodied dry Riesling that features aromas of honey, mint and Golden Delicious apple. Those ripe apple notes continue on the palate, picking up citrus and herbal notes on the extended finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Ripe and richly fruity, with chunky flavors of oranges, honey and tropical fruit tinged with hints of mineral and orange pekoe tea. It's a lush mouthful of easy-to-enjoy fruit.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts off a little sluggish, offering up hints of roasted sweet corn on the nose, but those aromas soon give way to scents of pineapple and dried apples. It's soft in the mouth, verging on flabby, but has some charming flavors of apple and spiced pear that make it enjoyable as a chilled apéritif. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"An expressive, extroverted style that still communicates a sense of place. There's loads of dried fruit character here, with apple, nectarine, rose and graham flour flavors that build to a long-lasting finish. Light-bodied, with a spice aftertaste. Drink now or hold five-plus years.",Riesling
Germany,"Serious and earthy, like walking into a wall of minerality. The fruit takes a back seat here, but is lusciously peachy and fresh while the long finish is sparked by hints of exotic spices. Give this two to three years to show its best.",Riesling
Germany,"A creamy-textured, medium-bodied kabinett, Haart's 2007 features some leesy complexity upfront, then focused pineapple fruit on the midpalate. Finishes long, with citrus and mineral underpinnings that balance the wine's delicate sweetness. Now-2015.",Riesling
Germany,"Pleasantly plump and custardy in texture, this complex, mouthfilling wine offers a whirl of aromas and flavors, ranging from fresh asphalt to lime custard and green apple. By the finish, any objectionable notes have vanished, leaving a clean, lingering finish beaming with elegance. Consider decanting if drinking in the near future, or simply hold 3–5 years before sampling.",Riesling
Germany,"The ‘goldkap,' or ‘gold capsule,' in this wine's designation indicates a riper cuvée than the producer's ordinary spätlese. As expected, the fruit is exuberant and lush with hints of tinned apricots and peach jam. An underlying note of lemon zest enlivens the palate and carries over to the long, flowery finish. There's lots of sweetness here; consider serving on its own.",Riesling
Germany,"A mixture of mineral and spice accompanies the lemon and apricot fruit in this tangy, focused Riesling. There's plenty of intensity and an energizing balance of fresh acidity and lingering sweetness. Drink now or age four to five years.",Riesling
Germany,"With its delicate aromas of flowers, fresh greens and a hint of mint, you might expect this to be a light, delicate wine. But it's broad and rather sweet, marked by flavors of ripe apples and vanilla. It comes across a bit soft on the finish, but luscious.",Riesling
Germany,"The steep slopes of the Himmelreich provided some wonderful wines in 2005, and Raimund Prüm's offering has turned out well. It's a touch more muscular than some vintages, but finely focused, marrying aromas of green apple and crushed stone with flavors of honey, peach and pineapple and ending in a long, mouthwatering finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Aromatic, succulent and invigorating, this Riesling is firing on all cylinders. The palate is on the dry side with powerful flavors of honey, ginger and peach that fade to an enticing spice note.",Riesling
Germany,"At 13.5% alcohol, this is pretty ripe Riesling, broad in the mouth and almost oily in texture. Hints of honey and ripe pear mark the nose, but this wine is more about minerally extract than fruit. Turns spicy on the mouthcoating finish.",Riesling
Germany,"The Gunderloch wines are among the best from Rheinhessen, even their non-site-specific wines like the Diva spätlese. Aromas of bergamot, pear and fresh greens give way to ripe pineapple, citrus and herb flavors. It's fresh and zippy, offering a lot of refreshment value in an off-dry style.",Riesling
Germany,"A classic Mosel Kabinett that displays the concentration and pure, expressive fruit typical of the great 2008 vintage. There's loads of Asian spice, apple and gardenia on the nose, while a citrus top note come through on the palate. Finishes long, with a lingering mineral edge. Will improve over the next decade or more though it's drinking well now.",Riesling
Germany,"There's a lot going on here, with petroleum, musk, orange flower and clove scents on the nose while the palate is as light as a feather, with mouthwatering acidity and a zippy, cinnamon-infused finish. Drink now or hold several years for more complexity.",Riesling
Germany,"Presents an admirable blend of melon, lime, slate, mint and petrol, folding in apple notes on the palate. This is fairly sweet—close to unctuous—in style, while remaining fresh and fruit-driven from start to finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This plump, sweet auslese epitomizes the Pauly Bergweiler style. Honeydew and orange aromas and flavors are ripe and succulent—delicious in an easygoing way—but lack the complexity and extra sizzle to make the wine truly special.",Riesling
Germany,"A muscular, off-dry Riesling, marked by aromas of slate, melon and spice and flavors that include hints of anise and diesel oil. Although not marked as such, it seems halbtrocken in style, with just enough sugar to cushion the crisp acidity. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Imbued with an almost smoky mineral essence, this wine is moderately sweet, but balanced by crisp acids. Melon and pineapple flavors take over on the palate, but the minerality comes back to the fore on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Despite notes of honey and baked apple, this is an almost dry wine, boasting plenty of weight in the mouth. Orangey flavors pick up hints of peach and dried spices, turning stony on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Very impressive, with a mineral backdrop setting the stage for a powerful expression of apricot and pear fruit. The mouthwatering acidity masks a fair amount of residual sugar, resulting in a lingering finish that seems dry. Drink now or hold for several years for a more nuanced expression.",Riesling
Germany,"Give this wine some air before you serve it in order to appreciate the entire range of its dense aromatics, which flow from delicate tangerine, to peach and on into the mineral end of the spectrum. The palate is juicy, with an energizing tension between the nervy acidity and delicate sweetness. Finishes long, with a slate undertow. Try with cod in a miso sauce.",Riesling
Germany,"An interesting, characterful kabinett, with scents of smoke and scorched oil that mingle with lime and apple notes. On the palate, it delivers plenty of zippy citrus flavors, wrapped in a confounding veil of smoke and tar. Might prove better in time; give it 3–4 years of cellaring.",Riesling
Germany,"Willi Haag's 2007 spätlese from the Juffer boasts a high-class mélange of petrol and slate, flowers and citrus. It's medium in body, with surprisingly restrained fruit on the palate, finishing with just a touch of phenolic bitterness.",Riesling
Germany,"Released in the U.S. a bit later than most German wines, Raimund Prüm's 2006 Würzgarten kabinett remains primary and fresh, filling the room with aromas of green apple, lime and slate. It's medium in body (9% alcohol) and slightly creamy in texture, with an off-dry finish marked by hints of lime zest.",Riesling
Germany,"A plump, amply concentrated Riesling, with plenty of pineapple fruit to balance the hints of kerosene, slate and lime. Finishes crisp and clean, with a dry quality that invites another sip. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Strongly petrolly and slaty, with those powerful elements backed by apple and pineapple notes. It's plump for a kabinett, weighing in at 10.5% alcohol, but balanced and easy to drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Concentrated and balanced, with high residual sugar and lip-smacking acidity propping up elegant white flower notes. The long, clean, finish shows pretty green apple inflections. Drink now or cellar two to three years.",Riesling
Germany,"Kicks off with intensely petrol-like aromas and hints of vegetable oil rather than overt fruitiness, then develops flavors of honey, marmalade and spice on the palate. It's a rich, viscous wine that finishes very sweet—almost cloying—on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This starts off with some odd wet wool and fresh tar notes, but quickly rights itself, delivering a medium-bodied mouthful of crisp lime and melon fruit. If possible, give it a quick splash in a decanter before drinking.",Riesling
Germany,"Unusually lean and precise for a 2006, this shows some very floral, perfumed notes on the nose, and then delivers crisp green apple and underripe melon flavors.",Riesling
Germany,"A different aromatic profile here, with bread dough and wet grass scents dominating the nose. It's well structured, with good flowery intensity in the mouth and a weighty, medium-to-long finish. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine doesn't have the easy elegance of Nik Weis's best vintages, but it still packs in plenty of mineral-tinged apple and citrus flavor. Give it a year or two to come together, then drink it over the next five.",Riesling
Germany,"This medium-bodied kabinett features an appealing lushness to its texture—it's not a slim, racy wine but instead offers hints of honey and diesel oil balanced by ripe apples and citrus. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Soft at first, but the density of the pine, gardenia and spice flavors emerges as the wine opens up while the lingering finish shows excellent purity of fruit. Serve with sushi. Drink now or hold three to four years for more complexity.",Riesling
Germany,"This plump, medium-bodied kabinett seems destined for early maturity, as it relies on a touch of unreleased CO2 to give it liveliness. Drink it young while it's still fresh, and before the bold apple, pear and citrus flavors fade.",Riesling
Germany,"Lithe and streamlined, with spare fruit aboard a minerally frame. Kerosene and petrol notes dominate, ending with a burst of fresh lime-like flavors.",Riesling
Germany,"Bone dry but harmonious and well balanced, with ripe acidity and restrained pear, honey and petroleum notes in a medium-bodied frame. Its finish is long and minerally. Drinking well now but will show more finesse several years down the road.",Riesling
Germany,"Crisp and tightly wound, this Baden Pinot has lovely cherry pie and vanilla scents folding in to leather and mixed berry flavors on the palate. Long, slightly tart finish of saddle leather. Drink now to 2013.",Pinot Noir
Germany,"Intensely diesel-like on the nose, almost to the point of nuttiness, then full-bodied, broad and muscular on the palate, delivering flavors of oranges and wet stones. It's drier than many spätlesen, and while it may lack a bit of raciness and elgance, it makes up for it with sheer power.",Riesling
Germany,"An unoaked blend of 68% Chardonnay and 32% Pinot Blanc, with the peach and sweet-corn Chard flavors to pair with the orange and grapefruit notes of the Pinot Blanc. It's round and mouthfilling, finishing with hints of spice and citrus. Drink now.",Chardonnay-Pinot Blanc
Germany,"Slaty minerality frames bold pineapple and lime aromas and flavors in this medium-bodied, nearly dry Riesling. Fresh and minerally on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This is a lithe, sinewy wine, powerful yet lean, with coiled intensity to its crisp citrus and mineral flavors. It finishes long and tart, with the bracing acids suggestive of a long evolution. Hold 3–5 years and see if it blossoms.",Riesling
Germany,"Here's a good value in the world of Spätlese, with a clean, pretty nose of talcum powder and baby's breath. There's nice mineral intensity and an off-dry, mouth-puckering finish. This easy-to-like wine would be a good choice to serve as an apéritif to a crowd.",Riesling
Germany,"Very spicy, with candied orange peel and sour drop notes undercut by a lower honey-botrytis element. Appealing, if lacking the purity of the best from this hallowed vineyard. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"This seems a bit simple and confected for an Erstes Gewächs offering, with superripe, fruity aromas and flavors of apple, melon and lime. It's still a nice wine, medium-bodied and cleanly made, just lacking the minerality and complexity you'd hope for at this level.",Riesling
Germany,"If the first duty of an icewine is to be sweet, this satisfies that need. Its sugar is also reasonably balanced in this case by 10% alcohol and crisp acids. What's missing is the purity of fruit, as some slightly singed, earthy notes creep into its aromas and finish.",Silvaner
Germany,"This is a zippy little number, with scents of white cherries and citrus that float over a bed of petroleum and fresia. The crisp, off-dry finish winds down to a lingering grapefruit note. Drink now with cod in a miso sauce or stash away for a few years.",Riesling
Germany,"Like drinking a fruit cocktail. This exceptionally pretty white is succulent and balanced, with good depth and penetrating flower notes. The broad, medium-length finish is dominated by ripe cantaloupe and green apple notes. Drink now or hold a few years.",Riesling
Germany,"Generous, with a distinct pine character and tangy passion fruit flavors framing the medium-bodied palate. Exotic, medium finish of curry leaf and lemon curd. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"This is a decidedly nonfruity Riesling, marked instead by aromas of petrol and featuring flavors of crushed stone, canola oil and lime. It's relatively light in body and close to dry, finishing long and citrusy. Try it with a seafood salad or smoked trout.",Riesling
Germany,"On the dry side, this medium-bodied kabinett clocks in at 11% alcohol but seems balanced anyway, with peach and pear aromas and flavors given complexity through notes of smoke, clover blossom and mint. Crisp and refreshing on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine overdelivers for its pale garnet color. There's loads of sweet cherry fruit along with mocha and caramel character, all set in a bed of soft tannins. A long finish trails off to an extended earth note. Try with leg of lamb. Fully mature, drink up in the next year or two.",Pinot Noir
Germany,"A less fruity take, with mineral and kerosene dominating the nose and a wet slate thread running through the exquisitely crisp palate. Spring flowers and honey notes soften up the finish. Try with Thai noodles.",Riesling
Germany,"On the subtle side for a Mosel Riesling, with shy aromas of melon and peach and a stony character in the mouth. This one is likely to be more expressive after a few years in the cellar.",Riesling
Germany,"Elegant, though there's no shortage of density to these flavors. Membrillo, sour drops and apricot are the main themes, set against a mineral undertow. The palate is crisp and balanced though quite off-dry, winding down to a long, subtle finish of stone fruits. Great now, but will improve over the next few years.",Riesling
Germany,"On the big (12% alcohol) and dry side, with weighty flavors of minerals and spice undergirding ripe apple and pineapple notes. Not a traditional fruchtig kabinett, but one that should go well with rich fish dishes and roast chicken. Long on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This bursts out of the chute in a blaze of fruit—pineapple, pear, green apple, even a trace of banana. Honestly, it's a bit disconcerting. But give it some time in the glass and it really changes, going from simply fruity to complex and minerally. Rather full-bodied for a Mosel wine; it does show a touch of alcohol warmth on the finish. Imported by Magellan Wine Imports.",Riesling
Germany,"Raimund Prüm's Blue Slate is developing into a consistent performer, marrying hints of ripe fruit—peach or nectarine and melon—with crisp citrusy notes and an underlying minerality that gives it an almost dry finish. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Make no mistake—this is full-bodied, but it carries its 14.5% alcohol without any sign of warmth, just mouthcoating layers of flavor. Petrol and oily notes mark the nose and palate, but there's enough apple-y fruit and dried-spice notes to achieve complexity and balance. Dry essence of Riesling.",Riesling
Germany,"Textbook Saar kabinett, still wearing a some youthful leesy accents on the nose, but crisp and pure on the palate. Citrus and green apple aromas broaden ever so slightly into melon and pear flavors in the mouth, then return to crystal clear focus on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"An oddball of an eiswein. Bizarre earthy, brothy notes combine with honeyed sweetness to make for an ""interesting"" tasting experience.",White Blend
Germany,"This estate has been turning out better and better wines nearly every year, and this may be its best yet. A fabulous bouquet of honeyed slate, green apples and limes is followed by flavors that are sweet yet balanced, with great freshness and racy acidity. Finishes long and mouthwatering. Not only about power, there's also elegance to spare.",Riesling
Germany,"An exceptional example of what can be done with the humble Silvaner grape, this white is fresh and highly nuanced, with exotic galangal and Asian pear scents that lead to a crisp palate with Guanabana flavor. Dry, medium finish. Drink now to 2011.",Silvaner
Germany,"Savory in aroma, with popcorn and toast flavors punctuated by a spice thread. Noticeably off-dry, this subtle white winds up on a sweet peach note. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Still in need of cellaring or decanting to rid itself of some sulfury scents, but underneath that are some strident lime and green apple notes struggling to emerge. But have no doubt they will, blossoming into a wine that's crisp and light without lacking in intensity or flavor. Even now, it's long and racy on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"A slightly smoky, rock-dust component adds a layer of minerality to this wine's spiced pear and melon aromas. On the palate, it's off-dry, zesty and refreshing, with green apple and citrus flavors that end on a tangy note. One of the more lithe examples from the Rheinhessen.",Riesling
Germany,"A very good kabinett, one that effortlessly combines aromas of fresh greens, mixed citrus and green apples in a relatively lightweight package. Apple, citrus and melon flavors turn slightly honeyed on the finish, while remaining crisp enough to be rereshing.",Riesling
Germany,"Frankly sweet and almost flabby, with plenty of sugar, petrolly minerality and ripe pear flavors, but this wine lacks the buoyant citrusy zest needed for balance and length.",Riesling
Germany,This is a plump Pinot Gris that does show a bit of its 13.5% alcohol. Pleasant smoke and citrus aromas give way to grapefruit and spice flavors that fade a bit quickly on the finish.,Pinot Gris
Germany,"Seems a bit simple at first, mounding up fruity scents of apple, pineapple and pear. But give it some time to develop and it adds complex mineral and spice nuances. The wine is fairly rich and full-bodied, but the sweetness is balanced by crisp acids. Long in the finish and packed with dry mineral notes.",Riesling
Germany,"Zesty and fresh, with notes of green plums and grass leading to palate of lemon meringue and pineapple. Finishes sweet but well balanced, with a nice stone fruit accent. A good crowd-pleaser at a fair price.",Riesling
Germany,"Rich and succulent, with pineapple and jasmine top notes and intense stone fruit in the mouth. There's no shortage of sweetness here but it's well framed by a vibrant acid structure that carries the fruit through to the medium finish. Really well done.",Riesling
Germany,"Artfully shows the majesty of the Rheingau, combining a rich, full mouthfeel with enough acidity to keep it from seeming at all heavy. Slate, melon and lime flavors turn crisp and refreshing on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Light, clean and refreshing--all the qualities you might expect from a Mosel kabinett--and this wine has them. Pear, apple and melon aromas and flavors even bring hints of spice and minerality with them, elevating this wine above the rest of the pack.",Riesling
Germany,"Full-bodied for a Mosel wine, at 12% alcohol, but tasty, offering rather bland apple  or melon flavors but dusted with enough spice and mineral notes to add considerable complexity. Long, spice-driven finish. Imported by Magellan Wine Imports.",Riesling
Germany,"Seems sweet beyond the normal bounds of kabinett, but despite the high sugar levels, there's also a dry, dusty stoniness to the finish that provides a sense of balance. Crushed stone, green apple and lime scents lead the way, followed by riper apple, pear and honey flavors on the medium-weight palate. A candidate to match with spicy or slightly sweet Asian dishes.",Riesling
Germany,"Much lighter in weight than many Pinot Gris on the market, this is a pretty, fruit-driven rendering of the variety, blending tropical fruit with ripe apples and hints of pink grapefruit. It's crisp and clean on the finish.",Pinot Gris
Germany,"Plump and succulent, this is a deceptively easy wine. Ripe apple, pear and melon flavors make it seem simple, but underneath the flesh is a spine of bright acids and slatey minerality. Zesty lime and ripe orange notes give length to the crisp, lingering finish. Both this wine and the auslese are great.",Riesling
Germany,"A bit sulfury on the nose, but even through that veil it's possible to discern greatness. Citrus, melon and pear notes shine through, picking up mineral notes on the long finish, while the texture is plump but with elegant underlying structure. Drink 2010–2020.",Riesling
Germany,"Rock hounds will adore this wine, which shows off the dry minerality of the Abstberg. Crushed stone, spice and melon scents are fleshed out and embellished on the palate by honeyed notes of pineapple and dried fruit. Persistent citrus, honey and mineral notes linger elegantly on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Subtle for the type, with delicate quince, apricot and moss notes that lead to a lemony palate. Piquant acidity binds it all together in a taut frame. Off-dry. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Pretty, in a ballet dancer style, with an underlying strength that belies the apparent delicacy. Classic, peachy and delicious.",Riesling
Germany,"A very classic style, with peach and floral notes upfront set against a mineral backdrop. There's riveting acidity in the mouth and some slate character but it fades away a bit too quickly. Drink or hold a few years for a richer texture.",Riesling
Germany,"More powerfully built than most Saar wines, with a weighty 10% alcohol providing a solid core. Its dense, slate-driven aromas glide into a richly textured, creamy mouthfeel filled with smoke, petrol and peach-pear flavors that turn slightly oily on the finish. A bit different, but worth trying.",Riesling
Germany,"Slightly spicy and musky on the nose, but there's also plenty of apple and melon to balance out the ledger. Cinnamon and baked apple flavors finish a trifle soft, but there's good persistence and minerality as well. Made in a fuller style, but avoids clumsiness. Imported by Classical Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"This luscious, easy-to-drink Riesling starts off with perfumed, floral notes layered over ripe Winesaps, then moves smoothly into a midpalate laden with more apples and citrus. The long, succulent finish ends on a dry, minerally note, giving this rather sweet wine a fine sense of balance.",Riesling
Germany,"Shows a weaker side of the 2006 vintage, with an overly broad mouthfeel and a certain lack of precision, but still boasts ripe apple and melon flavors.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine pleases from start to finish, beginning with mouthwatering aromas of zesty limes and green apples and then adding plump, mouthfilling flavors of melon. Ends long, with pepper, spice and mineral notes.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine lacks the richness and texture of Knipser's Im Großen Garten bottling, but more than makes up for it with complex notes of spring flowers, bergamot, spice and mineral. Long and crisp on the finish, with potential to possibly improve up to 10 years.",Riesling
Germany,"Strikes a lovely balance between fruit and minerality, marrying ripe apple and orangey citrus notes with hints of petrol or diesel. Reasonably full-bodied, turning crisp and zesty on the spice-inflected finish. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Unusual, with pine, bread dough and fish seasoning scents underpinned by a note of lemon. There's mandarin orange in the delicate mouth, and a medium finish shot through with smoky notes. Drink now to 2012.",Riesling
Germany,"Quite off-dry but balanced, with pretty pear scents over a base of wet earth and honey. Medium, slightly funky finish. Ideal to partner with a Malaysian seafood dish. Drink now to 2012.",Riesling
Germany,"A very good halbtrocken, with fruit aromas and flavors reminiscent of tangerines and peaches layered over a minerally bedrock. Its medium weight and long, mouthwatering finish give it extra appeal.",Riesling
Germany,"Floral and citrusy on the nose, then picking up white peach, melon and pineapple flavors on the palate. Off-dry, but crisp and clean on the finish, where there's also a slight bitter-pith note.",Riesling
Germany,"Despite this wine's lightweight feel, it packs in plenty of authority and flavor, ranging from the suggestion of honeyed apples to hints of petrol and ripe peaches. A firm, minerally edge to the finish provides balance to the sweetness. Imported by Chapin Cellars.",Riesling
Germany,"Sweet and broad, with obvious spice, lychee and rose-petal aromatics but a disappointing lack of follow-through on the finish. It's good, but could use more vibrance and length.",Gewürztraminer
Germany,"It's stony and minerally on the nose, but also boasts vivid pear, melon and green-apple scents. The flavors verge on tropical, mixing ripe pear and melon notes with underpinnings of tangerine. It's all wrapped in a plump, succulent texture and features a long, lipsmacking finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This delicate wine is waif-like and virtually ephemeral on the nose, with subtle scents of mineral, fresh greens, citrus and apple. In the mouth, it shows similar finesse, striking a fine balance between sweetness and tart green-apple and lime flavors. Finishes long, accented by bright citrus notes.",Riesling
Germany,"A fairly big, broad-shouldered wine that displays ripe baked apple and spice scents, but also intense minerality. The slightly oily texture comes off like creamy molten rock, finishing long and mostly dry, with lingering slatey notes.",Riesling
Germany,"A rich, unctuous style of auslese, with broad, sweet flavors of poached apple and pear, accented by hints of dried apricots and spice. This is a bit on the sticky side but may come into better balance over time.",Riesling
Germany,"Reasonably priced for a Riesling of this quality, this off-dry wine is filled with spiced baked apple flavors. Touches of petrol and stone dust impart a sense of minerality, while the finish is long and mouthwatering.",Riesling
Germany,"Like all of the Weil wines, even this entry-level effort places an emphasis on ripeness. Hints of smoke and diesel add complexity to the nose, while on the palate it's broad and slightly off-dry, with sun-drenched flavors of nectarine and melon that coat the mouth on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Spice and baked fruit are the dominant scents here while an intense flavor of mandarin orange characterizes the palate. It's just off-dry and quite crisp, a good choice for a Thai fish preparation. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"There's sweet, ripe fruit here meshed with black earth notes but also a back note of rhubarb and green vegetables. Crisp, medium finish. A few years in the cellar will help integrate a slightly disjointed vanilla note.",Spätburgunder
Germany,"This medium-bodied halbtrocken features open aromas of blended apples, pears and melons, infused with just enough spicy complexity. Finishes off-dry, finely representative of its classification. Imported by Chatham Imports.",Riesling
Germany,"Full-bodied and rich, even a little oily in texture, this is a big mouthful of Riesling, yet it's spicy and floral, making for an elegant presentation. Drink it now to make the most of its intricate bouquet.",Riesling
Germany,"A soft, fruity wine, Knyphausen's entry-level Riesling has hints of flowers on the nose, then delivers weighty pear and melon flavors. Off-dry. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Broad and mouthfilling, this sweet kabinett starts with muted honey and tangerine aromas, then blossoms on the palate into ripe peach flavors. Verges on tropical before being reined in on the finish by bright lime notes.",Riesling
Germany,"The fruit seems rather restrained in this medium-bodied Riesling. Instead, the emphasis is on slatey, minerally scents, backed by soft apple and citrus flavors. Imported by Chapin Cellars.",Riesling
Germany,"Light, crisp and fresh, with bright citrus notes leading the way. Aromas of fresh lime and grated orange peel mark the nose, while the palate adds green apples and a touch of mint. Refreshing on its own, or with modestly spicy cuisine.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts off a bit sulfury, but it's manageable, lifting in a few minutes to reveal bright citrus and green apple notes. The wine is light and dry, with modest pear and citrus fruit flavors, but its focus is on minerality, which persists through the long finish. Imported by Classical Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"Although not an officially defined label term, feinherb seems to be gaining in usage to describe a wine that's drier than the traditional fruchtig style, but not as severe as a halbtrocken or trocken. This one is light and fresh, with minerally, spicy notes layered over green apple and citrus. Finishes crisp and nearly dry.",Riesling
Germany,"Scents of fresh greens--perhaps fern fronds--quickly give way to flavors of superripe apples and honey. Yet the wine retains a light, feathery mouthfeel, turning drier on the finish, with a slight sense of sourness at the end.",Riesling
Germany,"Seems a bit too big and bulky in the mouth, with a touch of warmth on the finish, but has plenty of pluses as well, showing more minerality and complexity than many wines in this price range. Hints of honey, petrol and smoke intertwine with melon and pineapple fruit. Imported by Magellan Wine Imports.",Riesling
Germany,"A bit thin in texture, with wan apple and citrus flavors.",Pinot Gris
Germany,"Although the aromas of this wine are largely neutral, showing just hints of apple and citrus, the flavors come alive on the palate, offering up ripe apple, lime, nectarine and spice notes. It's slightly oily in texture, finishing softly tart, accented by dried spices.",Riesling
Germany,"Lime, honey and slate aromas mingle easily on the nose of this medium-bodied Riesling, while the flavors show hints of melon rind and plenty of peppery spice. Finshes crisp, with zesty acids balancing a touch of sweetness. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Lots of pure peach on the nose, with notes of lemon and ginger. Open-knit and sweet on the palate, with hints of custard, mango and baked pineapple. Spritzy and zesty, yet sweet. An interesting wine that isn't commonplace. Imported by Mountain Peoples Wine.",White Blend
Germany,"One of the better M-T's to come our way, this offering from Castell is virtually dry, with exotic orange-blossom and spice notes that give it plenty of character. It's plump and fleshy, yet still fresh on the finish.",Müller-Thurgau
Germany,"Floral and apple-y on the nose, providing textbook Riesling aromas. Crisp green apple and lime flavors continue the theme, accented on the finish by racy acids. With its modest weight on the palate, this is a dry, refreshing summer drink. Imported by Magellan Wine Imports.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts off with an overpowering scent of burnt matchstick, but with determined swirling, some lemon curd and green apple aromas emerge. It's light to medium in body and rounded rather than crisp, with citrus and apple flavors that turn minerally on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Rather full and round in the mouth—the combined effect of 12.5% alcohol and a touch (0.6%) of residual sugar—this nevertheless does taste pretty dry. It's a minerally version, with smoky minerality and powdered—almost liquified—stone notes fleshed out by hints of tangerine and peach. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"Off-dry, as expected from a halbtrocken, marrying stony, underripe peach notes with hints of oil and honey. The combination of sugar and tartness gives it a tangy finish.",Riesling
Germany,"On the full-bodied side, with pear, melon and white peach aromas and flavors that finish in a flurry of spice and mineral. Has the weight to stand up to roast chicken with Indian seasonings, just don't go too spicy, as this dry wine lacks the sugar to combat the heat. Imported by Magellan Wine Imports.",Riesling
Germany,"Rather big and full-bodied (13% alcohol), but also full-flavored, combining honeyed orange peel with ripe melon notes and a dry-ish, spicy finish. Imported by Classical Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"A good buy in dry Riesling, this light to medium-bodied wine boasts nicely balanced flavors of citrus, green apple and herbs and a zesty, lemony finish that will perk up jaded palates this summer. Imported by Chapin Cellars.",Riesling
Germany,"My colleagues tell me I'm being too harsh on this wine, but I just don't get it. It's good, but rather austere and unyielding, despite having ripe citrus flavors. There's also a grassy, herbal note that detracts from the purity of the Riesling fruit. Imported by Classical Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"Smells ripe and rich, with scents of baked apples and pineapples and a trace of honey, and the wine is plump in the mouth, full of citrus and melon flavors. Yet for some reason this sample lacked zip and verve to balance the fruit, ending somewhat short.",Riesling
Germany,"This halbtrocken is light and crisp, featuring an almost dry finish that shows just a bit of honey at the end. Green apple, lime and pineapple aromas and flavors are fresh and inviting, just lack a little complexity.",Riesling
Germany,"Serve this crisp, citrusy dry Riesling as an apéritif or with simple seafood dishes, where its simple lemon-lime and green-apple flavors will refresh the palate. Imported by Reh Kendermann GmbH Weinkellerei.",Riesling
Germany,"This is a crisp, tongue-tingling Riesling. It starts with scents of oiled apples, but quickly turns lemony, racing across the palate with zesty acids.",Riesling
Germany,"Light and fresh, this is a friendly fruitball of a Riesling. Riper peach and melon notes accent green apples and limes, then end on a crisp, refreshing note. A solid choice for the picnic hamper. Imported by Palm Bay Imports.",Riesling
Germany,"A bit of a letdown after the past couple of vintages, this wine boasts slightly spicy and floral aromatics, but doesn't quite follow through on the palate, where there's ample weight but less flavor. Pleasant, but not special this year.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts off promising, with an elegant bouquet that evokes just-ripe cherries and delicate herbal notes. Turns chocolaty on the palate, offering a smooth, polished mouthfeel and tangy acids on the finish.",Spätburgunder
Germany,"Comes out of the chute with hints of smoke and minerals layered over ripe melon and citrus. Round and mouthfilling in its sweetness, yet with enough acidity to give it some length and freshness on the finish. Imported by The Marchetti Co.",Riesling
Germany,"This light-bodied Riesling is true to its roots in the Mosel, offering slatey complexity that's surprising for the price, balanced by citrus and pineapple flavors. Imported by Schmitt-Sohne Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Medium-bodied, somewhat full, in fact, with a fair amount of sweetness that comes across as ripe melon and apple flavors, partly balanced by citrus on the finish. Imported by Schmitt-Sohne Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Although this wine boasts a viscous, slightly oily texture, the aromas and flavors are somewhat stony and unyielding. Hints of apple, peach and spice finish with a hard edge.",Riesling
Germany,"Reasonably plump in the mouth and maybe even showing a touch of sweetness, this is a clean, well-crafted Riesling with straightforward green apple and citrus flavors. A squirt of lime gives the finish a tangy quality. Drink now.",Riesling
Germany,"In what could prove to be a breakout vintage for Loewen, the Leiwener Klostergarten Kabinett is a star. Heavily mineral on the nose, with some characteristic leesy notes, it then bursts on the palate with concentrated flavors of apple, pear and lime, all underscored by cool minerality. Finishes long and citrusy. Imported by Michael Skurnik Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"Racy and crisp, this wine showcases the balance that is a hallmark of the best '04s. Green apple and lime aromas segue easily into similar flavors, graced with touches of spring flowers and leafy greens, while the vibrant apple notes linger elegantly on the finish. Imported by Michael Skurnik Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"Flagrantly floral on the nose, with lilac scents layered over pineapple fruit. Despite fresh apple and pear flavors over a minerally foundation, this wine comes across as a bit heavy, only partially balanced by some tangy acids on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"As a simple summer quaffer, this wine fits the bill. It's off-dry and slightly plump in the mouth, with citrusy flavors that range from grapefruit through orange to tangerine. Short on the finish.",Pinot Gris
Germany,"Plump and sweet, this simple summer quaff features ripe pear and pineapple flavors offset by hints of lime. Zesty acids on the finish provide more refreshment value than other wines in this class.",Riesling
Germany,"Broad and sweet on the palate, with peppery aromas and simple melon and citrus flavors. Short, clean finish.",Müller-Thurgau
Germany,"Rather full-bodied, this inexpensive Pinot Gris is spiked with scents of flowershop greens. Herbal notes accent the off-dry, citrusy fruit. Cleanly made, but short on the finish.",Pinot Gris
Germany,"Lacks expressiveness on the nose, but offers a broad, sweetish swathe of melon and citrus flavor. Garden-party material.",Müller-Thurgau
Germany,"This colorfully packaged wine is a little on the sweet side, which creates a broad, mouthfilling texture while at the same time it lacks real depth or complexity. Instead, you get soft pear and melon flavors that finish short.",Riesling
Germany,"Light and fresh, marked by flavors of pie cherries, cranberries and fresh herbs or grasses. Crisp and tart on the finish.",Pinot Noir
Germany,"A medium-bodied dry Riesling, this offers rather simple, fruity flavors of apple and pineapple. Although it lacks a great deal of complexity, it's well-balanced and harmonious; easy to drink.",Riesling
Germany,"You don't find too many German Sauvignons, and maybe this wine tells us why. It's spritzy and artificially sweet, almost like lemon-lime soda pop. Could be better in the summer if served nicely chilled. Imported by Mountain Peoples Wine.",Sauvignon Blanc
Germany,"Smells like Riesling, with scents of green apples, citrus and some vaguely floral notes, but turns a bit fat and dull on the palate. Soft and short on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Cleanly made, this plump, sweet wine offers simple pear flavors at an bargain price.",Riesling
Germany,"Aside from vaguely mineral aromas, this wine is devoid of interest. Slightly pickle-y notes on the palate combine with subdued melon and apple flavors.",Riesling
Germany,"Selected from the Erdener Treppchen vineyard, this racy, elegant spätlese is sweet, yet artfully balanced by lime-like acids and stony, mineral tones. Piercing notes of Granny Smith apples, limes and pineapple reprise on the crisp, long finish. Imported by Cellars International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts off a bit tarry and rubbery—downright stinky, in fact. Just be patient, or decant vigorously, and you'll be amply rewarded by pineapple fruit so pure it seems almost crystalline in both flavor and structure. It's fleshy, yet sharply delineated and focused, ending in a laserbeam of vibrant citrus. Imported by Michael Skurnik Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"This is a big, mouthfilling, dry Riesling, a bit austere on the nose, but ample in the mouth, where crunchy rocks dominate. Hints of underripe peach and crisp apple peek through, but this wine is all about the minerals and stony dryness. Imported by Cellars International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"True to the style at Pauly-Bergweiler, this is a sweet, rich wine, with superripe apple, pear and even tropical fruit notes. There's also a bit of diesel and slate and good acidity for balance. Finishes long and mouthwatering. Imported by Winesellers Ltd.",Riesling
Germany,"Easily mixes melon and slate scents on the nose, then blends in pear flavors on the palate. Just off-dry (“trocken” doesn't necessarily mean bone- dry), with weight and body provided by relatively high (12.5%) alcohol. Turns pleasantly spicy on the finish. Imported by Magellan Wine Imports.",Riesling
Germany,"Star winemaker Ernie Loosen is now consulting for Graff, and the wines have taken a step up in quality. Leesy and a bit sulfury on the nose, but underneath are some wonderfully pure flavors of melon and mineral, finishing with a dusting of dried spices and powdered mineral over poached apple. Could be racier, but the broad, mouthfilling flavors are satisfying in a different way.",Riesling
Germany,"Named for its source, the Rüdesheimer Drachenstein, Leitz's entry-level wine is a perennial favorite. Unfortunately, the price has crept up over the past few vintages to the point that it is no longer the screaming bargain it once was, but it is still a lovely wine, with citrusy, bergamot flavors and riper hints of apple. Long, clean and refreshing on the finish. Imported by Michael Skurnik Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"A broad, mouthfilling kabinett that's filled with green apple and plum fruit, with some riper peach notes sprinkled in as well. Plump and sweet, maybe a bit soft for some palates, but clean and very well made. Imported by Cellars International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Smoky and leesy on the nose, this big, broad-shouldered trocken boasts bold flavors of apple and clove, yet finishes dry, stony and long. Could work nicely with not-too-sweet, not-too-hot Asian dishes. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Despite the “dry” label, this wine boasts sweet-tasting flavors that are fruity and simple, favoring apple and pineapple, then turning tart and citrusy on the finish. Cleanly made.",Riesling
Germany,"Plump, yet buttressed by firm acidity, Wallhausen's kabinett features strong minerality this year. My original notes on its aromas read: powdered mineral, apple, pear, mineral. Tastes like liquid rocks, with hints of green herbs. Finishes with a grapefruity flourish. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Very primary and fruity, with excellent purity of flavor. Pineapple, pear and apple scents start it off, then add strawberry nuances on the palate. It's graceful yet powerful; lithe like a feline huntress. Finishes long, with hints of mineral and spice. Imported by Michael Skurnik Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"Lovely, delicate aromas of fern fronds, green apples and limes set the stage for crisp flavors of pineapple and lime. Yet despite the high acidity, the mouthfeel is somewhat plump. Finishes long, tart and mouthwatering. Imported by Cellars International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Big and sweet; broad and mouthfilling. It has decent complexity (pear, peach, dried spices and fuel oil) but lacks delicacy and raciness. If you like your Rieslings on the heavy side, you'll rate this even higher. Imported by Winesellers Ltd.",Riesling
Germany,"Words hardly do this wine justice. It's unctuous almost beyond the point of being wine—offering a mèlange of dried fruits and honey that ooze over every taste bud, filling the pores of your mouth and then releasing sugar and flavor for minutes afterward. And the aromas aren't too shabby either, giving up intense scents of dried apricots and orange marmalade, tinged with tea-like notes that add a sense of lightness and complexity.",Riesling
Germany,"Reasonably priced for an eiswein, this immensely thick, oily offering coats the palate with intense sweetness, but also succulent flavors of flower syrup, ultraripe pears and apricots. Candied orange notes linger forever on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine's intense aromas of honey, oranges and tea seem almost a little roasted or caramelized, but on the palate the flavors are brilliantly defined and focused by vibrant acidity that brighten the bold citrus and honey notes. A  rich and viscous mouthfeel, yet miraculously crisp at the same time; the acids keep the finish echoing in your mouth for a long, long time.",Riesling
Germany,"What balance! This wine's considerable sweetness is admirably buffered by ample acidity, while low alcohol adds to the impression of lightness and ease. This structural balance is complemented by the way slaty-minerally aromas play off bright tangerine and peach flavors, ending seamlessly, crisp and long. Delicious now, but should easily age 20 years.",Riesling
Germany,"Insanely priced, but if you love ultrasticky dessert wines, this is one you'll want to try at least once. Shows the merest hint of volatility on the nose, but also striking floral and mineral components. Broad and viscous on the palate, with intensely honeyed flavors of dried apricots and orange marmalade that last a long, long time. Should age virtually forever.",Riesling
Germany,"On the full-bodied side, but the combined weight of sugar and alcohol is ably balanced by bountiful acids. Floral notes lead off the nose, followed by hints of pineapple and spice, then dried apricots and candied fruit kick in on the palate. Clean on the finish, not overly sweet or cloying.",Riesling
Germany,"Is this a breakout year for Nik Weis? Never before have I found his range of wines so compelling, and this spätlese is just one example. Yes, it's still marked by heavy leesy notes on the nose, but the fruit is plump and succulent on the palate, mixing melon and apple notes with a heavy dose of spice and mineral.",Riesling
Germany,"It's rare to see older vintages of German wines released straight from the estate cellars, so if you haven't had the chance to sample older German dessert wines, this may be worth a try. It's pretty darn good, too, with lovely clover blossom and honey scents leading into dried apricot and juicy pineapple flavors. Don't expect a thick, syrupy wine—this has a light touch and impeccable balance that might best be paired with foie gras, fresh fruit or mild cheeses rather than full-blown dessert. Reasonably priced, considering the prädikat and age.",Riesling
Germany,"Like virtually all St. Urbans-Hof wines, this one starts off a bit sulfury, but the quality of the wine underneath is readily apparent, from its scents of slate and apple to flavors of white peach and melon. It's generous in fruit, yet restrained in texture, featuring an almost austere minerality that balances the wine's residual sugar. Cool and stony on the finish, this wine has a long future ahead of it.",Riesling
Germany,"This medium-bodied spätlese has a firm spine of acidity to help keep its shape through potentially decades of aging. Apple, clove and melon fruit is buttressed by layers of minerals and spice and a long, crisp finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Rich and unctuous, but not a simple fruit-bomb of concentrated fruit, there's also great minerality and some kerosene. Apple, peach kernel and baking spice flavors end on a honeyed note.",Riesling
Germany,"A step up from the 2003 offerings from this estate, with clean, vibrant aromas of vanilla, melons and white peaches. Flavors are similar, with just enough citrus to balance the sweetness. It's plump, yet spry and light on its feet—an attractive combination.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts with beautifully defined aromas of green apple and lime, then adds tangerine flavors to the mix on the palate. It's not heavy, but it's not light, either, deftly balancing acid, alcohol and sugar. Long and minerally on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Kerner is a variety not often seen in the U.S., although it is among the top five most planted white grapes in Germany. It's a cross between Trollinger (a red grape) and Riesling, making for—in this case—a pretty, aromatic white with hints of muskmelon, tropical fruit, maybe even some red berries, all on a light frame. Long and refreshing on the finish.",Kerner
Germany,"Shows the bright, vibrant character of the vintage, marrying zesty lime notes with hints of minerals, sweet pineapple and green apple. Fresh and clean, with a mouthwatering finish that leaves you wanting another sip.",Riesling
Germany,"Bargain-priced eiswein doesn't grow on trees (it's picked from frozen vines), but this offering is excellent. Honey and baked apple scents lead into flavors of poached or baked apple and pears, touched with a hint of bergamot. Clean and focused on the finish, so it doesn't end up sticky and cloying.",Riesling
Germany,"A bit fuller and drier than you might expect from a Mosel Riesling, but there's no questioning this wine's excellent balance. Honey and cinnamon notes accent pear and melon fruit, while hints of petrol lurk in the background. It's almost dry on the long finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This winery seems to be moving from strength to strength, turning out thickly concentrated yet precise wines in 2003 and now offering this lithe, succulent 2004 auslese. Lime and green apple aromas even smell refreshing, while the sweet apple and pineapple flavors are balanced by ample, yet soft, acids. A mouthwatering finish just adds to the package.",Riesling
Germany,"Plump in the mouth but backed by strong acidity, this spätlese offers impressive value. Pineapple, green apple and citrus flavors are joined by a streak of dusty minerals that give this a drier-than-expected finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Boasts classic Mosel Riesling aromas and flavors—lime, pineapple, green apple, maybe a touch of honey—all at an eminently reasonable price. Though richer and creamier than you might expect, the weight is balanced by crisp acidity on the long finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Smoky and intense, with peach, melon and floral aromas that burst from the glass. In line with the Charta designation, it's made in a trocken, or dry, style, yet doesn't lack for fruit or flesh. It's fairly rich and full (12% alcohol), yet boasts racy acidity for near-perfect balance.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts off really promising, with scents of honey, spiced pears, slaty-minerally  notes and a touch of diesel. Flavors follow suit, cleaned up on the finish by mild citrusy notes. The only problem area for this wine is its mouthfeel, which lacks the lightness and grace to score higher, instead coming across as slightly round and bulky.",Riesling
Germany,"Johannes Leitz is rightfully proud of his 2002s. This is his entry-level wine, and it's gorgeous, with a touch of sweetness and slightly rounder acidity than last year's version (which, incidentally, is still going strong). It boasts copious apple, red berry and citrus flavors and a forceful, lingering finish. Sinfully easy to drink.",Riesling
Germany,"This is a buxom, charming fleshpot of a wine, round and mouthfilling—even a bit fat—but amiable and pleasing. Apple, pear and honey notes are accented by spice, minerals and citrus, with a lusciously peachy finish.",Riesling
Germany,This rather obscure grape variety has produced a medium-bodied TBA complete with scents of dried apricots and a dieselly component. Candied pineapple and citron-like flavors end with hints of peppery spice and sourness.,Huxelrebe
Germany,"Medium- to full-bodied, this sweet spätlese features lively aromas of green apple layered over scents of diesel oil. Pineapple flavors add citrusy brightness to the midpalate, finishing with milder notes of tangerine.",Riesling
Germany,"Reasonably priced for an auslese, this medium-weight Riesling offers perfumes of clover blossom and poached apples and pears. On the palate, there's a pronounced quince or citrus edge that provides balance, but also a slight hint of bitterness.",Riesling
Germany,"An elegant Chardonnay-based sekt, with mineral notes accented by a fine bead and appe, citrus and spice components in pleasant balance. Creamy and smooth in the mouth, with a lingering finish.",Chardonnay
Germany,"The juice here comes from old vines from the steepest portion of the Altenberg slope. Still quite young, showing a hint of diesel with some botrytis as well. Clean, slatey, unbelievably intense bouquet with dense floral, citrus rind, and mineral scents. The fruit is ripe, full, perfectly harmonious and long. It finishes with just a kiss of honey. Delicious right now, but built for the long haul. Cellar Selection.",Riesling
Germany,"This is a lovely wine, impeccably balanced between sweet and crisp, with concentrated fruit that retains its elegance. Honeysuckle, apricot, jasmine tea and every kind of citrus fruit you can conjure up. Young, hard and fruity, it barely shows the depth and layers of flavor that will develop. It will be hard to keep your hands off it.",Riesling
Germany,"This 14-acre monopole is Dr. B-W's top property. The wine has big fruit, but is still tight, with interlaced layers of pineapple, lime and mineral with a waxy note. Extremely concentrated and rich, with a slightly viscous mouthfeel, it's a baby that's impressive for its vigor, density and superbly balanced weight. Talk about structure—after two days, it showed even more vigor, power and depth than when it was first tasted. Cellar Selection.",Riesling
Germany,"Slate, smoke and tart and tropical fruit scents mix in the beguiling nose. This concentrated wine is still young and tight, but it already shows rich, full fruit flavors that broaden into a full, generous finish as it breathes. The brisk acidity and mineral-slate elements add depth and complexity. Can use a few years to show all its best stuff.",Riesling
Germany,"Simply gorgeous aromas of honey, apricots and tangerines are echoed on the palate, where the wine is full, rich and sweet without seeming overly heavy. The moderate levels of acidity provide adequate balance now, but may prove too low for extended aging; that's okay, because it's so good now. Probably best over the next 5–10 years.",Riesling
Germany,"Similar in aromatics and flavor to Werner's slightly less weighty BA, the TBA features musky scents reminiscent of tropical flowers as well as tremendous weight and texture. Molasses and caramel notes reverberate on the long finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Yes, this is the current release. The “R” series of Dr. B-W has a minimum of 5 years in bottle; in this case it's 10. The concentrated and intense superripe aromas and flavors are not too sweet, show no botrytis and are still quite lively at this age. Tropical fruit, orange and pure grape flavors mingle sensuously with spice and vanilla. They play out on a long, ripe, almost unctuous finish that blends in hints of diesel. A perfect foil for foie gras.",Riesling
Germany,"Explosive ripe, luscious fruit bursts from the glass in the pungent nose and expands full throttle on the palate. The flavors, complex and layered, include honeysuckle, lime, mineral and some lovely, tropical fruit—especially mango and pineapple. Long and seamless. Editors' Choice.",Riesling
Germany,"A sinuous wine with lots of lime and mineral elements beautifully entwined. The bouquet is attractive but taut with lime and mineral notes. In the mouth the wine really opens up, with peach, tangerine, lime and green-apple fruit with a faintly spritzy feel. The sweet fruit is supported by good acidity and balanced nicely by the strong, stony mineral element. The fruit, minerals and good grip, must come from the amazingly steep rocky vineyard source. Just 400 cases made. Editors' Choice.",Riesling
Germany,"Delicious and bold, the bouquet of this Auslese is a melange of orange blossom, honey, cinnamon—even banana aromas. Rich, but not cloyingly sweet, orange, honey and mango flavors show on the palate, and the velvety smooth texture wears them well. Turns a bit drier and towards mild citrus flavors on the finish. Best now through 2004.",Riesling
Germany,"The soft, spicy scents of the bouquet mix grapes, flowers, talcum powder and a faint petrol note to create an almost Gewürz-like symphony. It's lovely and impressively complex, as layers of grape flavor, flowers, minerals and citrus rind gain power in the mouth. The mineral elements come up on the tangy finish. Exotic and smooth, it is immediately appealing but also built to age for 6–8 years.",Riesling
Germany,"This is a big, slatey, mouthfilling Saar wine, bone dry, with depth and dimension, the kind of wine one can savor with or without food. The forward, effusive nose suggests flowers, fruit and stone, and the wine has a tight, confident focus in the mid-palate. Still hard and young in the finish; this is a cellar candidate at a good price.",Riesling
Germany,"Vanilla and crème brûlée aromas add complexity to intensely sweet orange-marmalade and apricot aromas and flavors. Focused, with good balancing acidity that leaves a clean citrusy finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Solid and well-rounded, this very tasty wine has lively spice and apple aromas. The juice has nice texture on the tongue, well defined apple and peach flavors, and again the spice, which may be characteristic of the Nonnenberg vineyard. The long, even finish shows the tangy spice elements well. Will drink well for the next five years, maybe more.",Riesling
Germany,"This old-vine parcel of Erdener Prälat has yielded an impressively minerally and spicy spätlese, buffered by ripe apples and pears. A slightly oily texture suggests ample concentration, but the wine doesn't fully flesh out in the midpalate, leaving a slight hollowness that kept me from being more enthusiastic.",Riesling
Germany,"Intensely petrolly on the nose, with a rather full mouthfeel and dense, minerally flavors. This is stolid and sullen right now, but undeniably intense. Hints of spice on the finish bode well for the future, so stow it away for 3–4 years before trying it with something substantial, like roast pork.",Riesling
Germany,"A bit of a disappointment after the stellar 2004 auslese, Vollrads's BA is thick and syrupy, but also has a slightly acetic edge to its aromas and flavors. Dried fruit and honey marry with melon notes that tail off a bit on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"A full bouquet with tropical fruit, floral notes and vanilla accents opens this very friendly and lively Riesling. This offers a lot—bright and pretty orange and lime flavors and a brisk, zingy mouthfeel from the citrusy fruit and the underlying acidity. The full finish features spicy tarragon notes on top of the fruit. More Americans should try with wines like this. Best Buy.",Riesling
Germany,"Dr. Loosen's Kabinett wines sometimes approach the Spätlese level of concentration and flavor; this Spätlese could be someone's Auslese. It's decadently ripe, a rich mouthful of peaches, apricots, orange and pineapple, almost viscous and floral-honey sweet. Which is not to say it lacks acidity, structure or balance. Wonderful, spicy-sweet cinnamon and nutmeg accents offset the fruit, there's a somewhat grainy palate texture, like ultraripe pears. Finishes long.",Riesling
Germany,"A floral and lightly citric nose introduces this dry, crisply elegant Riesling. The wine cleanses the palate with compact and detailed  flavors and leaves you reaching quickly for the next sip. This brand new wine for Breuer is designed especially for early consumption and wine-by-the-glass programs, and fulfills its mission beautifully. Best Buy.",Riesling
Germany,"Smells crisp and steely, full of limes and green apples, then turns softer on the palate where ripe pears and MacIntosh apples take over. It's delicately off-dry, balanced by adequate acidity that extends through the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Montosa is a proprietary wine from Breuer's vineyards. Attractively aromatic it displays ripe pear, kiwi and tangerine scents wiht a hint of petrol. On the palate it's like a crisp green apple, offset by stony accents and showing bright acidity. The crisp finish shows good length.",Riesling
Germany,"This is a proprietary blend of grapes that may include Lemberger, Dornfelder, Cabernet, Merlot and Sangiovese. It surprises, with handsome and ripe loganberry and black cherry fruit offset by dark, tarry, smoky barrel flavors with a chocolatey undercurrent. There's brisk acidity, but the fruit is ripe, clean and interesting, and proves that in the right hands red grapes can work in Germany's warmer Pfalz region.",Red Blend
Germany,"A lovely bouquet of ripe peach, apricot and lemon notes. Fairly round peach, tart apple and earth flavors play on the palate and linger through the clean finish with its green apple and crisp mineral elements. From a well-regarded vineyard on a heart-stopping vertical slope, known for its elegant wines, everything here is beautifully defined. This will age well.",Riesling
Germany,"Feinherb suggests a style part way between fruchtig and full-blown trocken, and this wine matches the description, finishing almost dry. Slightly minty notes on the nose combine with fla vors of citrus and melon in this lean, crisp Riesling. May be best with seafood dishes.",Riesling
Germany,"From the Liebfrauenstift-Kirchenstück vineyard near Worms, Valckenberg's estate Riesling boasts smoky, minerally aromas and understated fruit this vintage. It's on the full-bodied side, balanced by stony notes and a burst of quince on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Smells ripe, with honey and pear aromas that fold in apples and tangerines. The apples and pears continue on the palate, accented by baking spices—cinnamon, clove and allspice or nutmeg. The acidity is low, making this a candidate to drink now with your favorite Asian cuisine.",Riesling
Germany,"Scents of soft ripe pears are complemented by citrus and floral nuances. Turns spicy and lean on the palate, with flavors of cinnamon and clove making for an almost dusty mouthful that's even a bit austere.",Riesling
Germany,"The name translates as “the slate of Bernkastel” and this wine lives up to its name. Peachy-tropical ripe fruit is offset nicely by the pronounced mineral scent and texture, and a slight spritz. The stony side of its nature glides into a chalk-tinged, palate-cleansing finish with sweet pear flavors.",Riesling
Germany,"Floral and pineapple aromas and a touch of musky spice on the nose open this medium weight Riesling. Shows a slightly lean profile, pear/apple and lemon flavors and a decent acid spine. Turns sharper on the back end with pepper, spice and very tart citrus and green apple notes.",Riesling
Germany,"This has good, juicy fruit, with green apples, green berries, and limes leading the way. There's just a hint of white peaches too, and a full, spicy mouthfeel. It gathers strength in the finish, with hints of anise and herb.",Riesling
Germany,"The smooth, citrus-scented nose that opens this wine shows an interesting, faint candlewax-like note. Vivid, focused fruit follows—kiwi and green berries dominate—with bracing acids and a crisp slatey bottom. Fine balance keeps it light and lively despite the ripe fruit, and it extends into a clean finish of medium length.",Riesling
Germany,"This is solid, journeyman Riesling offering a full grapey bouquet with diesel and earth accents. Grape and mild citrus flavors play on the easy mouthfeel and the decently long, slightly mineral finish.",Riesling
Germany,"This straight-ahead bottling from the Loosen brothers is simply labeled Riesling.It has a surprisingly rich nose with hints of hay, diesel and citrus, while the palate shows ripe, concentrated yellow fruits. Low in alcohol (8.5%) and modest in price, this is a perfect introduction to Mosel Riesling and a great everyday wine for our Chardonnay-obsessed land. Best Buy.",Riesling
Germany,"Crisp and assertive, with boldly fruity aromas of apple, pear, pineapple and melon. No yeastiness to speak of, just bright fruit and froth in a dry, fresh format. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"A nicely complex nose of apple, lemon and herbs gives way to a dry, smooth mouth full of grape flavor. An even, if slightly thin mouthfeel and smooth finish wrap it up nicely. It strikes one that Riesling is the only variety--certainly the variety that most often--does taste like grapes, as opposed to other fruits.",Riesling
Germany,"This rather rustic wine in a round wide ""bock"" bottle has a round mouthfeel, simple and earthy aromas and flavors. But a ripe, fermenting-hay note begins on the nose, continues into the mid-palate where it becomes a musty mature element on the straightforward grape flavors. Still, it might work with sausages or other country fare.",Riesling
Germany,"Slightly toasty on the nose, but there's plenty of fresh fruit as well, ranging from apple to pineapple and tangerine. Clean, fresh and easy to drink and enjoy.",Riesling
Germany,"A decent value in sparkling wine, with pronounced yeasty notes and some green apple flavors delivered via a creamy, medium-bodied wine. Labeled trocken, but tastes slightly off-dry.",Sparkling Blend
Germany,"Clean and freshly fruity, with apple and citrus aromas and flavors leading the way. This is clearly off-dry, but not cloying, instead coming across as soft and easy.",Riesling
Germany,"This fruit-forward, honeyed wine is irresistably drinkable. Has pronounced aromas of baked custard and creme caramel and wildflowers at their scented peak, and drinks vibrantly fruity and rich. Beautiful acidity creates balance.",Riesling
Germany,"Light and frothy, this isn't quite as vinous as the Chardonnay sekt from Am-Turm. Instead, there's ginger, lime and cilantro aromas and wet-stone and lime flavors that finish clean and dry.",Weissburgunder
Germany,"Pleasantly off-dry, with simple, fruity aromas and flavors reminiscent of apple and citrus. A solid choice for an outdoor gathering this summer.",White Blend
Germany,"Starts off slowly, with sulfurous notes that blow off in under an hour to reveal a soft, gentle sekt with mineral and ripe apple flavors.",Riesling
Germany,"Here's a racy Riesling that won't break your budget. Has everything you look for: pretty apple, peach, and honey aromas, with a distinct trace of sun-warmed slate, and long, rich, fruity, flowery flavors. Just a bit off-dry, it's balanced with crisp acidity.",Riesling
Germany,"Tart and very dry, this sparkler appears cleanly made, just somewhat meagrely endowed. Monochromatic—and that's a sour shade of citrus.",Riesling
Germany,"Perfumy on the nose, with scents of lilacs and bubble gum. Light and frothy on the palate, offering soft, slightly sweet flavors reminscent of cotton candy.",Pinot Noir
Germany,"A bit heavy and sweet, with modest pear and melon ¬flavors that fall flat.",Sparkling Blend
Germany,"This is a knockout, from the floral and apricot-laced aromas right through the lingering notes of honey and fruit. It's rich and unctuous on the palate, balancing its considerable residual sugar with only 7% alcohol and crisp, mouthwatering acids. Blends a mélange of fruit—apricots, peaches, pears and apples—with nuances of spice and mineral that no other country in the wine-producing world has yet matched. Like many top German Rieslings, you can drink this now, or enjoy it 20 years from now, and it should last well beyond that. Imported by Classical Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"A bit reticent on the nose, but hints of honeyed fruit and powdered stone emerge after some coaxing. In the mouth, the flavors explode into strident notes of green apple, honey and lime zest, carried easily by only 8% alcohol. Long, tart and refreshing on the finish; a wine that can be consumed in its exuberant youth or aged into something more refined and complex. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts slow, gradually ramping up its complexity and concentration as it warms in the glass, eventually opening up to show scents of diesel and peach pit alongside flavors of lime, peach and melon. Throughout, there's a strong sensation of minerality, ending on a crisp, mouthwatering note. Imported by Classical Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"A nicely balanced auslese that's not too rich or sweet, marrying ripe apples and pears with floral notes, tropical fruit and a healthy dose of crushed-stone minerality. Finishes with flourishes of pineapple and citrus. Imported by Classical Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"Even if it's a bit weighty, this Riesling remains balanced, thanks to intense minerality and crisp acids. Apricot and peach scents on the nose mingle with wet stones and hints of cinnamon, turning slightly oily and viscous on the palate. Finishes dry and clean. Imported by Classical Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"Ripe apples meet oily terpenes in this medium-bodied spätlese. Baked apple and sweet melon notes pick up hints of spice and kerosene on the palate, finishing long and clean. Imported by Chapin Cellars.",Riesling
Germany,"Befitting its namesake Würzgarten vineyard, this wine starts off with musky-spicy notes layered over ripe pear and apple fruit and smoky, slate-driven aromas. It's light in body, yet it doesn't lack for strength or intensity at all, finishing long, with cleansing, lime-like acids. Imported by Loosen Bros. USA.",Riesling
Germany,"Honeyed apples and pears mark the nose of this sweet but balanced auslese. Tasting it reveals hints of dried apricots, cool mint and an earthy minerality, all tied up in a clean, crisp finish. Imported by Chapin Cellars.",Riesling
Germany,"Light and fresh, this spritely kabinett won't bowl you over, but it just may charm you off your feet. Scents of lime and fresh greens lead the charge, backed by crisp apple and citrus flavors. Lively and mouthwatering on the finish. Imported by Chapin Cellars.",Riesling
Germany,"Light and fresh, this tart, strident wine is a poster-child for cool-climate Riesling. Lime, green apple and pineapple aromas and flavors are bold and crisp, tinged with enough slatey minerality to mark its Saar origins. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Unique and idiosyncratic, this extravagantly priced wine certainly makes a statement. Smoky, mineral and spice scents are layered over tropical fruits that range from mango to lychee. Clean and crisp on the finish, without the same length as Bürklin-Wolf's Deidesheimer Hohenmorgen. Imported by Classical Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"A soft, easygoing Riesling that's a nice introduction to the sterner stuff of the Rheingau, this medium-bodied wine offers mouthfilling baked apple and spice flavors to match its broad melon, spice and mineral aromas. Imported by Schmitt-Sohne Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts off with sulfury notes reminiscent of burnt matchstick; slightly rubbery. But with airing, subtle citrus and floral notes emerge, unfolding into baked apple, pear and melon flavors on the palate. This shows balance, elegance and finesse on the crisp, long finish—just give it some time in a decanter if you're going to be drinking it soon. Imported by Chapin Cellars.",Riesling
Germany,"A bit straightforward and simple for what we've come to expect from this producer, with wet slate and honeyed pear aromas that add apple flavors on the palate. It's still very good Riesling, medium-bodied and clean on the finish. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"This slate selection from Kendermanns is a pleasant surprise, speaking of its origins in the smoky, wet slate aromas and stony flavors couched in layers of white peach, melon and hints of honey. Despite a considerable 12.5% alcohol, it seems light and fresh, ending on notes of citrus and melon. Imported by Reh Kendermann GmbH Weinkellerei.",Riesling
Germany,"This wine boasts intense and pure aromas of pear and pineapple, then adds notes of melon and dried spices on the palate. Medium in body and slightly sweet, with a short, crisp finish. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"This fresh, medium-bodied Riesling is clean and fruity, combining flavors of ripe pears and white peaches with hints of apple and slate. Imported by Classical Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"On first glance, this wine comes across as too simple and sweet. But give it some time and a spicy, slatey-minerally compenent emerges, providing balance and complexity to the ripe pear flavors. An estate that seems to be undergoing a bit of a resurgence. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Round and medium-bodied, this relatively low-acid Riesling is soft and easy to drink. Mineral and spice notes accent ripe pear and melon flavors. Drink now. Imported by Loosen Bros. USA.",Riesling
Germany,"Medium in body—and even a bit oily in texture—this amply ripened wine boasts smoky, pungent aromas that veer toward green apple and lime after some airing. It's a bit heavy, but flavorful. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Founded in 1794, Deinhard is an old merchant house—what the French would call a négociant—that markets a wide array of wines. The company's 1808 price list offered 89 different Rhine and Mosel wines, but that's been at least somewhat shortened in recent years. No, it's not that intense, nor does it show a lot of minerality, but this wine ably shows off Mosel Riesling's array of fruity, off-dry flavors, ranging from peach and pear to apple, pineapple and lime. Crisp and clean on the finish.",Riesling
Germany,"Lacks the layered intensity that the 2003 version of this wine showed at this stage, but still delivers stony, minerally aromas and prototypical flavors of green apples and fresh limes. Light in body, but clean and wonderfuly refreshing on the finish. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Relatively light in weight for the Rheingau, with modest pineapple and fern aromas on the nose. Tart and flavorful on the palate, marrying pineapple and green apple flavors that finish crisp and dry. Imported by Schmitt-Sohne Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Breuer's entry-level wine isn't cheap, but it's also pretty good, marrying stony, minty scents with flavors of lime, fresh herbs and wet stones. It's light in body for such an alcoholic Rheingau Riesling, with a clean, fresh finish. Imported by Classical Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"Still a bit sulfury, but otherwise correct, with melon, pear and spice flavors, lithe body and a clean, short finish. Should be better in another year or two. Imported by Palm Bay Imports.",Riesling
Germany,"Starts with slate and lime aromas, adding in modest apple notes on the medium-weight palate. Clean and crisp, just lacks a bit of distinction. Imported by Valckenberg International, Inc.",Riesling
Germany,"Light and very crisp, this wine even boasts hints of retained carbon dioxide to further enliven its mouthfeel. Lime and flint-smoke scents yield to citrusy, stony flavors. Would work well as an apéritif. Imported by Classical Wines.",Riesling
Germany,"Seems slightly disjointed, with pungent diesel aromas on one hand and sweet-tart melon and pear flavors on the other. It's atypically broad in the mouth for Riesling, almost fat, yet closes on a tangy, earthy note. Imported by Schmitt-Sohne Inc.",Riesling
