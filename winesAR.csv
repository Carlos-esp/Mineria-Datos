Argentina,"Smoky aromas of fresh-cut wood blend with berry and cassis form a welcoming, generous bouquet. This feels lively on the palate, albeit tartaric. Oaky plum, cassis and vanilla flavors finish full and agreeable. Drink through 2019.",Malbec
Argentina,"This copper-tinted rosé of Pinot Noir smells like a rubber gym ball and citrus fruits. A full round bouncy palate brings it around, while dry citrus and stone-fruit flavors show a skins-like quality on a steady finish.",Rosé
Argentina,"Aromas of prune, raisin and black plum are full and gritty. A chunky full-bodied palate feels grabby, while this tastes of generic blackberry, burnt coffee and dark chocolate. A steady plump, rubbery finish closes the show.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark, minty, inky aromas of blackberry are rugged. Same for the palate, which is pinched and rubbery, with grabby tannins. Flavors of toasted, blackened berry fruits are chocolaty and well oaked. Raw heat and minty, coffee flavors rev up the finish on this Malbec-led blend.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Dark-berry aromas are crisp and show a note of minerality as well as barrel char. This is firm, juicy and modest in structure, with flavors of blackberry and cassis touched up by some oak. A non-pushy finish with a hint of mocha is a good close.",Malbec
Argentina,"Immediately this smells raisiny, but with time secondary scents of cinnamon and Middle Eastern spices come into play. The body is soft and extracted, with modest acidity. Flavors of baked black fruits, fig paste, chocolate and herbs follow the nose, as does a chocolaty, rich  finish. Drink through 2016.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Open-grain oak aromas are out front, followed by sweeter scents of marzipan, prune and chocolate. A full, tannic palate is deep and dense, while toasty blackened flavors of cassis and blackberry finish with notes of mocha, chocolate and pepper. This is a bit rough and tannic, so cellaring will help it calm down. Drink through 2023.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Although this San Juan SB offers almost nothing on the nose, it's fresh and popping with acidity on the palate. Flavors of briny citrus are entirely familiar, while this finishes with cleansing crispness.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"This boxed Malbec is burgundy-colored and opens with spicy reedy aromas of dried herbs and red-berry fruits. On the palate, this is tight but shallow in the midtier. Flavors of baked plum and berry fruits come with a note of cocoa powder prior to a stable finish.",Malbec

Argentina,"Cherry and plum aromas are earthy, gritty and not overly potent. The palate is saturated, with the right amount of body weight and volume. There's a blitz of berry and black cherry flavors, backed by a finish that's black in nature and shows mild bitter notes of chocolate and coffee.",Malbec
Argentina,"This uniquely tan-colored Torrontés is “orange” in style. Aromas of orange peel, peach, apricot and floor polish are challenging but complex. This immediately turns grabby and astringent on the palate, while stone-fruit and pithy flavors are short, quick and dry.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Gritty aromas of herbal berry fruits and coffee grounds lead to a hard tannic, compact palate with loud acidity. Disparate flavors of burnt coffee, tomato and stewed plum finish with scraping tannins and herbal notes that reflect the nose and palate.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Raspy berry and plum aromas lead to a palate dominated by tartaric acid. That, in turn, leads to sharp berry and plum flavors backed by a bracing finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Basic white-fruit aromas are a bit dusty and yeasty. This feels plump, soft and creamy, with bitter-leaning green melon and papaya flavors. Notes of onion and grape skins rise up on the finish. This is a mix of Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Viognier.",White Blend
Argentina,"Narrow berry aromas are angular and punchy. This feels high in acidity, with hard tannins. That sharp acidity makes for tart unyielding black plum flavors.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend

Argentina,"The color of this Malbec and the legs it gives off help separate it from the pack. A plush nose shows unabsorbed oak and char along with deep berry and cassis notes. Total saturation on the palate matches the nose, and this tastes of chocolate, mocha, wood spice and rich berry fruits. Oak is currently speaking the loudest on the finish. Drink through 2023.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dusty plum and berry aromas are clean. In the mouth, this is hard and wiry. Salty snappy plum flavors dry out and taste a bit like tin on a raw finish.",Malbec

Argentina,"Smooth, earthy, lightly herbal aromas are balanced by fresh red-berry notes. This feels racy and lean in the mouth, with nothing fat or grabby getting in the way of steady raspberry, plum and herbal flavors. A note of olive and leafy green rises up on the finish.",Cabernet Franc
Argentina,"Quara makes good, true Cafayate Torrontés. Aromas of lychee, citrus, tropical fruits and bath oils are vital. This remains solid and clean, with upright acidity. Lime, mango, lychee and banana flavors finish round, with just enough acidity to maintain the wine's character. Drink immediately.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Ripe but subtle aromas of aged balsamic vinegar, blackberry, baked plum and vanilla are alluring and feed into a flush layered palate. Spicy black plum and berry flavors are just rustic and toasty enough, while this blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon with Cab Franc and Merlot tastes peppery, deep, a touch hot and on the money. Drink from 2018–2026.",Cabernet Blend
Argentina,"Eight years down the line and this Malbec shows the flaws caused by a harvest marred by freezes. This smells like a mix of green bean and jammy boysenberry. The palate feels saturated but soupy, with outsize acidity. Green-herb flavors mix with baked plum and blueberry, while the finish feels sticky, tannic and heavy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dusty, generic plum and berry aromas are highly regular. This Malbec is chunky in feel, without much precision. Oaky buttery slightly greasy berry flavors finish hot and creamy, with little to no elegance or cut.",Malbec
Argentina,"This friendly wine offers fresh, jammy berry and cherry aromas. The palate has a bit of grit and stickiness to it, while blackberry, black cherry and boysenberry flavors are ripe, sweet, not pushy and ultimately satisfying.",Malbec
Argentina,"Jammy, soft blueberry aromas are a touch green. This is syrupy, heavy and sticky on the palate, with chocolate, prune and peppery flavors. Tannic and heavy on the finish, this is an overweight Malbec that's lush to the point of being fat.",Malbec
Argentina,"Floral berry, earth and tea aromas are friendly. This Pinot is fresh and perky in feel, with red-fruit and tomato-like acidity pushing flavors of dry cherry, mixed spices, herbs and tomato. This finishes spunky, with crisp acidity and peppery overtones.",Pinot Noir

Argentina,"Raspberry and plum aromas start with a resiny oak covering that turns foresty and briary with airing. This is raisiny and ripe in feel, with a complex mix of berry, fennel and anise flavors. A lush, dense-feeling finish is minty and herbal.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is an unusual, exotic take on Malbec. The bouquet delivers cardamom, sandalwood and spiced black currant aromas. In the mouth, it's grabby with pinching tannins. Blueberry and cardamom flavors end ripe, with decent follow through. Drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"Ripe borderline raisiny aromas include earth, cedar and graphite scents. This is concentrated, grabby and fully extracted. Flavors of jammy black fruits blend with spicy saucy notes prior to a finish with flavors of tomato, herbs, salt and gamy meat. Firm acidity guarantees this will last at least another five years before falling off.",Malbec
Argentina,Gritty aromas suggest burnt popcorn and match stick. This is a round oily style of Torrontés with briny tropical fruit flavors. A salty note of persimmon carries an O.K. finish.,Torrontés
Argentina,"Aromas of roasted but slightly weedy berry fruits, road tar and latex precede a raw shallow pulling palate. This Malbec tastes of salty and savory black plums, tomatoes and herbs. On the finish, this delivers mostly spaghetti-sauce flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"Floral berry and plum aromas are also saucy and oaky, and thus discordant. A wobbly tannic palate with green herbal oaky blueberry flavors tastes grassy on the finish. If you know Casarena's wines, this fits the mold.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,Low-intensity apple and pear aromas lead to a tight high-acid mouth. Severe flavors of lemon and lime are fairly sour. A long direct finish is linear and shearing.,Chenin Blanc
Argentina,"Jammy jumbled foxy aromas set up a blocky flat palate. Greasy flavors of buttered-up berry fruits finish without much verve. This is good enough, but just barely.",Malbec
Argentina,"Berry and plum aromas are spicy and saucy, with secondary notes of tomato and oregano. Snappy on the palate, this live-wire Malbec is a bit aggressive and acidic. Toasty oak and mint flavors accent fresh red-berry fruit prior to an energetic yet woody finish that's raw feeling but fair.",Malbec
Argentina,"Aromas of bath oil and exotic fruits like lychee and mango come in front of a short, simple palate that's fresh. Lychee and mango flavors finish in tropical style, with a mild soapy note. The wine is varietally correct and well done.",Torrontés

Argentina,"Toasty blackberry and prune are the key aromas on this plush Cabernet. A generous mouthfeel includes choppy tannins that will mellow in due time. Dark flavors of cassis and blackberry include spice and chocolate notes, while this finishes with ripe flavors of blackberry touched up by chocolaty oak. Drink this calm, slightly flabby Cab through 2021.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Compact aromas of red berries get a boost from oak-based coconut, cedar and graphite notes. This is a blend of three Malbec vineyards of varying elevations; it's bursting with acidity, while high-toned plum and currant flavors are a touch salty. A lively, fiery finish is fueled by latent acidity. Drink through 2020.",Malbec

Argentina,"Herbal and foresty up front, this Bordeaux blend smells of fig, caramel and berry fruits. Big, tannic and chunky on the palate, this has toasty, chocolaty, burnt flavors and a blackened finish. This offers a lot of power and fruit but it's brusk.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Jammy cassis, blackberry and foxy aromas define the nose on this lush, almost ponderous blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Petit Verdot. There's flatness to the palate along with flavors of blackbery, plum and dark, minty oak. A heavy, grabby finish is bold and voluminous.",Red Blend
Argentina,"There's a mix of herbal aromas and raisin on this blend of Malbec, Merlot, Cab Sauvignon and Syrah. In the mouth, it's edgy and rubbery, with rock-hard tannins. Flavors of baked black fruits, tobacco and citrus peel finish raw and rubbery. This will need a lot of air and also hearty  food to show its better side.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Unconvincing aromas are hard to describe. This Malbec sparkler is coarse and foamy on the palate, with burnt peppery slightly bitter flavors of orange and grapefruit.",Sparkling Blend
Argentina,"Sharp red-fruit aromas include notes of vinegar and asphalt. Angular and bumpy on the palate, this is tart and foxy tasting, with a sour, herbal finish.",Malbec-Bonarda
Argentina,This gold-colored stale-smelling Torrontés smells like old apple juice. A chunky flat palate offers bland oxidized bitter flavors. Remnants of apple barely help a bitter finish.,Torrontés
Argentina,"This blend smells outright herbaceous and weedy. An astringent volatile palate is grating, while this tastes much like it smells: weedy and green.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Earthy, spicy aromas of juniper, bell pepper and oak cover up slightly underripe berry scents. This has an acceptable level of tannic scratch and peppery, herbal berry fruit flavors. Like the rest of this Cab, the finish is lightly herbal, green-leaning and hard.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Lean, green and mild, it's aromatically earthy and low on fruit. In the mouth, it's medium-bodied, with herbal, raspberry and red plum flavors. Peppery spice, a green note and raw heat drive the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dense mossy aromas of blackberry are slightly murky. Forget about delicacy on the palate, this is full-bodied and clattering. Blackberry, cassis, black cherry and chocolate flavors finish spicy. This is at maximum ripeness. Drink through 2022.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dense aromas of fig, prune, cassis and blackberry are more mellow than monstrous. In the mouth, this Cabernet feels chunky, ripe and fully tannic. Savory berry fruit flavors and notes of cured meats and jerky finish a bit flat, with a lasting flavor of oaky chocolate. Drink through 2022.",Cabernet Sauvignon

Argentina,"Slightly baked aromas of raisin, blackberry and caramel are deep and dense more than bright. This Malbec blend is well built, with spicy flavors of berry fruits and cocoa. The oak on the finish is toasty and leads to dryness and a sense of fineness. Drink through 2023.",Malbec Blend
Argentina,"This ripe Malbec offers jammy blueberry aromas that hint at raisin but pull back in the nick of time. A round pulpy palate is home to black cherry, berry and plum flavors supported by loamy earthy notes. A fleshy finish isn't exact but it's friendly. Drink through 2019.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lychee and melon aromas are proper for Torrontés. And while this has Viognier and Chardonnay in the blend, it's Torrontés that dominates via a spritzy, citrusy mouthfeel and flavors of lychee, nectarine and citrus fruits. A fresh, lively but simple finish confirms the wine's refreshment potential.",White Blend
Argentina,"Subtle aromas of minerals, rose petal and red berry are not overdone. In the mouth, it has astringency, hard tannins and an overall narrow feel. Flavors of raspberry and red plum seem sharp and jagged, while oaky mint and heat rise up on the finish. Give this more bottle time and it may improve.",Malbec

Argentina,"Initially, this blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Tannat smells murky, leathery and nutty, but with airing it settles and cleans up. Chunky and close to being oversaturated, this full-bodied red tastes of loamy berry and raisin, while the finish is weighty.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Powdery lychee and crystallized mango aromas feed into a texturally good palate with mild oily notes and good acidity. Orange, mango and lychee flavors are straight from the textbook, while lychee is the clearest lasting flavor on the finish. Drink with Indian or spicy Asian foods.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Oaky up front, with aromas of animal, tar and medicinal red-berry fruits, this Petit Verdot is grabby and hard in feel, with a mix of oak, cough drop, berry and peppery flavors. It's big and sticky but solid on the finish.",Petit Verdot
Argentina,"Plum and berry aromas are mildly jammy. This is fast moving on the palate, with racy acidity pushing berry flavors that veer toward tartness but pull back in time. An aggressive finish is also almost sour but not, while oaky coffee and bitter chocolate flavors wrap it up.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Spunky, youthful aromas of wild berry and currant are aggressive but fresh in style. This is a juicy, forward, bright Malbec with boysenberry flavors followed by a short wave of bitter chocolate and toast. It finishes in the same style.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is a more rustic, woody Cabernet than many from Mendoza. The nose suggests asphalt, herbs and spice more than bright fruit. A tannic yet solid body and flavors of coffee, herbs lead to a finish that tastes dry and a bit hollow, with coffee and cocoa notes.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Ripe grapy aromas are more chunky than mammoth. Saturated and muscular on the palate, this tastes of roasted salty blackberry, while the finish is full and meaty in both flavor and texture. Drink this stout full-bodied Malbec through 2022.",Malbec
Argentina,"Ripe blackberry and cassis aromas are toasty at first, then charred as this breathes. A big grabby palate is muscled up but welcoming. Toasty blackberry and cassis flavors remain charred on a loaded lengthy finish. This is Malbec and Petit Verdot fermented and aged together. Drink through 2022.",Malbec-Petit Verdot

Argentina,"Mint and graphite aromas make for a cool nose on this 50/50 Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon. Rubbery tannins mixed with extracted berry flavors create more noise than poise on the palate. A spicy, herbal, chocolaty finish is punchy and borderline punishing.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Berry and cassis aromas turn more saucy with airing. This has a sticky mouthfeel with protruding acids, while flavors of plum and citrus finish short. This is good if you're looking for the basics.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Boysenberry and exotic notes of all-spice and cardamom set this Malbec apart from the field. In the mouth, this is typically angular, with sharp acidity and not much cushion. A one-note, linear flavor of rooty plum is neither fruity nor dry, while the finish fails to rise or fall; it just hums along on a singular beam of acid. Drink from 2018–2030.",Malbec
Argentina,"Firm dark-berry aromas come with cola and leafy notes that feel tannic and gripping but alive. Big berry and black plum flavors are leafy and spicy in style. It finishes tight, but should open and relax with a bit of time in the glass, and would go well with pizza and burgers.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Initial charred aromas yield to aggressive cherry and maple scents. This is a wide, fully tannic load of a Malbec with toasty flavors of burnt wheat bread and maple to go with blackberry and cassis. Toast remains on the finish, which also tastes of licorice. Drink through 2023.",Malbec
Argentina,"Berry and cassis aromas turn more saucy with airing. This has a sticky mouthfeel with protruding acids, while flavors of plum and citrus finish short. This is good if you're looking for the basics.",Cabernet Sauvignon

Argentina,"Dark in color, with rooty, leafy aromas of berry fruits that turn flatter with airing, this warm-style Pinot Noir feels wide and grabby, with some flab on its hips. Black plum and toasty flavors simmer on an dull, weighty finish.",Pinot Noir

Argentina,"Candied red-fruit aromas are thin and limited. This is edgy, rubbery and tannic in feel, with rudimentary raspberry and red-plum flavors. A juicy finish is lean and tastes medicinal.",Malbec

Argentina,"This overoaked Malbec smells almost entirely of clove and chocolate. It's bulky and creamy in feel, with bland, stewy berry flavors and a blanket of oaky clove. Oak spice and heat control the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Roasted, barnyard, leathery aromas of lemony oak and tomato are far from ideal. This has a scratchy, tartaric feel to it, while herbal raspberry flavors are backed by a mulchy aftertaste. It's stewed on the finish and weedy.",Malbec
Argentina,Flower and hay aromas lead to simple pear and spice flavors in this basic white. Mild woody notes show on the finish. Drink now.,Chardonnay

Drink through 2020.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is a potent brew with complexities galore, but there's also a simplicity about it that's appealing. Its raw size is bracing, but the structure and fabric of this Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon scream balance.

Argentina,"Raw herbal spicy aromas come with a heavy draping of savory oak. This Bonarda feels full, rustic and a touch creamy. Dry spicy barrel-heavy flavors outweigh fruit on this oaky smoky red wine.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Resiny oak sticks out, while the palate is grabby and sticky in feel. This tastes like lemony pushcart hotdogs and the briny water they sit in, followed by a woody, low-fruit finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,Grapy candied berry aromas mix with loud oak that smells like clove and mint. This has a narrow astringent mouthfeel and strange-tasting berry flavors that end with a rugged finish.,Malbec
Argentina,"This is overripe and raisiny, no two ways about it. Hailing from a very hot year, this feels flat and flabby, while raisin and prune are the dominant flavors. Blatant overripeness and a ton of weight render this out of balance.",Malbec
Argentina,"Minty, ultraripe blackberry aromas are alluring but ultimately familiar if you know the Cobos style. Ditto the palate, which is rich, thick, chewy and full of creamy oak and black-fruit flavors. This blend of 81% Cabernet Sauvignon and 19% Malbec finishes smooth and creamy, with good balance for what amounts to a very ripe wine. Drink through 2018.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"Deep berry aromas combine seamlessly with sweet notes of marzipan and complex accents of balsam wood on what is an inviting, rich nose. This is rewardingly bright and structured on the palate, where blackberry, boysenberry and plum flavors carry onto a full, long finish. This is high-end, ripe Malbec. Drink through 2018.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is textbook juice for the cellar. A cool, herbal nose turns cedary and stout. It's wall-to-wall tannins now, with complex flavors of red fruits mingling with tomato leaf, oregano, spice and tobacco (reflections of the 40% Cabernet Sauvignon that goes with more familiar Malbec). A bullish finish with mild green notes should soften with aging. Drink from 2014 to 2021.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Foresty earthy aromas of raisin, tobacco and dried leaves are particular to this San Rafael wine. In the mouth, this shows gaps and holes. A flavor profile driven by oak and tobacco doesn't allow for much fruit. Spice, cocoa and earthy notes control the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rarely do you come across something like this: mature and complex Malbec from Cafayate. Earthy aromas of plum, prune, raisin and tobacco give this an Old World bouquet. Saturated but with enough acidity to maintain balance, this tastes rooty, chocolaty and earthy, with mocha, toast and toffee flavors on a heady finish. Drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"Herbal berry aromas suggest density, and this is certainly dark full-sized and sticky. Pumped-up candied black-fruit flavors are thick and gooey, with cooked brown sugar, mint and toast flavors on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Aromas of spearmint gum along with a weird coating of oak create a challenging nose. This is high in acidity, to the point of feeling shearing. Sour herbal plum flavors finish rough and bracing.",Malbec
Argentina,Odd aromas of bath soap and tropical fruits are not convincing for Chardonnay. A narrow diluted palate offers low-level lemon and tropical-fruit flavors in front of a sour underwhelming finish.,Chardonnay
Argentina,"Muddy plum and berry aromas lead to a sharp, rugged palate. Tart plum and pie cherry flavors end raw, rough and bitter.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cidery, citric and jumbled on the nose and palate, this is barely cutting it. Briny, limited flavors of mealy citrus fruits finish flat.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Herbaceous red-fruit and forced fiery oak aromas give this a spicy, almost Pinot Noir-like nose. Raw as nails on the palate, this tastes like herbal green strawberry and chemicals. Weedy on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rarely does one come across a new-release Argentinean red with this much age (it was bottled in 2008). Aromas of turned earth, sautéed mushroom, tomato and herbs are like a fine spaghetti sauce. In the mouth, this is firm and tannic, with lasting balance. Flavors of coffee, cinnamon, dry raspberry and spiced plum finish with persistence. Drink now through 2019.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Deep, lush aromas of black fruits, graphite and coconut are welcoming and friendly. The mouthfeel is pure and smooth, with elegance and power. Flavors of cassis, blackberry, hard spices and licorice filter into a long, mellow, classy finish. This is a pushy, full-bodied wine that doesn't throw punches; drink through 2020.",Malbec
Argentina,"This driving blend of Malbec with Syrah and Cabernet hails from Argentina's most northern vineyards.Bruising black plum and cassis aromas have mossy, floral sidenotes. It's grapy but not monotone, so you get boysenberry then spice flavors, especially clove. This is toasty on the finish, which has drying tannins.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Deep and dense from head to toe, this Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend opens with heavy, loamy black-fruit aromas along with coconut, graphite, cedar and tobacco scents. A definitively rich and chewy palate is tannic and heady but cushioned, while baked, toasty blackberry flavors come with vanilla and marzipan notes and an inky, chewy, thick finish. Drink through 2019.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Rich, lusty aromas of blackberry, graham cracker and coconut are hard-driving in this blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot. It's oaky and full of coconut, vanilla, blackberry and toasted marshmallow flavors. Ripe and oaky on the finish, it also offers coffee, mocha and chocolate notes. Drink through 2020.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Alto is 75% Malbec and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon. The nose is cool and full of cassis, blackberry, cola and cedar aromas. This is ripe as they come without losing freshness; flavors of loamy berry and cassis finish with density along with prune and spicy, peppery flavors. Drink through 2020.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Chunky black-fruit aromas are ripe but familiar, meaning the nose is pumped full of richness and oak. Racy acidity on the palate gives this modern Cab spine, while in the mouthfeel stays on the fast track due to zesty acidity. Flavors of cassis and blackberry register as fresh and ripe, and the finish is crisp and not the least bit flabby. Drink through 2016.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dry oak, black fruit and floral notes suggestive of violet are the aromas that set off this tannic, clamping, deeply structured Malbec. Flavors of mocha, maple, savory blackberry and roasted plum end with a mix of creaminess and strapping tannins. Drink through 2025.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is one of the top Malbecs from Neuquén and it's under $20. The bouquet is focused, dark and loaded with inky berry aromas and graphite. The palate is deep and layered, and full bodied, with blackberry, chocolate and coffee flavors. A long, spicy, toasty finish is warming but not hot. Drink through 2017.",Malbec
Argentina,"Jammy raisiny berry aromas are soft and a bit flabby. In the mouth, this is dense, jammy and fleshy. Roasted plum and berry flavors carry a salted note, while this holds steady on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"The old-vines Linda vineyard Malbec is a particular wine, one that shows a high herbal, almost weedy nose that's heavy with tomato leaf. This is choppy and bumpy on the palate. Spicy red-berry and tomato flavors finish with pulling tannins and a lasting herbal character.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tropical aromas are a tiny bit grassy and oily. In the mouth, this is acidic and tangy, while lime and green-herb flavors are snappy. Crisp citric acidity creates sizzle on a racy finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Tropical aromas are a tiny bit grassy and oily. In the mouth, this is acidic and tangy, while lime and green-herb flavors are snappy. Crisp citric acidity creates sizzle on a racy finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"nky aromas of raspberry and blackberry. This shows firm acids and a racy, aggressive palate. Flavors of black fruits, espresso, lemon peel and salt finish peppery and with a licorice note. Give this wine two years and it should  be less choppy and more balanced. Best from 2015–2020.",Malbec
Argentina,"This huge Malbec defines jammy and concentrated. The bouquet is ripe, soft and minty, while the palate echoes the nose with thickness and density. Flavors of prune, raisin, tea and blackberry are borderline syrupy, while the finish is smooth and pure but doesn't offer much spine or foundation. Drink this modern Malbec sooner rather than later.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is always one of Mendoza's classiest blends. There's big fruit, dry wood, bacon and balsamic notes on the alluring bouquet. Full, elastic tannins support cassis and berry flavors as well as more than enough oak. This is dry, lightly herbal, powerful and saucy tasting on the finish. 60% Malbec, 30% Bonarda and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Red Blend
Argentina,"This fruit-driven, minerally Malbec hails from the Altamira section of Mendoza's Uco Valley. Blueberry, cassis and stony aromas feed into a deep, pure palate with plenty to offer. Flavors of cassis, blackberry, peppercorn and exotic spices finish with moderate tannins and flavors of fig and black pepper. Drink through 2019.",Malbec
Argentina,Lightly herbal berry and plum aromas are uncomplicated. A medium-full palate tastes of generic berry fruits and plum. Rubbery tannins make for a tight drawing finish.,Malbec
Argentina,"Rubbery generic berry aromas are more damp than bright. This feels drying and scrubbing due to rough tannins. Toasty black-plum flavors are short and foresty, while this tastes toasty on a dry finish.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,Buttercup and tropical fruit aromas are related to the 80% Torrontés in this blend (Viognier and Chardonnay are 10% each). This is plump but also high in acidity. Salty flavors of tropical fruits and pink grapefruit are retained on the finish.,White Blend
Argentina,"This classy Cabernet marks a high point for Salentein. On the nose, it's redolent of oak grain, tobacco, vanilla and all sorts of berry fruits. The palate is full, ripe and solid as an ox. Spiced berry, tobacco and cedary flavors finish dry, sturdy and lightly herbal. Drink through 2022.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This reflects the big, modern style of Mendoza Malbec. The bouquet is ripe and hefty, with coconut, mint, blackberry and almond cookie aromas. Expect thick, rugged tannins along with toasty flavors of black coffee, chocolate and mint. A dark, fruity finish is more subtle and harmonious than specific. Drink through 2018.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smoke and burnt rubber are prominent aromas. This PV feels grabby and pushy, with hard tannins. Creamy candied-berry flavors are sweet and chocolaty, while this tastes of oak, caramel and vanilla on the finish.",Petit Verdot
Argentina,"Leather, blueberry, blackberry and mild herbal notes make for a rich, ribald bouquet. Given the nose, it's no surprise that this Malbec is dense, jammy and a bit oversaturated in the mouth. Flavors of blackberry, prune, mint and graphite finish with lushness. Drink now through 2016.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smoky, roasted aromas of black fruits, bacon and herbs are the kickoff. The mouthfeel is plump and full but offers vital acidity at its core. Flavors of black plum, hoisin sauce and savory spices finish smoky and ripe, with a lasting note of bacon. Drink through 2018.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smoke and burnt rubber are prominent aromas. This PV feels grabby and pushy, with hard tannins. Creamy candied-berry flavors are sweet and chocolaty, while this tastes of oak, caramel and vanilla on the finish.",Petit Verdot
Argentina,"Wiry, slightly grassy aromas of raspberry and plum come with a touch of oaky vanilla. This Malbec feels downright hard and choppy due to tough gritty tannins. Plum and berry flavors come in blips rather than a harmonious whole, and this tastes of lactic oak and rubber on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Grapy oaky aromas of blackberry and baked plum include a note of prune. This is full and dense in feel, with blackberry, prune and chocolate flavors. A grapy finish is chewy, a bit tannic, and roasted in flavor.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sweet oak and vanilla aromas are front and center on a jammy bouquet that also features black plum and blackberry scents. This blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Tannat feels full, lifted and balanced. Ripe, enticing flavors of wild berry and cassis are backed by toast, chocolate, vanilla and coconut notes as well as heat and burn. Drink through 2019.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Intriguing aromas of lavender, hoja santa and green tobacco blend nicely with blackberry and blueberry scents. This top-flight Bonarda feels lush and only moderately tannic. Blackberry, leather and mild briny flavors finish minty and lightly herbal. Drink now.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Blackberry and rubber aromas are friendly and forward, with spice added in for good measure. Feels full, lush and cushioned, with integrated tannins, good acidity and bright red berry flavors dusted by herbs and spice. Finishes smooth and true. A winning wine from a difficult vintage.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cherry, sweet berry and citrus peel aromas come in front of a full, slightly oaky palate with sweet plum and berry flavors. There's some length to the finish and more flavors of sweet, creamy but nicely applied oak.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Earthy and a bit foresty on the nose, with a leather accent to the berry aromas. Full and reasonably sound across the palate, which offers baked berry and coffee flavors in front of a modest, leathery finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Spicy dark fruit aromas include notes of tobacco and mint along with mustard and/or horseradish. The palate is big and tannic, with a rough feel showcasing round, chunky berry and cassis flavors. Stays rough and tannic on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Solid, familiar berry and plum aromas carry some sweetness and vanilla. The palate, however, is fairly acidic and tight, with a piercing center and snappy, almost tart flavors of raspberry and red plum. Crisp and sheering on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cherry and mild leather aromas are inviting, while the medium-bodied palate, despite having some bite and edge, is topped off with cassis, cherry and light medicinal flavors. A bright wine with lively acidity and touches of oak, butter and vanilla on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Exotic smelling, with Middle Eastern spice aromas, blueberry and herbs. Highly acidic and spiky in the mouth, with cassis and blackberry flavors in front of an aggressive finish that smolders with heat. Dense but awkward, with forceful acidity.",Petit Verdot
Argentina,"Tropical aromas of lychee and melon are bright but a little oily. The palate is round and honest in feel and acidity, with pineapple, lemon, tangerine and lychee flavors. Sweet and spunky on the finish; drink immediately.",Torrontés
Argentina,"A bit warm and baked on the nose, with aromas of fruit cake and pastry. The palate is full-bodied and chewy, with ripe, sweet black fruit flavors that finish with vanilla and chocolate.",Malbec-Tempranillo
Argentina,"Seems like quality and character are slipping a bit on this Malbec, which a few years ago overdelivered but is now more average. Red licorice, strawberry and sweetness characterize the nose. The palate is sweet and generic, while the finish is pretty much the same. Perfectly good but not the gem it used to be.",Malbec
Argentina,"A thick, dark and slightly raisiny nose features licorice and smoke. It's a full, beefy Malbec with herbal berry flavors and a finish that sweetens up like syrup but also gets more herbal. Powerful but more rustic than polished.",Malbec
Argentina,"Blackberry and other sweet aromas lead to a soft, mildly oaky palate with sweet, ripe plum and berry flavors. There's juicy acids and reasonable amounts of toast, licorice and spice on the finish. Not sure what differentiates this from Reserve, but the Barrel Select seems better balanced.",Merlot
Argentina,"Ripe and clean smelling, with berry fruit aromas and a pinch of spice. The palate is medium-bodied and just dense enough, with dark, slightly roasted flavors of blackberry and plum. Fresh and tight; covers the basics.",Malbec
Argentina,"This big boy brings the weight. It's loaded with blackberry, rubber and sweet baking spices on the nose. Feels like it went through max extraction with its mouthfilling tannins and density. Tastes a bit exotic, with pure blackberry and blueberry fruit. Finishes lush and soft.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smells earthy and baked, with bulk to the bouquet and a gaseous quality that blows off with time. Feels chunky, grabby and tannic, with fully ripe flavors of jammy blackberry. Pours on the heft and broad tannins, but comes up a little short in the nuance and character categories. Drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"A smooth Cab with cola, vanilla, black cherry and sweet berry aromas. Shows body and build, with wild berry flavors bolstered by ample oak yielding related spice and chocolate. Dark, spicy and showing a hint of herbs on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Not every vintage is ideal, and the '07 version of Alfa Crux, while still very good, is not on a par with prior years. Smells brushy and roasted. The palate feels edgy and the flavors are rooty, sweet and baked, with prune-like fruit and pepper accents. Tastes rustic on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"A huge success given the price. Impeccably smooth on the bouquet, with clean yet generous berry aromas. Ripe and balanced, with bright berry and chocolaty oak flavors. Solid on the finish, with lasting plum and berry flavors. Satisfying in every way.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"This small-lot Bonarda is one of Argentina's bright examples of the variety. It's ripe but brushy smelling, with chocolate and vanilla aromas blending with blackberry and herbs. Feels super fresh and juicy, with boysenberry, blackberry and chocolaty flavors. Very good overall.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Slightly oily, nutty and harsh on the initial nose, but better as it opens and airs out. The body here is good and has balance, depth and substance, and the flavors of lychee, mango and other tropical fruits ring true. Persistent on the finsh, with good structure and length.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Concentrated, with plenty of aromatic richness and dark fruit aromas of blackberry and cassis. The palate features proper extraction and weight, with forceful, powered-up flavors of wild berry and toast. Solid on the finish, with good ending weight and legs.",Malbec
Argentina,"A bit fleshy and melony on the nose, and also flowery. The palate has a full feel despite present acids, and the apple and citrus palate is clean and slightly green. Shows all the basics on a sweet, soft frame.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Smells good, with berry- dominated aromas. The palate is solid but acidic at the core, with sharpness on the palate that creates a juicy, crisp set of raspberry and plum flavors. Flattens out on the finish, where moderate oak-based butter notes rise up.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Giant and black, with extracted but pruney aromas that are sweet and raisiny. The palate is chunky, with raisin, fig and black plum flavors. Sweet but falls flat on the finish; has its good qualities but frankly it's an overripe wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"A blend of 50% Malbec with Cabernet, Syrah and Merlot that's lightly minty and full of tobacco, pepper and spicy aromas. Feels a bit clampy and tannic, with oaky, herbal flavors of plum and sweet berry. Shows a hint of green and drying tannins on the finish.",Red Blend
Argentina,"For an under-$15 red blend, Corte has it going on. It's rich and full, almost syrupy on the nose, with lots of oak, ink and vanilla. Shows power and packs a punch, with dark berry, chocolate and spicy flavors. A little tannic and scratchy, but with structure and framework to spare. Malbec (80%), with Bonarda and Petit Verdot.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Leather, berry, earth, raisin and roasted qualities define the nose on this Tempranillo-led blend of four grapes. Feels good in the mouth, with active raspberry, plum and coffee flavors that comes with a roasted accent. Mildly leafy, baked and woody on the thorough finish.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Ripe and open on the nose, with lush blueberry aromas mixed with vanilla and tobacco. Feels medium to full but not heavy, with raspberry, red apple skin, coconutty oak and spice for flavors. Almondy and sweet on the finish, with handsome dry spice.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dry and balsamic on the bouquet, with earthy, mellow berry aromas that do not push. In the mouth, it comes across charred and roasted, with baked, chocolaty, leafy accents on top of core red fruit flavors. Turns more leafy and charred as it unfolds, with a forward finish. Malbec with Cab Sauvignon and Merlot.",Red Blend
Argentina,"There's a ton of oak on this Malbec, but there's also enough body and richness to handle it. The wine smells minty and dark, with shoe polish and chocolate aromas. Tight and acidic on the tongue, with an oak-led set of flavors that includes coconut, vanilla and butter along with blackberry. Prickly and electric due to high acidity, but quite good as a whole.",Malbec
Argentina,"A medium-weight Cabernet with plum, prune, tobacco and herb aromas. Features average weight and body, with a creamy texture and layered flavors of black fruit, raspberry and spice. Finishes with herb and plum notes as well as a pinch of tobacco.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A bit grapey and jammy on the nose, with a slight hint of bramble and stem. It's solid in the mouth, with kick and sweet berry fruit flavors. On the finish it falls off some, leaving a mildly candied aftertaste. Not perfect but overall it's a well-made blend of 85% Malbec with Cab and Syrah filling things out.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Cedar, graphite, marzipan, black plum and blackberry aromas ooze power and ripeness. This is concentrated and dark in style, with oaky blackberry and cassis flavors. Spice, vanilla, raisin, cassis and chocolate flavors reflect maximum ripeness, while the finish is dense, layered and potent. Drink this hefty, extracted Malbec through 2020.",Malbec
Argentina,"This starts out with textbook aromas of red and black fruits that are pure and easy to get into. It shows kick on the palate, with oaky flavors of coffee and chocolate that accent ripe berry and mild herb notes. It's toasty and spicy on the finish, with a gritty feel.",Malbec
Argentina,"Potent and herbal, this has aromas of tomato, olive, mineral and tobacco. It feels tight, drying and lively, with herb-infused flavors of plum and berry along with spicy oak. Rich in feel, but it's distinctly foresty and herbal tasting on the finish. This is 100% Malbec with an undeniable Salta imprint.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rubbery and warm on the nose, with earthy plum and blackberry aromas. The palate is full and bouncy, with appropriate plum, berry and cassis flavors. Nice for standard New World Cab, with fig, chocolate and no buttery, sloppy oak.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Meaty, herbal aromas are a bit rooty and mossy but with time they offer up berry fruit and spice. The palate is full and plump, and also a little hard and tannic, while the flavors suggest prune and cassis. Spicy and with good feel to the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Much better than prior vintages, when it was known as Finca El Portillo. The nose is jammy and shows black fruit aromas, while the palate is complete and full but juicy, with plum and black cherry flavors. Pepper and toast flavors infiltrate the finish.",Merlot
Argentina,"Raspberry, plum and subtle oak aromas lead to a snappy, crisp, high-acid palate with pie cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. There isn't much finish or extras here; basic and well cut.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"An intimidating wine in that it's dark, huge and heavy. The nose is a roasted mass of tar, rubber, smoke and baked berry fruit. It's thick and fleshy in the mouth, with flavors of cola, chocolate, blackberry and blueberry. Minty and warm late, and overall it's more about color and size than refinement.",Malbec
Argentina,"Aromas of mocha, rubber, smoky leather and berry fruit indicate good things to come, but in the mouth this wine fails to deliver equal to its price and the previous successes of Trapiche's single-vineyard Malbec project. Scouring acidity is the main culprit; the wine seems clipped, tartaric and angular, thus it's all superficial and not deep or rich enough to rate better.",Malbec
Argentina,"Initially it gives off murky, soupy aromas. But with airing it rounds into form, displaying prune and oak scents in front of a round, soft, stewy palate of chunky berry flavors. Gets better with time before finishing with toast, herbal notes and tobacco. Offers more highs than lows.",Merlot
Argentina,"A black-fruit aroma comes with accents of tobacco and prune but also a strong, almost vegetal green angle. It feels nice and full, with green-leaning flavors of spiced berry and juniper. Tobacco, bitter lettuce and green bean notes all make appearances on the finish. This is a blend of 80% Malbec and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Red Blend
Argentina,"This is dusty and smooth up front, with plenty of oak, balsamic, plum and berry aromas. Showing overall harmony, it feels sure and secure, with depth and solid flavors of toasty berry and bitter chocolate. It tastes similarly on the finish, with a jammy feel. A blend of 80% Malbec with 10% Bonarda and 10% Syrah.",Red Blend
Argentina,"For everyday Argentine Malbec, Trivento has the formula down. Round, smoky and full of berry fruit, with freshness, ample oak, and a smattering of herbs to go with more familiar plum and cherry components. A little generic, but good for the price. 41,000 cases made.",Malbec
Argentina,"Neutral on the nose except for some oak and floral notes. The palate is fleshy and a bit hollow in feel, with peach and sweet, almost sugary melon and pineapple flavors. Finishes like a melon ball, but at least the mouthfeel is good and not flabby.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Sweet berry aromas are a bit warm and herbal, while the palate has good feel and soft, earthy flavors of herbs and generic berry fruit. Light on the finish, with a slight leafy note. Has good mouthfeel and doesn't overdo it.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark, smoky aromas suggest prune, licorice, coconut and shoe polish. The palate is sharper than the color would indicate, while flavors of dark berry, licorice and plum vie with oak then bitterness. Pinched and tangy at points, but balanced by oaky softness. 65% Malbec with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Light and red in style, with food-friendly acidity and good overall balance and presence. Has sheer qualities and crisp fruit flavors, but it's not sour or too edgy. Smells like Pinot and tastes like it, too.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Light and airy, with almost neutral aromas except for some lemon. The palate is round and offers good acids that propel green apple and lime flavors. A basic wine with light aromatics and proper flavors.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Tropical and zesty on the nose, with a big shot of lemon blossom and a secondary note of melon. The palate is juicy, fresh and sort of lean, with lemon, pineapple and green apple flavors. Arguably tart and angular, but at least it's clean and crisp.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"This vintage of Broquel reflects the cool, challenged characteristics of the '08 vintage. It has snap and berry aromas and flavors along with obvious oak, char and mocha. The palate is more driving and linear than previous years, with juicy, snappy cherry and wood at the base. Finishes with coffee, toast and controlled bitterness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tropical and toasty, with buttercup and banana on the nose. Good acidity keeps the palate zesty and moving forward, while the flavors of lemon, lime and pineapple are juicy and clean. Good in a fresh and simple way, with just a spot of oak character.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Borderline heavy, with stewy black fruit aromas that turn savory then murky and gaseous. The palate has clacky acidity and flavors of sweet, roasted berry fruits. Lasting on the finish, with citric acidity that seems as though it was forced onto the wine. 50% Malbec with 30% Cabernet and 10% each Syrah and Merlot.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Fruity and forward, but airing allows restraint and character to emerge. Still, this is a red-blooded red wine with racy fruit, plenty of freshening acids, pepper and bitter chocolate at the end. Best in late 2008 into 2009.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is a jammy, dense and pure Cabernet, with meat and berry aromas that mix in touches of graphite and chocolate. It feels a little hard and acidic despite its size, while the flavor profile is of mossy berry fruit and chocolate. Tight and nervy, this offers lots of acidic push on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Full and fruity, with a dusty edge to the nose and accents of black pepper. Fairly thick and textured on the palate, with a freshness of fruit that works well on the palate. Blackberry, licorice and floral elements all add to the wine's appeal.",Malbec
Argentina,"A little funky and animal-like upon opening, but meatier and better later on. The palate is ripe and slightly medicinal, with drawn plum and berry flavors riding on a wave of hard tannins. Dark toffee and chocolate flavors on the finish, but also some heat.",Malbec
Argentina,"If you like Italian Moscato d'Asti, then think of this as a distant cousin. It's made from the Torrontés grape and it features sweet, tropical aromas of lychee and air freshener. The palate pushes more lychee and apricot, while the finish is where the sweetness really settles in. A classic no-brainer bubbly for receptions and parties involving cake and other sweets.",Torrontés
Argentina,"A ripe, modern success with everything a fan of New World reds might want. The nose is floral and beautiful, with fine oak scents supporting brilliant raspberry, plum and spice aromas. It's deep, smooth and pressing in the mouth, with a delicious set of blackberry, coconut, vanilla and creamy flavors. A beauty to drink now through 2017.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Is there a better, more consistent Malbec on the market today than Punto Final? The 2005 is typically rich and dense, with saturated berry aromas and a strong but balanced oak element. The palate is a potpourri of berries, chocolate and vanilla, while the mouthfeel is juicy and stacked. Quite delicious; this is the type of wine that gives Argentine Malbec its good name.",Malbec
Argentina,"Purple as can be, with a loaded bouquet of black fruit and oak. This is your classic heavyweight, and while 2004 was not a great vintage in Mendoza, this wine still shows excellent depth, weight and balance. Firm on the finish, with big tannins and grab. Production was only 175 cases; drink now–2009. Imported by Southern Wine Group.",Malbec
Argentina,"Familiar aromas of lemon blossom and air freshener get it going, and all together it smells a lot like a bathroom cleanser. Later on it shifts to lean, lemony, citrus fruits, with lime sticking out. Good and racy in the mouth, with another squeeze of lime juice on the finish. Good for Torrontés but with limits.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Savory, baked cassis and blackberry aromas show form and solidity, while the palate is deep and a little soft, with lush, slightly roasted berry and black currant aromas. Chocolaty on the finish yet not too heavy or forced. Not all that Syrah-like but it still smells and tastes good.",Syrah
Argentina,"One sniff tells you plenty: there's attractive spice, coffee and leather to go with rich molasses and broad black-fruit aromas. The palate maintains balance due to fine, fresh acidity, and the flavor profile brings mocha, coffee, berry, plum and toast. Delicious, deep, layered and refined. Will age for at least 5–6 years, but best from 2012–2014.",Malbec
Argentina,"Attractive and well put together from start to finish. This Cab (with 15% Malbec) is jammed with cassis, raspberry and other juicy berry flavors, while the lushness of the wine rolls over your palate with ease. It's not easy to find Cabernet this good in the $20 range, so get after this one while it's under the radar.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Nothing is hidden in this bruising, forward Cab. The nose is oaky as can be, but also endowed with intense black fruit. The palate might register as soft to some, but there's still a tannic foundation that bolsters blackberry, spice cake and molasses flavors. Not super long on the finish but intense in a lumbering sort of way. Drink now–2011.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This is a delicious and somewhat rare style of Malbec: it has none of the usual oak. What you wind up with is fruity, clean and pure. The body is maybe a touch leaner without the oak; the flavor profile is brighter and more linear.",Malbec
Argentina,"Regal and ready, and showing equal amounts of early maturity along with youthful fruit and menthol aromas. The palate is saturated with raspberry and black cherry, while the lengthy finish offers coffee and chocolate. Drive and power are not in short supply, so take this one with fatty foods like ribs or steak.",Malbec
Argentina,"Not sure why a Mendoza Malbec is named Havana Rose, but that's not really important when you taste this ripe, candied wine that shows reasonable balance and character. The palate offers bright, candied raspberry and sweet plum flavors, and the finish is warm and full. About all you can ask for in a $9 wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big, fragrant, lightly oily and tropical, with zingy, lively acidity pushing lemon and green melon flavors. The finish is round, a little pithy and solid, and overall this strikes us being the quintessential quaffing white for the summer and early fall.",Torrontés
Argentina,"This new casual wine from Valentin Bianchi is solid with full berry aromas. The palate is round and a little soft and plump, with prune, fig and blackberry flavors. Sweet and easy throughout, with a mild finish. Nothing out of the ordinary.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"For Argentine PG it's attractive. The nose is clean but simple, while the palate is fresh and easy, with driving pineapple and lemon flavors being pushed along by good acidity. Juicy and wet on the finish, and overall it ranks as a nice, fruity wash.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"A balanced Malbec with red fruit aromas and just a touch of aged cheese on the nose. The palate is creamy and slightly candied, with layered black fruit, fig and chocolate flavors. Creamy and candied but lively on the finish, with enough integrity and structure to rank as a Best Buy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Granular, raisiny and heavy on the nose, with jammy blackberry aromas. The palate then hits with a thud; it's chunky and low in acidity, which yields a thick flavor set of prune and coffee. Better once it breathes, but it's still a bit too sticky and syrupy for our liking.",Malbec
Argentina,"Balsam wood, pencil eraser, coconut, anise and blackberry aromas share the bouquet. It feels linear and a touch scratchy, with roasted berry and toasted flavors that steer toward bacon. It feels a little gritty and short on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Deep, lush, balanced and oaky, with bacon, floral notes and huge raspberry and cassis aromas. Layered and structured across the palate, with concentration and balance to go with lusty cassis, blackberry, mocha and spice flavors. Finishes toasty and dark, with waves of espresso and mocha. Now–2015.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Rich, warm and possessing a ton of dry oak, this is one serious Argentine Cabernet. The palate is grippy as a rubber glove, with snappy berry flavors and pointed acidity. It's ripe, racy and edgy, with substance to the fruit, feel and finish. Drink now through 2010.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Here's another success from Bodega Norton. The nose is rich and big, with crusty chocolate and coconut aromas. More chocolate blends with blackberry and pepper in the mouth, while on the finish there's sexy layered darkness. It's New World pomp and pleasantness in all its glory.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This wine needs time to get its legs underneath it. It comes on young and rugged and gamy, but if you let it sit and air out for 20 minutes it turns deeper, riper and much more fruity. And by the time it settles you're smack dab in the middle of mountain berry and other natural flavors. Will get better with some bottle time.",Malbec
Argentina,"Starts with roasted, heavy aromas of rubber, prune, shoe polish and toasted wood. The palate shows pretty good texture along with flavors of blackberry, herbs and prune. Solid but basic, with minimal complexity and depth.",Merlot
Argentina,"A little stewy on the nose, with vanilla, liqueur and roasted berry aromas. The palate is young and vibrant, arguably teetering on sharp, with piercing cherry flavors and lots of oak. Flavorful but rough, with burnt brown sugar on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Round, dark and slightly baked on the nose, with quasi-syrupy and creamy berry flavors that have plenty of the label's “oak cask” character. The finish is endowed with mocha and toast, and overall it's your textbook, good, regular Malbec from Argentina.",Malbec
Argentina,"Earthy up front, with a heavy, mildly herbal set of berry aromas. The palate is juicy and fairly solid, with fresh red-berry flavors accented by a dose of creamy vanilla. Long on the finish for basic Merlot, with an herbal lasting impression.",Merlot
Argentina,"Rustic yet complete, with dark, sweet aromas of toasted coconut, mint and berry syrup. The palate is juicy and balanced, and that's really the key in distinguishing the top Bonardas from the more frequently found hard and scouring ones. In our book, Broquel is a Bonarda you can count on.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Robust, deep and candied on the nose, with rooty richness, medicinal notes and complexity. The palate is smooth, meaty, healthy and suave, with lush black fruit, prune and earthy flavors. Long, likable and showing a lot of depth and structure. Drink now through 2014.",Malbec
Argentina,"Full, dense and dark, with powerful berry aromas and hints of rubber and leather on the bouquet. The palate breathes complexity and style but also raw power, and the flavors of blackberry, fig paste and herbs are just lusty and rich enough to register as modern Mendoza. Classy and deep; best from 2011–2015. A Malbec-Cabernet-Petit Verdot blend.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"If you don't mind a little overt wood on your Malbec, then this will certainly do the trick and more. The nose offers some maple and mature berry aromas, while the palate pumps oak-infused black cherry fruit. Lengthy on the finish, with mocha and vanilla. Like we said, it's a bit toasty and woody, but overall it works like a charm.",Malbec
Argentina,"Few Argentinean wineries are doing everyday red wines better than Chakana. A case in point is this excellent, superbly balanced, easy-drinking Cab. The nose is meaty, earthy and magnetic, while the palate is ripe, harmonious and full of cassis and raspberry. It's fruity more than complex, with stature and style.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Color, power, flavor and commendable balance; that's pretty much the format for Punto Final, one of Argentina's go-to brands for Malbec. This youngster is ripe and ready, and it holds form onto a long finish. If it seems a little young and clumsy upon pouring, air it out and it'll improve.",Malbec
Argentina,"Deep purple in color and rich on the nose, with bacon, roasted berry, rubber, spice and heft. The palate is thick and round, with smooth edges and flavors of bacon grease and roasted black fruits. Sweet and spicy late, with a lasting flavor of savory barbecue. Hard to peg as Cabernet Sauvignon but not a bad wine if you like yours lusty and rich.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Floral and tropical aromas are a direct reflection of the 75% Torrontés in the blend. There's also lychee, another Torrontés byproduct. Otherwise, it's lean and tangy, with tangerine, lychee and green melon flavors. The more it opens the more it smells like a kitchen cleanser. But the forwardness and snap are admirable. Contains 15% Viognier and 10% Chardonnay.",White Blend
Argentina,"Big, roasted and full, with slightly earthy, burnt aromas to go with standard berry fruit. The palate is solid in feel, with herbal berry and tea flavors along with zesty acidity. Finishes toasty and a little herbal, with any leftover fruit heading quickly to the shadows.",Malbec
Argentina,"A hulk of a wine with forced oak that results in aromas of mint, char, citrus peel and smoke. The palate is endowed with ample black cherry, raspberry and mocha flavors, while the finish mixes orange peel, chocolate and a lot of leftover wood resin. Interesting but very oaked up and not quite in perfect balance.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Despite tough vintage conditions, Bodega Septima got this blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Tannat right. The nose is dark, solid and full of attractive black fruit and coconut aromas. Lush and a mile deep on the palate, with sultry, smoky, dark flavors of blackberry, licorice and spice. A chewy, rich and balanced wine; drink now through 2014.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Bella Vista is the richest, most dense of A-F's three single-vineyard Malbecs. It opens with leather, smoke, blueberry and floral aromas. Next in line is a chewy, dark palate of wild berry and earthy fruit flavors. Clean on the finish with a bit less acidity than its brothers, Altamira and Mirador. Drink now through 2015.",Malbec
Argentina,"Even if this full-bodied Cab starts with some eggy, pastry-like aromas, it soon finds its form. The nose brings char and baked black fruit, while the palate is full of creamy blackberry and brown sugar flavors. Rather rich and ripe, with medium tannins and mild acidity. Drink sooner than later.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Mauricio Lorca makes wine for Enrique Foster but his private label is something to keep an eye on. Poetico is potent and fairly pure; and it contains 10% Cabernet and 5% Syrah in addition to 85% Malbec. The palate delivers hearty blackberry, plum and vanilla flavors, while the finish is sturdy as a statue, with length and firm tannins.",Malbec
Argentina,"This straightforward apple and toast-dominated Chardonnay has medium weight and decent length. It's decidedly mainstream, a bit too one-dimensionally so. But it's still tasty in that mode, and oak-lovers will savor the spicy wood that comes up very strongly on the close. Again, good, but here a more reserved use of oak might yield a wine of more nuance and better balance.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"This tangy and light-to-medium weight wine offers bright red fruit with slightly darker berry, chocolate and earth shadings. Good acidity keeps it lively on the palate, as does the tannic tang of the moderately long finish. Just what a value Merlot should be.",Merlot
Argentina,"Flavorful, but very brisk, with moderate-to-high acidity. It's a modest wine, with blackberry and coffee aromas and flavors, slight tobacco accents and a short finish. It's good, but not as satisfying an overall package as the other reds at the same level of the range.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dark and chewy, with cassis, blackberry and a slight hint of green to the nose. A solid red made for early consumption, this Cab has soft tannins, lots of oak-based vanilla and an easygoing personality.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Aggressive and a tad bit rough, but it's still young. Time should soften it up, and what will then be waiting is a ton of rugged black fruit, some creamy oak, and a whole lot of vanilla and carob. Made for the masses; loaded with power.",Malbec
Argentina,"Earthy yet fresh, with red fruit aromas that flow directly onto the sweet, oozing palate. Quite simple, but ready to drink. It's got chocolate and fruit syrup on the finish along with integrated tannins and acidity. Textbook fashion.",Malbec
Argentina,"In the past this was a Bordeaux blend but now it's all or almost all Malbec. And because it hails from cooler Tupungato it features floral aromas more than heavy berry scents, and in the mouth it's all about red fruit as opposed to beefy black fruit. If it's a bit short on the finish, chalk that up to its racier, more streamlined frame.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pure, jammy and heady: voilà, it's modern Malbec. The palate here is inviting, with decadent plum and blackberry flavors working in tandem. The finish is plush at first, with chocolate and espresso notes coming later. With plenty of virtues, this is a very nice wine from an average vintage.",Malbec
Argentina,"Oaky, creamy and a bit lactic on the nose, with an easy style to the palate and ripe, sweet flavors of blackberry and black cherry that are delicious but lack complexity. Finishes big, syrupy and sweet, with a spot of raisin. Really good for a blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Petit Verdot. Drink now through 2013.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Big, dark, sweet and jammy on the nose, with earthy, candied, sweet aromas of ripe blackberry and herbs. The palate delivers bouncy, showy acidity, while the flavors of black cherry, dark plum and chocolate are solid and rewarding. A little pruney on deeper inspection, with a leathery quality to the wine's depth. Drink now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fast becoming one of Argentina's most reliable value brands, Altosur got it right in 2006 with its basic Malbec. The wine is full, chewy, healthy and bright. It has all the attributes of good, young Malbec: plums, berries and chocolate, with lushness and some style.",Malbec
Argentina,"Starts out sort of soft and shy, with modest red-fruit aromas. In the mouth, raspberry and cherry flavors get a quick lift from grabby, firm tannins. And by the time this baby hits its groove you're onto a finish defined by a starchy feel and long-lasting Cabernet essence. Airing is this wine's best friend; decant or drink over time.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"The bouquet is fairly tight, with aromas of coffee, crushed minerals, crude oil and fine herbs. The palate runs snappier than most high-end Malbecs, but it also delivers on the promise of ripeness and black-fruit flavors. Finishes in healthy fashion, with some slickness and speed. Very nice and likely even better with food. 1,000 cases made. Imported by Slocum & Sons.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lemon, cream and toasty aromas are backed by flavors of melon, pineapple and banana. A typical but simple New World Chard: meaning it's a blend of sweet fruit, light oak and modest acidity.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Heavily coated with coconut and oiled leather aromas, however, the palate recedes to Bonarda's typical angularity. The flavors of blackberry and cherry are solid, but the mouthfeel runs rough and sheer. And it finishes with some saltiness and leather. A good wine, not without its fault.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Wines like this have defined and propelled Malbec mania. It's ripe, bold and firm, with welcoming berry aromas and a powerful but healthy palate of ripped black cherry, berry and cola flavors. In the mix and on the finish you'll find coffee and mocha. Drink now and over the next two years.",Malbec
Argentina,"Very clean, smooth and inviting. Every piece is in place, and the wine flows from nose to palate to finish with ease and comfort. Flavors of black cherry, cassis and blackberry are creamy and deep, with a hint of vanilla sweetness and oak. Warm and chewy as well. Cabernet Sauvignon with 12% Cab Franc; drink now.",Cabernet Blend
Argentina,"Here's a nice wine that pushes the right buttons while not raising any red flags. Raspberry and vanilla flavors are solid and pleasing, while the medium-weight palate features depth and balance. This is not the richest, most overpowering Malbec you'll find, but it comes from 75-year-old vines and its virtues far outdistance its faults.",Malbec
Argentina,"Quite earthy and ripe, as tree bark, leather and prune make up the bouquet. The mouth is lively and snappy, with red fruit taking over and holding reign. Sheer, zesty and juicy describes the mouthfeel, while overall the wine delivers depth and integrity. Not overly complex but very good and straightforward.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This vintage seems more medicinal and overtly ripe than the more balanced 2003. It has high alcohol (15.2%) and medium acidity, thus it's a touch gummy and syrupy. But if you like power at the core of your Cabernet-Merlot blends and you don't mind a little fire in the hole after drinking, then we recommend this chewy, ripe, very modern offering.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
Argentina,"Bold and packed to the gills with black fruit, well-applied oak and rubbery, fresh tannins. As Bonarda goes, this is a clear winner; it's blowsy and ribald on the nose, with tons of black fruit, coconut and mocha. The palate is firm but not overly hard, with fig, black plum and length to the finish. Drink now through 2012.",Bonarda
Argentina,"A bit rusty in color and mature, but that's what makes this wine different than most. It's earthy, a bit leathery and muddled, and slightly baked. But it's also subdued, mellow and sturdy, with lighter tannins and hints of herbs to go with finely roasted berry and tomato flavors. Integrated, long and spicy late. Drink now through 2012.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Good wine, especially if you like some new oak that brings a lot of cream, vanilla and chocolate to the game. Along the way there's plenty of boysenberry, blueberry and other sweet dark-fruit flavors. A winner that should meet the expectations of many.",Malbec
Argentina,"Robust and with a touch of raisin, this full-bodied Cab hits many correct notes. The oak may be a bit buttery and the tannins fairly full, but overall this does a good job of impersonating a much pricier wine; it's big, liberally oaked, ripe and quite good as a whole.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Overt oak is the first thing you encounter on the nose, but underneath the heavy wood covering is a polished and sincere wine. The mouth is lively and juicy, with commendable plum and raspberry flavors. And while the finish is sort of basic in its vanilla and chocolate character, it has a nice feel to it. A wine with virtues but maybe a touch too much new oak.",Malbec
Argentina,"Full and inviting up front, with hickory and leather in addition to dark-fruit aromas. This is a collaboration between two Italian buddies and the wine features black cherry and plum flavors but also rather grabby, heavy tannins. It's ultimately chewy and a bit hard, but still it's eminently satisfying.",Malbec
Argentina,"Still not sure what the difference is between Sur de los Andes and Alma de los Andes (they're from the same winery), but this wine seems a tiny bit more open and friendly than the Alma. It's evolved, sweet and full of blackberry and blueberry flavors. And the finish carries some warm baked notes that anchor the deal.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Getting past the giant blast of oak that dominates the bouquet is not an easy task, but the intrepid wood chopper will find another side to this wine, one that's full of bright, juicy black fruit and syrupy core sweetness. Of course, the oak is always present and with that comes mocha, coffee and vanilla notes. Imported by Gascon USA.",Malbec
Argentina,"This wine seems mulchy and warm; it comes out of the bottle with attitude and some fire. As it settles, you get berry, bramble and leather, and always does it seem a little “traditional” in style rather than modern and polished up. Definitely a full-bodied, oily wine that could use more flavor and fruit.",Malbec
Argentina,"Here's a Bordeaux-style blend to snap up if you're lucky enough to find it. It's a definite re-issue in that it was first released at $25 in 2006 but was put back on the market last year at $15. And what a bargain it is: Earth, tar and tobacco vie with dried cherry and raspberry on the nose and palate; the finish is long, elegant and dry. A mature, classy wine to drink now.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Plenty of mocha and vanilla combined with racy berry aromas give this an ice cream sundae-type of bouquet. The palate is healthy and snappy, with lively acidity pushing black cherry and meaty plum flavors. Whole and toasty on the finish, with touches of excellence throughout. Impressive for a first effort, with room to improve. Drink now through 2012.",Malbec
Argentina,"Almost everything about this wine is right on the money, from bouquet and flavors to feel and price. The nose is sweet and floral, with deep, alluring berry aromas. The palate offers a fine texture, with pure, layered blackberry, cola and spice flavors. Satisfying on the finish and complete.",Malbec
Argentina,"Santa Julia doesn't try to trick you with its wines. They are what they are, and for under  10 this creamy, berry-packed wine should please the masses. The fruit is plump and ripe, while the mouthfeel is round and healthy. A great model for quality, affordable Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Graffigna has shown improvement with its current set of releases. This Cab starts out dark, charred and full of blackberry aromas and flavors. It initially seems flashy and ready for anything. But the more you run it across your palate, the more the acidity rises up. And before long it almost seems scouring and jumpy. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dark and heavily oaked on first blush, but give it time to unwind or let it sit in the bottle for a year or two and this will satisfy any Malbec lover. Early on, it's dense and full of shoe polish, mint and coconut; later it spreads out to show sweet dark-berry flavors and finally a rich, almost sticky finish of woodspice, brown sugar and lushness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sauvignon Blanc is far from being Argentina's signature grape, so the fact that this one from San Juan province is legitimate, crisp and varietally correct is impressive. Beyond that, the wine delivers true lime, passion fruit and citrus aromas and flavors. Fresh and easy to like.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"If you've never tried Argentine Bonarda, Chakana is a good place to start. The nose offers the varietal's typical vulcanized rubber and dark-fruit aromas, while the palate is smooth and full of straightforward blackberry. Complicated it's not, but it is pleasant.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Dark to the eye and nose, with aromas of rubber, black fruit and lots of sharp-edged oak. Wood more than fruit controls the front of the palate and the finish, but inbetween the folds you'll find plump berry and black pepper flavors. A nice Malbec but arguably a little heavy on the oak.",Malbec
Argentina,"This reserve-level Chardonnay isn't that expensive yet it shows considerably more balance and complexity than the winery's regular Chard. This version offers peach and other stone-fruit aromas, while the palate presents smooth white fruit and toast flavors. Fairly long, with a healthy feel throughout.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Sweet and frothy, and made quite close to the Moscato style, meaning the nose is full of flowers and lime. The palate is a mix of crushed children's vitamins, mango and ripe melon.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Not nearly as intense and Cab-like as the 2003. For whatever reason, this vintage is bouncy and light, with a touch of smoked meat and rubber but mostly simple raspberry and cherry flavors. The feel borders on jammy, and it finishes with a touch of chocolate but also kind of herbal.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Despite some warm earth and compost on the nose, this shows positives such as solid cherry, plum and blackberry flavors. It opens on the midpalate but then thins out rather drastically on the finish. Like most in its class, it's hard Bonarda; but it has its merits, too.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Woody and smelling of sawdust early, this four-grape blend eases toward roasted berry, cassis, herbal plum and molten chocolate. It's massive and structured, with a big-boned skeleton and heat on the leathery, roasted finish due to 15.5% alcohol. Big, fiery, saucy and lusty, but short on refinement and elegance.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Round, dense and correct on the nose, with heft and dark fruit aromas. The palate is tight, pure and just the right size, with blackberry, boysenberry and a bit of vanilla and caramel in the background. Smooth on the tail end, with sweet coconut and mocha notes. Friendly and well done for the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"A rich and creamy sort of Malbec that pours on the weight, extract and oaky, coconutty character. The palate is syrupy, with huge flavors of roasted berry, molasses and sweet spices. Arguably on the baked and heavy side, but definitely a rich, huge wine with just enough core acidity to keep it balanced.",Malbec
Argentina,"As always, this late-harvest white delivers peach and lychee aromas, and it's even better in the mouth, where intense lychee and pineapple flavors rise up and steal the show.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Like most of Alma's wines, this Bonarda is smooth, fruity and approachable. The nose is simple and offers some spice, licorice and herb notes, while the berry flavors are just as they should be: easy and jammy. There's nothing challenging about this red; just pour it with pizza or burgers and enjoy.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Punchbowl melon and tropical fruit aromas are the lead act. Next up is a zesty palate of green apple, melon and citrus. The body is a bit plump and round, while the finish shows orange peel and lime zest. Good for Mendoza Sauv Blanc.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Warm earth and other dark, leathery aromas dominate. In the mouth, there's black cherry and raspberry flavors supported by scratchy tannins. Despite some grab and clumsiness, this is a good Cabernet with ripeness and a forward personality.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Black as night, with aromas of leather, wild berries and wet dog. It is salty and oaky in the mouth, with vanilla and tannin but not a whole lot of ripe, lovable dark fruit. Gets better as it evolves, but where's the dark, sweet fruit to match the oak, tannins and tightness?",Bonarda
Argentina,"Quite piercing and fiery at first, which announces that it is fully oaked. Along the way there's savory notes, saucy leather and flashes of dark fruit. This would be a better wine with more fruit and flesh, and less barrel. The dill, vanilla and spice flavors are a bit too dominant.",Malbec
Argentina,"Like a good Bonarda should be, this is sweet, lush, dense and jammy on the nose. The palate brings big tannins and a slight rubbery mouthfeel, but the flavors of black cherry and wild berry are big, tasty and untamed. Full of power; needs airing upon opening but aging isn't necessary. Includes 20% Malbec and 10% Cab Franc.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Dark as night, with shoe polish, coconut and powerful black-fruit aromas. This is jammy, dense, soft and not for aging, but it does deliver a truck load of toasted coffee, blackberry, molasses and crisped brown sugar. Supersweet, rich and made to drink now.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Starts out all rowdy and sweaty, with animal hide and warm earth. And that all makes sense: this is unoaked, unmolested Syrah and thus it has its funky side. Along the roadside there's blackberry and pepper flavors and peppy acids and tannins. An interesting ride that's not without its ups and downs.",Syrah
Argentina,"We've been watching this wine for several years and it doesn't seem to be on the upswing. This vintage is good as Cabernet goes, but it comes across a little racy and jumpy. The mouthfeel runs tight and the tannins are spunky and on the border of being rough. Maybe another year will settle it down.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Chunky, big and forward, with some fiery horseradish and spent campfire on the nose. Blackberry, wild raspberry and leather work the demanding, starchy palate, and the finish is short and generally clean and healthy.",Malbec
Argentina,"After a rubbery opening, this blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Bonarda picks up steam and freshens up significantly. Aromas of sly dried berry take over, leading to a full, flush palate of plum, raspberry and raisin. Comes around the more time you spend with it.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Very nice Malbec for the money. The bouquet is floral and bright, with a hint of dry oak and mocha. The feel is full and well balanced, while the palate has a bright and lively personality with cherry, raspberry, chocolate and spice flavors. Smooth, tastes good and offers plenty of value.",Malbec
Argentina,"A dark and toasty specimen with a deep-purple tint and aromas of oak, butter and powerful blackberry fruit. The palate is textured and rich, with thick, smoky flavors of black fruits and peppery spice. Pours on the oak but in an integrated way; very good for varietal Cab from 2008.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dark, sweet and rooty on the nose, with a warm, soft outlook. The palate is bold and thorough, with ripe berry, plum and chocolate flavors. Per usual, Punto Final is ripe, sweet and big, with a peppery finish and toasty, jammy warmth.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lively but also narrow on the nose. The feel is very fresh and juicy due to firm, bracing acidity that gives a tangy, lemony character to the wine's dark-fruit core. Snappy, linear and crisp for a wine of magnitude and extraction. Some might say it's sheering and acidic; others might call it ageworthy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark and raisiny, and pushing the ripeness meter to the max. This is a dense, sweet, semihot wine with raisin, stewed berry and jammy black cherry flavors. It's big and broad, more simple than complex, with a raisiny DNA and a boatload of sweetness. Personally, I prefer Cassone's less expensive, more balanced reserva to this wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Simple red-fruit aromas, sweetness and balance come right away on the bouquet, and the palate is basically the same thing: pleasant strawberry and raspberry flavors and a good feel. Nothing fancy but smooth and fun to drink. Commendable given that production is 50,000 cases.",Malbec
Argentina,"Leather, mint and a touch of raisin make for a fairly ripe and mature bouquet. The palate follows with reasonably vibrant berry flavors and a little chocolaty heft. If it falls a bit flat on the tail that only means that it's not for aging and is meant to drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"Spunky and funky on the nose, with some heat and bramble. There's definitely a gamy side to this wine, but as it airs it picks up more of Malbec's trademark feel and fruit. Not as forward and clean as it should be; but has its benefits. Imported by Southern Wine Group.",Malbec
Argentina,"Black fruit and a hint of tire rubber work the nose, and that's backed up by raspberry and sweet vanilla flavors. This wine is pretty good overall, with depth and push, but it's also a bit starchy and slightly green at its core.",Malbec
Argentina,"Olive, blackberry and toasty oak all give hope, but when this wine crosses the palate the acidity is so intense that it causes you to take count of your cheeks, tongue and teeth. On one hand, there's blackberry and cassis flavors to enjoy; on the other, the mouthfeel leaves you roughed up. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",Malbec
Argentina,"A tale of two wines. The early impression is that of a foxy, incomplete, sweaty wine with gaps in the fabric. But once it gets air, things turn around for the better. Ultimately it proves itself as a serious Malbec with a broad texture and jammy, sweet berry fruit. But it starts out so scattered and funky that it remains compromised.",Malbec
Argentina,"Earthy and rugged at first, then it smoothes out to show cola and lush berry aromas. Plump and round in the mouth, with jammy blackberry core flavors, a hint of herbs and spice, and then a chewy, sticky, generous finish. Very nice Malbec with a cool identity.",Malbec
Argentina,"For an average vintage this is an average wine. It has some bramble, leather and mild green notes to the nose, which are backed by red-fruit and brambly flavors. The feel is fresh and racy due to firm acids. Not the most expressive wine going, but nobody is going to call it flat or flabby.",Malbec
Argentina,"Young and sturdy, with pear and apple aromas enveloped in popcorn and wood. The palate offers standard New World weight and sweetness along with flavors of pear, vanilla and oak. More on the full-bodied, oaky side, but generally it's balanced and approachable.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A little damp and heavy, with molasses, stewed berry and char on the nose. The palate, however, is fairly jumpy and alert; fiery berry flavors hit with force and some heat. On the finish you'll find berry essence and some bramble. Is it slightly green at its core? We think so. Imported by Southern Wine Group.",Malbec
Argentina,"Simple but nice in its class. The nose offers bulky but clean fruit and a touch of saddle, while the palate is ample, fruity and round. It flairs out on the finish but keeps rolling in the right direction. Good for the price.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Getting pricey as Argentine Chard goes, this moderately rich wine has true aromas and flavors, meaning there's some apple, pear and butter to sniff and vanilla-tinged peach and melon to taste. Not as complex or complicated as maybe it should be, but easy to like.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Concentrated and intense, but typical of Bonarda this is a fierce wine with a rock-hard mouthfeel and slightly tart, limited raspberry flavors. Not exactly sour but it makes your mouth seize up and take notice.",Bonarda
Argentina,"We haven't seen much improvement in this wine since the 2003 vintage. It's still lacking forward, ripe fruit and instead shows more leather and drying, firm tannins. Shows glimpses of higher quality but can't support them.",Malbec
Argentina,"Popcorn, green-apple and scallion aromas precede crisp, tart flavors of barely ripe peach and grapefruit. The finish is short and citrusy, boosted by choppy acids. Racy but not rich.",Champagne Blend
Argentina,"Malbec seems like the best bet for this organic label, which has shown some shaky wines alongside this. Even this one has a mild lactic, pasty streak to the nose along with raspberry and peppery spice. Lacks the cuddle and depth of the better Argentine Malbecs.",Malbec
Argentina,"Short on berries and jam and heavily oaked, thus fruit plays second fiddle to oak spice, spearmint and hard cinnamon on the nose. The palate is on the brambly side, while the finish is fairly long and a bit leathery. Has body and size but lacks the fine points.",Malbec
Argentina,"The wood is a bit forced, and overall this wine has a heavy, full-fruited personality. But the depth and ripeness are pretty nice and the blackberry, dark plum and cassis flavors are earnest. A bit tannic and not all that varietal.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Honeysuckle and other sweet aromas greet you. In back of that there are flavors of pineapple, mango and apple. This runs crisp and tangy with more lemon-drop character than butter or vanilla.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Sweet and reduced aromas of red licorice and prune lead to sketchy red cherry flavors and not much body. The wine is closed, hard and chewy, but with a lot of fruit-forward potency.",Malbec
Argentina,"Herbal aromas infiltrate the nose, and the palate features midlevel red fruit with a strong herbal edge. The finish shows saline, chocolate and pepper, and never does it rise much above struggling.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Burnt popcorn and some ammonia make the nose fairly harsh. Time softens it a bit as it yields to green-fruit flavors. Finishes dry as a soda cracker, with some Old World touches. Not an easy wine to enjoy; it's very lean and underdeveloped.",Sparkling Blend
Argentina,"Big and spicy at first, and then vegetal, lesser characteristics seep in and take over. The palate has baked black fruit and a finish of bitter chocolate and pepper, but also some rooty, bark-like issues. There's no point of focus to this wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"A well-made everyday Malbec that gets it done in all ways. Smells nice and floral, with bold, smooth berry aromas. The palate is fresh and lively, with juicy berry flavors, controlled creamy oak notes and spice. Clean on the finish, and a pleasure to drink.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with candied, chocolaty aromas that contradict its age. In the mouth, it's mature although the structure is breaking up; nonetheless, it's interesting and attractive, with herb, raspberry, tea, tobacco and chocolate flavors. Overall it's a different breed, and despite having lost its structure it's sly and well worth a go. Drink now.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A nice, clean, fairly complex white is what this is. The nose is all lychee and jasmine, and it's not at all heavy or oily. The palate is bouncy and fresh, with a tropical mix of lychee, melon and papaya flavors. Agile on the finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Graham cracker is the lead aroma, and that's followed by jammy fruit, cookie dough and finally a touch of raisin. The palate is plump for an '08, with berry flavors, herbal notes and some bitterness. A touch clipped and rough, but a good effort for a tough year.",Malbec
Argentina,"Soft, lightly fragrant and peachy, with a hint of talcum powder to the nose. The palate offers your basic mix of melon and lychee, while the feel is good and there's a persistent finish. Straightforward stuff.",Torrontés
Argentina,The nose kicks off with ripe apple and zest and draws you in. The palate is live-wire pineapple and green apple with plenty of tang and a worthy mouthfeel. Even on the finish it holds the line.,Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Sweet pear and powdered sugar carry the confected nose, while the palate is also on the sweet side, with sugared citrus and banana flavors. Feelwise, there's adequate acidity to keep it wet and juicy, while the finish is candied but not what you'd call sticky. Imported by Quintessential Family of Wines, LLC.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Oaky up front, with more than a dash of mocha, caramel and sweet berry fruit aromas. The palate is zesty and honest, with juicy, bright black cherry and berry flavors. Finishes toasty and perky, with one last shot of firm acidity to keep it running long and late.",Malbec
Argentina,"For an affordable Argentine Chardonnay, this is not a bad effort. But it is a little oily and loaded down with movie popcorn and buttery aromas. Medium in depth, with candied flavors and a peppery bitterness to the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A little charred and bulky, but pretty good for a basic New World Cabernet. The nose is a mix of ripe fruit, licorice and herbs, while the palate is tame and veers to strawberry. Simple and a touch herbal.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Good but sort of generic. The nose exudes strawberry and milk chocolate, and the palate features blueberry fruit and some citrus-like acidity. The mouthfeel is a bit raw and tangy, but overall it is clean and presents itself well.",Syrah
Argentina,"Fading fast; this plump, hot-climate Chard is pretty much as expected: there's lots of oak covering peach, butterscotch and apple cider aromas and flavors. Borderline cloying.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Fairly sweet on the nose, with plum and a touch of spice. Things get more rugged in the mouth, where cherry and blackberry flavors carry a medicinal edge. A big Syrah but also a clumsy, heavy-handed one. Proceed with caution.",Syrah
Argentina,"Some dry oak and smoke frames simple earth and berry aromas, but the mouth is condensed and flat. There isn't much bounce to this overripe red; it's heavy and seems to have caught a lot of sun in the vineyard.",Malbec
Argentina,"Novus' basic Cab is probably a better wine for the money. This one seems to want to justify its reserve status by offering more oak. But that oak carries that creamy vanilla and carob flavor, making the wine sticky. And maybe the raw material is a bit overripe as well.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Intense on the nose and colorful, but in the end this wine shows little character, complexity or style. It's all about color and extract but you don't get much richness, charm or ripeness. And it's almost sassy and tangy on the palate and finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Not sure exactly what's happening at Bianchi in San Rafael. A few years back Bianchi's wines were almost all exemplary but lately they've been all over the map. This overoaked, charred Cabernet is a perfect example of a wine without a cause. It's burnt, herbal and while it has mouthfeel, nothing seems to be working in tandem.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Round, lifted and bright, with full berry, cassis and plum aromas. The palate is round and the body full, while the flavor profile includes roasted blackberry, coffee, chocolate and coconut. A full and chewy wine that comes across nice given the troubles of the '08 vintage.",Malbec
Argentina,"A pretty white wine with lively aromas, flavors and feel. The bouquet issues attractive lychee, melon and vanilla cream aromas, while the palate flows forth with apple, melon and exotic citrus flavors. Just spicy enough on the tail end, with a lasting taste of lychee fruit. Delicate, solid and fresh.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Blackberry, rubber and a suggestion of minerality work well as an invitation to this juicy, woody wine that's long and full in the mouth, with dark-fruit flavors of black cherry, blackberry and plum. Woody and toasty, too, but dry and spicy rather than sweet, blowsy and creamy. A nice Malbec for all occasions.",Malbec
Argentina,"Minty, oaky and spicy up front, with cherry and berry aromas that are potent. The palate is lush, flush and tannic, with aggressive flavors of bacon, smoke, roasted blackberry and savory spices. It finishes well, with freshness along with a dark, smoky tail.",Syrah
Argentina,"Light and spicy, with snappy, lean flavors of cherry and cranberry. This is more tart and underwhelming than most Malbec fans probably want, but it's not bad if you crave a lip-smacking red with zest.",Malbec
Argentina,"Jammy on the nose, with a touch of hard cheese backing that up. The mouth is jumpy and rustic, with raspberry and cherry skin flavors. Finishes lean, scouring and a bit hard.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Sort of soupy and stewy to begin with. The palate is stocky and forward, with short black plum and berry flavors. Quite ripe on the back end as it finishes chewy and soft. Organic.",Malbec
Argentina,"All in all this isn't a bad little wine for the price. It is a touch musky and heavy on the nose, but the palate holds form as it delivers round banana and melon flavors along with some vanilla and sponge cake on the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A bit heavy and bitter, but otherwise this is pretty decent. Not much can be said about the mild nose: it's typical but not that expressive. The palate, meanwhile, has a lot of weight and peach-pit bitterness, while the finish is a bit sluggish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Warm and oaky up front, with menthol. The palate is short and feels kind of flat as it offers up standard raspberry and other red-fruit flavors. Finishes with milk chocolate notes but overall it doesn't have much texture or personality.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,". Pencil eraser, tomato leaf and sweet fruit aromas are the appropriate set up to a candied palate that's sweet with cherry and strawberry essence. It's a wine with kick but it has also has chunky side.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Rather raisiny and herbal, with deep plum and blackberry flavors. It's a weighty wine with a finish that runs straight to prune and chocolate. A bit heavy and dull even at this everyday price point.",Malbec
Argentina,"Quite syrupy and stewy, with chunky fruit flavors and a lot of wayward heft. On the plus side there's coffee and bitter chocolate, but overall there's just not much elegance or lightness.",Malbec
Argentina,". The citrus and grapefruit aromas come across a little mealy and the wine never really rises above its candied citrus and apple cider qualities. It is pretty good on the tongue, however, and feels juicy. If chilled down it won't be a bad quaff.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"This wine requires breathing time to show its true colors. Early on it's reduced and cheesy, but soon it offers cleaner aromas of cola, berry and dark plum. The acidity is a bit high and sheering, but on the plus side it's fresh and driving, with bright cherry and berry flavors along with ample oak.",Malbec
Argentina,"Floral and fruity to open the show, and then there's plenty of oak and resin aromas coming next. The palate is tight, acid rich and woody, with solid black fruit flavors along with toasted oak notes and coconut. Juicy, fresh and healthy, but quite oaky.",Malbec
Argentina,"Starts out earthy and gaseous but the bouquet settles on round, full blackberry aromas. Lush, grabby and full in the mouth, with bold blackberry flavors that are clean, forward, uncomplicated and even a bit elegant. Tastes good and comes across smooth and polished for Bonarda.",Bonarda
Argentina,Spearmint and dry red fruit carry the nose. The palate shows basic sweet cherry and strawberry flavors but not much Cabernet character. All in all it's a stripped-back wine that offers rudimentary red-fruit character.,Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Wines can be big and loaded with everything, yet still be hard to enjoy. This is a case in point: It weighs in at 15% and brings searing aromas of tree bark, char and shoe polish. The palate is a saturated fusing of berry syrup, chocolate and alcohol. Almost Port-like in weight and style, but also very aggressive.",Syrah
Argentina,"A stewy Cabernet; the nose mixes cola with Fernet Branca and never does the wine approach anything we might label charming. It's linear and tight, with narrow flavors of cranberry and cherry. Short on texture and never shows much variation.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Vanilla and floral aromas have a suspicious artificiality to them, and in the mouth it's a sweet, sugary ride toward a cloying finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"The bouquet hits with reduced aromas of children's vitamin and pineapple, while the palate goes straight to hard cider and orange peel. It's a firm, acidic style that finishes citric and a touch bitter. Doesn't really smell or taste much like Chardonnay.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Granular and syrupy on the nose, and that same thickness of fruit is resurrected on the palate. Gritty on the finish, and sweet and lifeless as a whole.",Bonarda
Argentina,Nail polish on the nose along with clay will have you wondering. The palate on this organic wine is also a bit shaky; rubbery cherry and raspberry flavors are lean and the aftertaste is fiery. Too unusual and challenging.,Syrah
Argentina,"Ripe to overripe apple grips the nose, while the palate deals one-note citrus flavors. It's a flush, fat Chardonnay that's losing balance with each passing day. Finishes with an avalanche of orange character.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Light, airy, tropical and very nice for an under-$10 Argentine Chardonnay. The nose is nice and easy, while the flavors of orange, melon and lychee are tropical but seem right for the wine's body and acidity. Easygoing as they come, with a hint of sweetness on the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Initially it smells flat and earthy, with raisiny black fruit aromas. As it airs out it improves, but throughout its run it comes across heavy and wayward, with raisiny flavors and a simple dullness that prevents the wine from rising to the next level. Good Malbec but not a value at $45.",Malbec
Argentina,"By all accounts, 2008 was a tough vintage with cool weather, stunting frosts and ripeness issues. This wine seems afflicted: its opening is good, with coconut and floral shadings. But the palate is limited in richness and the flavors are standard, with char and barrel notes creating bitterness. Nice and honest for a subpar year.",Malbec
Argentina,"Having tasted the previous vintages and not liking them all that much, I can safely say that this 2010 is a much better, cleaner, more varietally correct version of Torrontés. It's clean, fresh and defined by light aromas and flavors of lime and green melon. Juicy and soda-like on the finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Sweet and savory aromas of hickory, BBQ and plum jam are nice, while the body is structured and full. The flavors follow the nose, meaning there's a savory, roasted quality to the wine but also jammy raspberry fruit notes. Chewy and a bit marinated, but it's quite good for the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sweet and candied on the nose, with marshmallow, cotton candy, chocolate-dipped cherry and dustiness. The palate has a pure feel and good ripeness, with flavors of herbal berry, toast, coffee and spice. Warm, chocolaty and oaky, with a lasting mocha flavor.",Malbec
Argentina,"Bold and pruney, with herbal, soft, ultraripe aromas in front of a jumpy yet partially stewed palate. This blend of Malbec with Bonarda and Syrah is your typical huge, tannic bruiser with big extract, huge tannins and just enough acidity to keep it pumping. Pretty good and perfectly drinkable, but a little over the edge.",Red Blend
Argentina,"As the higher-end 2008s hit the market, the vintage's underwhelming character is confirmed via wines like this. Oaky and rubbery on the nose, with scattered, lean berry fruit flavors and bitterness. Like many '08s, it's short on richness and comes across unfocused. That said, it's still a good wine that's not badly made.",Malbec
Argentina,"Given the difficulties of 2008, this is a commendable, drinkable wine. The nose is full and dark, with ripe berry aromas. That leads to a tannic, semisharp palate with spunky blackberry fruit that comes with spice and chocolate shadings. Flavorful and correct, but a little tight and tough.",Malbec
Argentina,"Clean and tropical, and not too heavy, oily or chunky. The nose is pure lemon, pear and apple, while the flavor profile revolves around citrus, apple and honey in the center. Finishes sweeter than it starts, but with dry papaya for balance. Good everyday Chardonnay from Argentina, something we don't see too often.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Earthy and warm on first take, with deep fruit and soupy side aromas. The palate is juicy and lively, with blackberry flavors as well as toasty accents. Round, ripe and generous on the finish, with brightness but also a syrupy side. All in all it's a good wine for the money.",Malbec
Argentina,"A touch creamy and showing fresh corn and haystack on the nose, but in the mouth it's plump, good and mild, with fleshy white fruit flavors sitting in front of a smooth, lightly pithy finish. Yes, it's another warm-climate tropical Chardonnay. But it's a good one that's easy to drink.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Concentrated, dark and clean for a basic 2008 Cabernet, with full but generic berry aromas and a pinch of rubber. The body is good and so is the structure, and overall the wine's roasted berry flavors blend well with sweet vanilla and caramel. Very good for value-priced Argentine CS.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Smoky, dark, rich and very oaky, with leather and cheese aromas. This is one concentrated, tannic bruiser; it's fully extracted and roasted, with blackberry, molasses, pepper and coffee flavors. A lush, round, jammy specimen that pours on richness in place of elegance and sophistication.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Warm and generous on the nose, with hints of brick dust and herbal strawberry fruit. Seems healthy and ready in the mouth, with good berry fruit, moderate spice notes and just a minor touch of herbal character. Works well, although it worked better when it was an under-$10 wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Minty and heavily oaked, with creamy aromas of vanilla bean, milk chocolate and raisiny sweetness. The palate smacks down with a tight, rubbery feel and then unleashes heavy, toasty flavors of herbal berry fruit, raw oak and mocha. Good for a rich, robust wine but it doesn't excel and it seems a little out of balance.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Opens with a slight chemical-smelling topping to berry, raisin and cheesy aromas. The palate is chunky on one hand and driving on the other, with berry and raisiny flavors. Lush on the finish but raisiny, and overall it settles on soft-bodied and flush.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big and purple, with ripe aromas of black fruits and bacon. The mouth is filling and full, with oaky blackberry, coffee and mildly roasted flavors. Turns more lush and soft on the finish, which is long and tastes of fig paste and prunes. Gets it done for the most part.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Pungent aromas of citrus range from lemon to orange, and there's also an oily element to the bouquet. The palate has a highly regular, almost lazy feel to it along with flavors of pithy citrus and nectarine pit. Finishes lemony and melony.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Opens with standard cherry/berry aromas, although with airing cheese notes and dill enter the picture. The palate is meaty in feel, with firm, tough, slightly roasted plum and berry flavors. Finishes hot, with a bold plum and berry character.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tropical and typical for the variety, with lychee and oily match stick on the nose. The palate is competent, with lemon-lime, apple and spiced Asian pear flavors. Dries out nicely on the finish; good Torrontés to drink as soon as possible.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Waxy and warm, with peach, sweet ham, spice and vanilla aromas. As Catena Alta goes, this is not stellar. In fact, it's light on fruit and lacks the depth of flavor and punch you'd hope to see from a $34 wine. What you get is a fleshy, soft Chard with mild peach, papaya and melon flavors, and then a whack of finishing oak.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Firm and leathery smelling, with a drying, oaky nose and then lifted, sweet flavors of jammy raspberry and cassis. The fruit here is riper than many '08 Cabs, and while it's a bit lean in feel, it tastes good and offers ample spice for balance.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Simple, well made and tropical, with a touch of oak. The palate is zesty, citric and healthy, with pineapple and orange flavors along with a pinch of star anise, vanillin and pith. Finishes fresh and juicy, with mild vanilla shadings.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Rubbery, tarry and quite black in nature, with a full-bodied mouthfeel and meaty, spicy dark-berry flavors. This ranks as a voluminous wine with a heavy disposition; it's sweet and spicy late, with generic bold-fruit character throughout.",Syrah
Argentina,"Modest, minerally and clean, with mild dusty apple aromas. The palate is pillowy and comfortable, with just enough acidity to push up the apple, green grape and white plum flavors. Finishes similarly, with a sweet lasting impression.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Slightly grassy and jammy on the nose, but otherwise you get basic cherry and raspberry aromas. The palate is medium bodied and a bit sharp in feel, with fresh, simple cherry and raspberry flavors. Tight and straightforward on the finish, with a hint of spice and chocolate.",Merlot
Argentina,"Aromas of dark berry are potent but narrow and limited, and there's a slight note of minty grass as well. The wine is juicy, bouncy and fresh in the mouth, with dark cherry and blackberry flavors. Simple, fruity and tasty, with good balance.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Seems light, stemmy and minty on first take, but airing reveals deeper cola and sweet fruit aromas. The palate is juicy, not too heavy and strides forward, while the flavors center on basic red fruits and berry syrup. A little raisiny late, but solid as a whole.",Malbec
Argentina,"Quiet yet solid on the nose, with mild aromas of cassis and black fruits. The palate is a bit sharp with acidity but overall the wine is well made and clean, with red berry, plum and other standard flavors. Defines goodness while not pushing the envelope at all.",Malbec
Argentina,"Earthy and rubbery, then more leafy and red, on the nose, with raspberry and plum fruit. The palate has a solid, ordinary feel and jammy flavors of baked berry. Standard finish with a fast fade.",Merlot
Argentina,"Simple and light, with orange blossom aromas. The palate is clean, zesty and citric, with apple, lime and lychee flavors. Chalky on the finish and cleansing. For casual sipping.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Scratchy on the nose, with raspberry and plum aromas. The palate has a generic, rubbery feel and sweet, standard cherry, cassis and plum flavors. Medicinal and rubbery on the finish, but will go well with basic foods like pizza, spaghetti or a burger.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"High Note is a dark, extracted type of Malbec with intense color, robust black fruit aromas and a rich, deep palate with core acidity and then monstrous, sweet berry flavors along the edges. It's hefty, fat and saturated, but also sweet and jammy. Delivers quantity and volume for the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"Quite woody for this weight class, with balsam shavings and berry aromas that are distant. Chewy, lactic and creamy across the tongue, with a flavor profile that brings chocolate and berry syrup flavors. Finishes with a final wave of oaky spice and bitterness; good but needs more fruit.",Malbec
Argentina,"Starts out rubbery and gaseous, but airing helps it along. The palate is regular in feel, with no glaring faults, while the flavors of berry fruits, oak and herbal shadings are easygoing. Finishes with toast, herbal notes and a mild baked sweetness.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"Generic and generally clean, with dry berry aromas and a touch of sharpness. The palate is full, stocky and solid, with black-fruit flavors and a medicinal character. Finishes dry, woody, peppery and slightly hot, with snap and power.",Malbec
Argentina,"A touch grassy to start, with blueberry and blackberry aromas. The palate has a clampy, tannic feel and snappy acids, while the flavors veer toward red berry, herbs, coffee and mocha. Tight and tannic on the finish, and overall it's short on body.",Malbec
Argentina,"Jammy raspberry aromas greet you, followed by dry spice, light oak and milk chocolate scents. The palate is warm, mildly rich and resiny, with oaky flavors of pepper, spice and black fruit. Finishes quite sweet but also peppery due to the oak treatment.",Malbec
Argentina,"Chunky on the nose, but also sort of rubbery, brambly, pickled and leathery. The palate is stretched and strained, with wiry acidity and piercing tannins supporting rubbery black fruit flavors. Grabby, tannic and a little hot on the finish. Good but on the sharp, underwhelming side.",Malbec
Argentina,"Chunky, earthy, malty and fruity all at the same time, but clacky and tough in the mouth, with big, grabby tannins supporting generic black fruit flavors. An aggressive, hard wine with sappy, jammy flavors; it delivers full kick and size.",Syrah
Argentina,"Bold and minty, with no shortage of tarry, rubbery black-fruit aromas. The palate is full, meaty, tough and tannic, with heat and candied, confected flavors that suggest chocolate-covered cherry and kirsch. Finishes sweet and candied, with average structure and stuffing.",Syrah
Argentina,"Opens with grassy notes along with cleaner, fruitier cherry and cassis aromas. The palate is medium bodied, with forward, jammy flavors of blackberry. Finishes flush but simple, with softness as opposed to a strong backbone of heavy tannins.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Rather jammy, murky and generic on the nose, with black-fruit aromas that center around plum and blackberry. The palate is edgy but fresh, with snappy, tarry black-fruit flavors. Feels rugged, rough and tannic but gets the job done in its price range.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Starts out mildly murky and leafy, with a leathery, dry nose. The palate is herbal, tight and juicy due to a high acid level, with red berry and peppery, mildly herbal flavors. A good, average wine with oak showing up on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Initially you get nothing but herbs, spice and tomato off this Bordeaux blend. The nose deals bell pepper, red pepper flake and tomato such that it smells more like chimichurri than wine. But with airing it improves to reveal dry strawberry, cherry and herbal spice flavors. More saucy, green and savory than fruity, and probably past its prime; but still it's offering some mature class and style.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Dark, rubbery aromas include black cherry, leather and cheesy notes. The palate is fairly high in acid, producing juiciness but also tartness and a lean, sinewy body housing snappy cherry, spice and herbal flavors. Good but prickly.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Aromas of buttercup, melon and lychee maintain their basic freshness but seem on the heavy side. The palate is similar; it's both chalky and heavy. Flavors of apple, melon and nectarine are solid but slightly bitter, and the finish is grabby and sticky.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Dark, rubbery aromas lead to a simple, sweet, baked, candied palate that also offers a touch of acidity and some balancing bitterness. The wine blends a fair amount of candied sweetness with a touch of butter, pepper and herbal notes. Standard fare as Malbec goes.",Malbec
Argentina,"Full but roasted and rubbery, with baked berry aromas leading to a thick, semistewed palate with dark berry and vanilla flavors. The palate is big but choppy, and the finish is also thick and tannic. Definitely round and meaty, but slips to the stewy side.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Slightly sharp and herbal upon first impression, with green herb and field-like aromas along with rubbery, earthy black fruit. The palate is mulled and a touch edgy, with herbal, lightly stemmy berry flavors. Decent as a whole, but sort of sharp, herbal and stemmy for a higher-end wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smells a bit heavy, oily and like dry cornflakes. The palate is  straightforward, with tropical, candied flavors of mango, banana and sweet melon. Sweetness is the key here; it's all over the palate and finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A Malbec-led blend that's off the grid by Argentine standards but which reflects the northern Salta region. The nose is earthy, herbal, roasted and tomatoey, while the palate is astringent and roasted, with herbal, spicy flavors of tomato, bell pepper and baked berries. Long and baked on the finish, with a slight fiery feel.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Murky and leathery on first take, with dry, earthy red fruit aromas emerging later on. The palate is fresh enough, with snappy acidity and tannic bite along with wan, mild fruit flavors and spice. Perfectly adequate but short on stuffing and depth.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lightly herbal and red in character, with tomato and raspberry aromas. The palate is snappy and emphasizes freshness, while the flavors are herbal and leafy, with plenty of red berry and cherry. Snappy and pointed, with a leafy overriding personality.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Good wine but a touch stemmy and burnt smelling. After the brushy, herbal aromas comes a juicy, crisp red fruit palate with raspberry and plum flavors but also a bit of green at the core. Finishes bold but a little hot and scratchy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Clean, timid and melony on the nose, with an emphasis on clean. Fresh and light in the mouth, and tasty despite being 100% uncomplicated. Flavors of sweet apple, pear and citrus are pleasant and should carry mass appeal. Good for an everyday white quaffer.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Neutral smelling other than a hint of peach and vanilla on the bouquet. Comes across a bit heavy and warm, but not too much so. Flavors of soft melon are appealing, and the finish is fleshy. Drink now before it loses its spunk.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Earthy and leathery smelling, but very much on the light-bodied side for Malbec. The palate is angular and slightly acidic, with juicy, spicy red-cherry flavors. Racy and lean on the finish, with a final wash of cleansing acids.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lean, mildly green aromas offer minimal fruit, and there's a salinic, swimming pool set of aromas as well. The palate is fairly thick and solid, with big tannins and flavors of candied fruits and carob that lean toward green. Shows big body and weight, but the nose is only fair while the flavors are herbal.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Tropical and blowsy on the nose. The palate is now chunky and heavy, while the flavors are mustardy and oily, with fruit notes that fall into the melon, peach and orange field. Flat and short on the finish, which indicates that it's already fading. Better to wait for the 2010.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Light and herbal on the nose, with a dilute set of raspberry and strawberry aromas. The palate has some creaminess but overall it tastes generic and baked, with syrupy sweetness at its core. An average wine with jammy qualities and focus issues.",Malbec
Argentina,"More leafy and mulchy than ideal, with coffee, herbal notes and a light green quality to the nose. The feel is starchy, and the flavors run burnt, mildly green and sweet, with a pasty, sticky finish. Has some merit but also falls a little short.",Malbec
Argentina,"Light and airy, with orange blossom and powdered sugar aromas. The palate is round and offers enough crisp acidity to keep the wine's lychee and lemon-lime flavors moving in the right direction. Reasonably good for ten bucks.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Dark purple in color, with a simple, candied, somewhat strained nose. The palate feels sharp while the acidity-tannin combo creates a narrowing mouthfeel. Flavors are roasted, herbal and lemony, while the finish is jumpy and edgy.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A little stinky and oily, which is often the downfall of the variety. The palate has a viscous grab to it and the flavors are rather generic and rudimentary, i.e. simple apple and melon with a mild chemical burn. Seems only semifresh at a young age.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Smells foxy and broken up, with a slight stemminess. The palate is tannic and drawing, with generic black fruit flavors that are candied with brown sugar and molasses. Sweet, rough, tough and like 1,000 others. Will do best with food, which should absorb some of the tannic shock.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A bit gaseous on the nose, with cidery apple aromas. The palate is waxy, oily and heavy, with chunky melon and papaya flavors. Meaty and full-bodied for a value-priced Chard, but also heavy and struggling for balance.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Rubbery and muddled at first, then more clarity arises with airing. The palate is firm, rather lean and acidic, with angular berry and cassis flavors. Finishes on the sharp side, with snappy, pointed acidity and crispness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Mildly tropical on the nose, but for the most part the bouquet lacks punch. The palate has friction and an oily feel, while the flavors are generic as they suggest apple and lime. Chalky and kind of bland on the finish; seems to be fading.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Earthy aromas mix with high-toned red fruit scents, while the palate is narrow and linear, with mildly green, saucy flavors that crowd out mild red fruit notes that fight to enter the picture. Herbal on the finish, but not offensive or difficult to drink.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A blend of Riesling, Albariño and Savagnin that's more novel than impressive. The nose offers light citrus and spice, the body is creamy and soft, and the palate sweet with papaya, melon and pineapple. Creamy on the finish as well, and low in acidity.",White Blend
Argentina,"Other than showing orange and tangerine, the nose is a bit too much like air freshener. In the mouth, it's wet but on the hollow side, with dilute innocuous flavors. Decent but low on flavor; seemingly fading.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Big, rubbery and smoky, with exotic fruit aromas that seem roasted. The palate is tough, tannic and clipped, with herbal, thick flavors of berry, baking spices and coffee. Finishes big but flat and hard, with lasting herbal flavors.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Funky and sharp at first, with aromas of a dog fresh out of the rain. The palate is choppy and a bit hot, with sharp, generic cherry flavors along with some carob. Finishes with angular, tart flavors and notes of coffee and mocha.",Malbec
Argentina,"Chunky on the nose, with flat aromas of apple and peach. The palate has a melony feel and sweet flavors of mango and mandarin orange. Finishes sort of heavy and tropical, with a little leftover heat. Good enough but highly regular.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Smells a bit waxy and grassy, with mild, distant white-fruit aromas. The palate feels pithy and chalky, with generic citrus flavors and then citrus pith on the back end. Finishes with more pithiness and white grapefruit.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Warm and saucy aromas suggest a bit of leafiness and volatility. The palate is rather tannic and somewhat hot, with leafy, herbal cherry and raspberry flavors. Finishes similarly, with pepper and herbal flavors.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Hefty but kind of flat on the bouquet, with tomato and herb aromas. The palate has tannic bite and dark, candied flavors of sweet berry and burnt brown sugar. Finishes peppery, with a lingering candied, burnt sweetness.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Fairly bland on the nose, with only a pinch of mild peach and candle wax. The palate is full but wholly generic in terms of flavors: look for sweet pineapple in front of a soft, almost cloying finish. Drink now.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Vanilla and toast aromas are prominent but the fruit is so subdued that overall the wine is out to lunch. Snappy and showing okay acidity in the mouth, but the flavors are dull and melony, with toasty vanilla notes that don't help it enough.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Light and tomatoey in color, with dry, cheesy, earthy aromas. The palate is dilute but has sticky tannins, and the flavors are tangy, citrusy and not overly sound. Finishes roasted and clumsy. An awkward wine.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah
Argentina,"Neutral on the nose except for mild hay and/or straw aromas. The palate is a bit weighty for being so short on flavor. Speaking of which, the wine is clean but tastes hollow, with only sparse flavors of peach and nectarine registering.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Floral, sweet and powdery smelling, but pleasant. The palate is light and airy, with hardly any punch or kick. But that serves it well, and amid the sheets there's lime, green-apple notes and tropical shadings. Not bad for the price.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Raw on the nose, with a hard, tannic palate that features sweet black-fruit flavors, a chemical burn and raisin. The more time you spend with it, the darker and more raisiny it becomes. Finishes roasted, with licorice and rock-hard tannins.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Neutral smelling with a hint of lemon-lime and children's vitamin. The palate is wet but doesn't bring much more in the way of feel, while the flavors are flat, melony and hint at apple. This wine is old by PG standards but not yet dead. It's hanging in there.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Neutral on the nose except for a smidgen of lychee and citrus. The palate is standard and generic, with bland peach, melon and pithy flavors. Finishes light and peachy, with weight and fading acidity.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Earth and rubber aromas dominate the nose, which isn't what you'd call fresh or inviting. The palate improves only slightly, with piercing acidity pressing green-leaning plum and berry flavors. Oaky on the finish and marginal overall.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fairly muddled and earthy at first blush, with a leafy, raisiny, burnt set of aromas. Tastes and feels mealy, with roasted cherry and raspberry flavors and then a leathery finish. Hints at quality but doesn't bring it home; and it seems tired.",Red Blend
Argentina,"An odd bird on the nose, where floral, lavender aromas replace the normal set of cassis and berry. In the mouth, it's so tannic that it's like chewing nails; the flavors, therefore, seem choppy and hard, like roasted blackberry and sugar beets. Very woody and mentholated, too.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Smells resiny and a touch chemical, with cornflakes and vanilla bean notes. The palate is resiny and dusty, with sweet, candied, vanilla-infused flavors that crowd out any fruit that might want to make a stand. Finishes with faux oak notes and more vanilla.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Weak and brambly smelling, with mustardy aromas along with leathery red-fruit scents. The palate is astringent, with tomato, basil and stewed berry flavors. Finishes in similar fashion.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Loud, oily and almost caustic on the nose, with a chemical burn. The palate is better due to its tangy citric flavors, but it's still jumbled and oily, and the finish leaves a burnt-tasting residue.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Roasted and leathery on the nose, without much fruit. The palate is full, rubbery and baked tasting, with herbal berry flavors. Finishes cooked and heavy as well, with a sauciness that overrides any freshness of fruit. A downer compared to the fresher 2008 version.",Malbec
Argentina,Sweet cotton candy and mocha aromas come across as confected and work to obscure a high-acid palate that offers a slight hint of chocolate and mint. More oak comes up on the finish.,Syrah
Argentina,"Strained on the nose, with dirty fruit aromas, gaseousness and candy. The palate is cloying and confected, with muddy, jammy, herbal fruit flavors and a cooked, weedy finish. Bulky but not very good.",Merlot
Argentina,"Roasted and muddy smelling, which isn't uncommon for Cafayate Malbec. The palate is heavy, murky and leafy, with roasted beet and plum flavors. Saucy and herbal as well.",Malbec
Argentina,"Black in color, with a severe, jammy nose that's ominous and heavy. The look and bouquet portend the flavors, which are thick, raisiny and pruney. This is over-the-top heavy and extracted, with an inky outlook and subpar balance.",Malbec
Argentina,"Herbal, green, stemmy Merlot with sourness and compromised aromas, flavors and mouthfeel. Tastes bitter and on the harsh side, with a narrow, grabby finish. Too green and mean, especially for $20.",Merlot
Argentina,"Smells like corn and a burning hay field, and the palate has little to no fruit left. The mouthfeel is wet and grabby, while the finish is bready then turns bitter. On its last legs; wait for 2010.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Vegetal from start to finish, as the aromas begin with tomato and bell pepper. The palate is exactly the same, with baked, earthy, sweet and green flavors. Feels gummy in the mouth, and it's not just herbal on the finish, it's green.",Malbec
Argentina,"Thin and sharp as broken glass, with an herbal, sour flavor profile and a tart, sheering mouthfeel and finish. Compared to previous vintages when this wine impressed, this is a loser. Barely drinkable, it's so lean and sour.",Malbec
Argentina,"Weird, green, spicy and odd smelling, with hard, green raisiny flavors and an herbal finish. Barely acceptable; not varietally sound or interesting.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A scratchy, sheering wine that pushes up against sour. The palate is almost all acid, and the flavors are underdeveloped, very tart and razor sharp. Clean but hard to deal with.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rubbery and gassy smelling, with overtones of green, herbaceous fruit. The palate is sharp and grating, with pie cherry, sour raspberry and green olive flavors. Turns herbal to excess and finishes substandard.",Malbec
Argentina,"Hot and fiery at first, but then it tames itself while revealing jammy blackberry and roasted plum aromas. Feels extracted and full, with a mix of baked berry, herb and peppery flavors that run deep and delicious. Spicy and chocolaty on the oaky finish, with smooth tannins, sweetness and oaky length. Drink now through 2014.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dense, earthy and rich upfront, with bold black plum and berry flavors that hit the right chords. Feels slick, deep and polished, with blackberry, cassis, coffee and coconut flavors that feed into a simmering finish that runs for miles. An excellent blend of Cab, Malbec and Syrah to drink now and over the next five years.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Beefy black-fruit aromas are inviting for their accents of licorice, coconut and crushed minerals. Feels lush, layered and intense, the perfect framework for lusty blackberry, toast, mineral and espresso flavors. Long, warm and dense on the finish. Drink now through 2016; made from Malbec, Bonarda and Cab Sauvignon.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Similar in style to the higher-priced Cobos wine from the same vineyard. Bramare delivers cassis, plum and berry aromas rolled into a pleasant and familiar whole. Feels rich but refined, with meaty flavors that hit on leather, berry, black plum and chocolate. Spicy and chocolaty on the finish. Drink now through 2014.",Malbec
Argentina,"A wine that makes you take notice. The bouquet is intense, with minerality, char, huge black-fruit aromas and handsome shadings of chocolate and coffee. Power and purity come on like gangbusters, and the flavors are a classic mix of blackberry, cassis and fine Swiss chocolate. Heady, smooth and impressive. My highest rated wine yet from Carlos Pulenta's Vistalba label. Drink now through 2014. Composed of 87% Malbec with Bonarda and Cabernet Sauvignon.",Red Blend
Argentina,"After picking yourself up off the floor having digested the price, the wine is excellent but not otherwordly. Sweet, dense and calm on the nose, with alluring black fruit and raisin aromas. Feels hefty and gritty, with rooty, sweet flavors of brown sugar and baked blackberry. Finishes round, big and smooth, with generally good balance. 120 cases made; drink now through 2014.",Malbec
Argentina,"Solid as a boulder and concentrated on the bouquet, with a mix of floral, fine perfume and blackberry aromas. Feels lush, complete and easygoing, with blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors. Graceful and composed on the back end.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fruity, floral and calm on the nose, with nothing aggressive or out of place. The palate is deep, flush and offers great mouthfeel, while the flavors run toward big, juicy berry, cassis and chocolate. Like most Catena high-enders, this Cabernet-Malbec blend features a toasty finish of coffee and mocha, and overall it's stylish and impressive. Drink now through 2014.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Smoky and dark, with serious aromas of black licorice, earth and lush berry. The palate has a great feel to it along with huge flavors of cassis, blackberry, black peppercorn, coffee and sweet coconut. It's stellar from front to back, with coffee, mocha and silky tannins on the finish. Composed of 60% Malbec with 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and small parts Tannat and Petit Verdot. Drink now through 2013.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Approachable, high in quality and made from a mix of Malbec, Cabernet and Bonarda. Smells of lead pencil, blackberry and dark plum. Feels friendly and smooth, with lightly buttered oak leading licorice, black pepper, chocolate and roasted berry flavors. Offers a lot of good things for the price. Drink now–2015.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A savory and smoky wine that impresses with its licorice, spice and bacon aromas along with corpulence and length. There's more than enough oak here, but the sandalwood, mocha and wood-driven spice notes blend into the wine's big-berry fabric rather than dominate. Overall there's fine balance, black fruit essence, depth of flavor and a long, toasty finish. 1,800 cases produced. Drink now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"Compact, concentrated and clean, with all its components in place. The bouquet is dark with charcoal, but bright with berry fruit aromas. The mouthfeel is comfortable and balanced, with sweet berry flavors offset by mild spice and proper oak. Soft tannins define the finish; a fine Malbec that doesn't overdo it.",Malbec
Argentina,"Clean, pure and uncomplicated on the nose, showing depth and clarity. Smells and tastes much like a good Malbec or Cabernet might; it's sweet and fruity, with black cherry, pastry, baking spices and a certain rubbery quality that seems to come with Bonarda. On the money for this variety.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Warm and complete, with oak-influenced char and licorice along with black fruits on the bouquet. An elegant Uco Valley specimen with refined, full-force flavors of cola, blackberry, tobacco and chocolate. Turns more complex and satisfying on the finish. Drink this high-quality value now through 2013. A blend of Malbec at 50%, with Cabernet, Petit Verdot and Syrah.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Cedar and spice are the lead aromas, and beyond that there's blackberry, pepper and floral notes that rain complexity down on the bouquet. The palate is superrich, a bit tannic and deep as night, with black fruit, espresso, syrup and spice flavors. Finishes brawny and long, with toasty richness. Drink now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"A big, warm style of Chard. The nose is soft, toasty and loaded with butter, baked apple and vanilla aromas. Feels full, round and creamy, while oak sits at the forefront of the flavor profile, with toast, apple and vanilla lurking behind. Finishes sweet and smooth. 400 cases made.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Dense and dark, with plum, prune, blackberry and earth aromas. Feels thick, meaty and composed, with blackberry and dark plum flavors leading the charge. Density and balance are the wine's attributes; it's full, mildly tannic and generous but not overdone or overoaked.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big blackberry aromas show very little rusticity. Feels full but smooth and balanced, with a nice mix of wild berry, spice and fine herb flavors. Mellow and not pushy on the finish. Really good for Bonarda.",Bonarda
Argentina,"At first this seems over the top (it's 15.8%). But give the wine time and you'll find the ultimate presentation of ripeness, richness and depth. The flavors are thick and black, with chunky black plum, prune, syrup and more. But it's also healthy and not flabby, with balance and a sense of being. Excellent if you like monster reds.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with cassis, black cherry, blackberry and dusty aromas that suggest leather. Feels healthy, with blazing acidity propelling dark fruit, toast and vanilla flavors. Juicy on the finish due to semisharp acids, with length and liveliness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Deep purple in color, with a dense, compact bouquet showing ripe blackberry, density and heat. Full-force on the palate, with drying tannins along with prune, blackberry, licorice and peppery flavors. Serious and tannic, with richness, extract and power.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with horsey, leathery aromas that are funky and wild, but are surrounded by solid berry-fruit scents. Picks up steam on the palate, which is easygoing, solidly built and just firm enough. Tastes of blackberry, cola, spice and chocolate, then finishes smooth and creamy.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Packed and concentrated, with blueberry, blackberry, bramble and pastry aromas. Initially, it's jumbled and out of joint, with jumpy acids and heavy flavors of blackberry, grilled meat and herbs, while on the finish, the fruit fades quickly, leaving weight, resin and vanilla.",Malbec
Argentina,"Jammy and generous smelling, with pastry and solid black-fruit aromas. Feels good and balanced for a young Malbec, with flavors of sweet plum, blackberry and a medicinal character. Plump and fruity on the finish, and steady wire to wire.",Malbec
Argentina,"Vanilla cookies, peach and nectarine aromas work the opening. In the mouth, there's a nice and even flow of acidity and pulpy tropical fruits. Flavors of tangerine, melon and lychee are authentic and well balanced, while the finish is musky, fresh and confirms the wine's high quality.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Opens with hard-baked berry aromas that turn briary and herbal with airing. Smooth tannins and meaty blackberry flavors are matched by barrel-driven vanilla and spice. Oaky and minty on the finish, with spunk and length.",Malbec
Argentina,"Floral red fruit aromas carry a hint of minerality and garrigue. The palate is lively, with good overall balance. Tastes of ripe red plum, raspberry and vanilla, while the finish is light in weight and quick, but satisfying.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pretty aromas of cassis, cherry and sweet cream are inviting. Feels good, with zesty acidity and nice overall balance. Flavors of black currant, Bing cherry and plum cover the bases, while the finish is easygoing. The epitome of everyday Cabernet.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Potent Malbec with aromas of leather, bacon, blackberry and smoke. It's thick and dense, but well balanced, with flavors of blackberry, cola, pepper and nutmeg. More smooth and easy than complex, with a long, creamy, sweet finish that cements the wine's character. Probably the best Felino Malbec to date, and a good value at 20 bucks.",Malbec
Argentina,"Chocolaty and malty to start with, then more meaty, rubbery and traditional on the nose. The palate is round and just right in feel, while the palate is meaty, layered and savory, with juicy acidity and savory undercurrents. Cutting and food-friendly, and very well-made for a $10 wine.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Lemon rind and prune are the primary aromas, but there's also a hint of green bean in here. The palate is dark and concentrated but not exactly high voltage in terms of power. Flavors of raisin, cassis, fig and chocolate are rich and ripe, while the finish runs dark. Almost overripe but seemingly more jammy than overdone. Drink now through 2012.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Bright, vivid and sizzling on the nose, then zesty, tight and acidic in the mouth, with high-toned plum, berry and red currant flavors offset by a touch of milk chocolate. Long on the finish, but not that nuanced or complex.",Malbec
Argentina,"Exotic on the nose, with aromas of raspberry, plum and blueberry. Shows good intensity on the palate, with a solid feel and fresh flavors of blackberry and dark plum. Fresh but smooth on the finish; very good in every way.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Plum and berry aromas are straightforward, but also clean and nice. The palate on this wine from San Rafael is focused and orderly, with flavors of red fruits, spice and mild woody notes. Long lasting on the finish, with freshness and just a modicum of tannic bite.",Malbec
Argentina,"Warm, slightly leathery and earthy on the nose, with a hint of cheese. Feels full, nice and solid, with decent depth. Flavors of black fruits and pastry are friendly, while the finish is pleasant. Delivers all it can for the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"A big, dark, extracted Malbec with murky lead aromas of Graham cracker and sweet blueberry. The palate is jammy and chunky, with dark, earthy flavors of prune, blackberry and raisin. Finishes a bit pruny, but there's enough acidity to maintain a sense of balance. Drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"A mellow, pure Malbec, with soft, subtle aromas of graham cracker, licorice, blueberry and chocolate. The palate has a welcome freshness that melds acidity and ripe fruit into a correct whole, and the flavors of blackberry, spice, coffee and chocolate work great together. Just right for the money, with blackness, richness and balance. contains 90% Malbec with 9% Merlot and a drop of Petit Verdot.",Malbec
Argentina,"Round, thick and pulsing, but not too hard, angular or tannic. The nose brings richness, smoke and black fruits, while the palate is juicy, focused and forward, with black-fruit flavor galore and a slight creamy character. Drying and toasty on the finish, with snappy acidity through the final drop.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Slick and attractive on the nose, with licorice, blackberry, cedar and spice aromas. The palate is clean, crisp, linear and tannic, with zesty, lemony oak in support of smoky, charred berry and coffee flavors. Consistent from head to toe, with a full, toasty finish. Drink now through 2012.",Malbec
Argentina,"Oak is front and center on the bouquet, and with that come accents of dried cheese and sawdust. Feels saturated, layered and tannic in the mouth, with roasted berry, black plum, herb and spice flavors. Feels and tastes a touch resiny on the finish, more evidence of the wine's barrel influence.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fiery, foxy and leathery on the bouquet, with a hint of latex in addition to ripe blackberry aromas. Feels round and fresh, with a complete mix of plum, berry and currant flavors. Finishes tight and legit, with good length and feel.",Malbec
Argentina,"A very oaky style of Malbec. The bouquet is full of cough drop, milk chocolate and mint, while the palate feels solid and beefy, but resiny. Flavors of berry fruits are softened and sweetened by oak and chocolate, while the finish is woody and tannic.",Malbec
Argentina,"A touch raisiny but lusty and rich, with licorice, mint, black plum and fruitcake aromas. The palate is mouthfilling despite rather pointed acidity, and thus the flavors of juicy blackberry, cherry, pepper and coffee are accurate and appropriate. Long, toasty and yet again slightly raisiny on the finish. Drink now; 300 cases made.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A big wine that handles its 15.3% abv. Smells of pastry, earth and soft berry fruit. Feels round but reticent, with no fire or heat but plenty of blackberry, molasses and coffee. Mellow, toasty and blackened on the finish, with an earthy feel and a baked aftertaste.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sweet oak on the nose results in creamy, chocolaty aromas, along with herbal notes, plum and berry. Feels tight but expansive, with solid tannins, bright acids and solid flavors of herbs, berry fruit, cassis, toast and chocolate. Keeps it together on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Perfectly good, but seemingly more simple and oily than in the past. Maybe that's just perception, but the perception is that this is a mild, tropically influenced wine with a fleshy body and mild aromas and flavors of lychee, green melon and lime. Finishes short and pithy.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Standard cherry and plum aromas create a straightforward bouquet. The feel is hot and choppy, but there's enough body and balance for it to weigh in properly. Tastes of sweet cassis, kirsch and creamy chocolate, with an oaky finish containing cocoa notes.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Forceful from the opening, with floral notes, dark oak, shoe polish and char vying with black fruit aromas. Feels both lush and tough, with hard tannins poking through. Tastes of black fruits, cola and heavily toasted oak. Bittersweet on the finish; lusty and black but neither elegant nor light on its feet.",Malbec
Argentina,"After opening with graham cracker, plum and ripe berry, the wine settles into a thick and heavy place that's rich but bordering on cloying. This is a heavy style of Malbec that tastes of ripe black fruits and herbs. It's toasty, full, thick as can be and long on the finish. Drinkable now but could use a couple of more years for everything to mesh.",Malbec
Argentina,"Heavy and dark, with licorice, fruit syrup and blackberry pie aromas. The palate is lush, deep and chugging along at max ripeness, while the flavor profile pushes blackberry and prune flavors. Roasted and coffee-laden on the finish, with a ripe, ready personality. Drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"Not many 2004 Argentine wines are still on the market, and yet this isn't showing any age. In fact, it's racy and a little sheering, with citric acidity that's keeping it fresh, firm, vital and lively. Flavors of zesty berry fruits come with a touch of oaky vanilla, but not too much. Very nice for a mature blend of Malbec and Merlot.",Malbec-Merlot
Argentina,"Jammy and dense on the nose, with herbal blueberry and prune aromas. This is powerful Malbec, with meaty, sweet flavors of black fruit, blueberry, dry spice and menthol. The feel is soft and easy, with a finish that is smooth and deep but not overly potent.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fruity on the nose, with a friendly mix of pineapple, apple, melon and powdered sugar aromas. Feels smooth and round but not heavy, with good acidity and likable, simple flavors of melon, banana and apple. There's a light note of toast on the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Smells cheesy and leathery, with herbal notes. Feels condensed and flat, as if it's collapsing on itself. Flavors of baked berry and prune are dark and typical of very ripe Malbec, while the finish is warm but basic in feel and flavor. Bullish, sweet and heavy. Not Colomé's best effort, especially given the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with berry fruit aromas, density and slightly medicinal notes. Feels bright and lively, with ample acidity pushing toasty, lightly herbal flavors of blackberry and plum. Shows mild spice, licorice and barrel notes on the finish, along with herbal notes. Seems like a very good everyday or value-driven choice.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cedary and more than bit woodsy, with darkness, char and black fruit on the nose. The palate is rich, concentrated and a touch burnt and black, with blackberry, spice, cedar and mossy flavors. Finishes soft, dark and slightly herbal. Nicely done.",Malbec
Argentina,"Light oak aromas blend nicely with white flower scents and peach notes. The palate is round, smooth and honest, with plump flavors of vanilla, pear and melon. Oaky on the finish, then dry and toasty. Nice for a warm-weather Chard.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Concentrated aromas of blackberry come with leather and dried-cheese scents. The palate is full in depth and solid in feel, with flavors of creamy oak, medicinality and blackberry. Feels rich, grabby and tastes resiny on the finish, but there's enough solid black fruit to override the oak.",Malbec
Argentina,"Honest plum and berry aromas get it going, followed by a fresh, comfortable palate with raspberry and plum flavors and nonpushy tannins. Feels entirely clean, with a pleasant red-fruit aftertaste. Everyday Malbec that gets it right.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fresh, clean and pure, with standard dark berry aromas. Feels round, creamy and chewy, while the flavors tend towards black fruits and no shortage of oak. Tastes toasty and feels resiny on the finish, with vanilla and berry syrup filling up the aftertaste.",Malbec
Argentina,"Meaty, dense and rich aromas, with driving scents of prune, licorice, blackberry and cola. The palate is healthy and rich, and it keeps in step with flavors of blackberry, dark plum and savory spice. Finishes lightly roasted and dark, with a saucy aftertaste that separates it from the masses. A lusty Malbec to drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"A full wine with smoked meat, licorice and black-fruit jam aromas. The palate is healthy, snappy and tannic, with earthy, full-blast berry flavors that veer toward sweet raisin and syrup but then pull back before falling off the cliff. Saturated, dense and raisiny, but still very rich, real and rewarding.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Black fruit aromas feature a touch of licorice. Feels lively and alert, with edgy acids and juicy, forward flavors of plum and wild berry. Toasty, integrated and spicy on the finish, with pinches of green and black pepper.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fiery smelling at first, with aromas of mint, raw oak, coconut and baked berry fruits. Feels rich almost to the point of syrupy, with spicy, lightly green flavors infiltrating the core of cassis and berry. Finishes herbal and stalky, with a lingering green flavor.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"More subtle than your average full-force Malbec. This one runs heavy on the cedar, tobacco and rooty characteristics more so than black fruit and power, but there's ripe raspberry and chocolate to satisfy anyone seeking fruit and richness. A definite warm-climate wine, but it's restrained and traditional in style. I like this wine for its individuality.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pure and inviting, with a touch of char and minerality to go with basic plum and berry aromas. Feels good and grabby, with flavors of sweet blackberry, cassis, butter and molasses. Creamy, jammy and uncomplicated on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Interesting aromas of graham cracker, pastry, blackberry, dark cherry and tomato all work well together. The palate is full and easy, with some weight to it along with flavors of black plum and berry. Not exuberant on the finish; it ends in mellow, lightly medicinal fashion.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Bright berry aromas are comported and good. Feels driving and forward, because of its bold acidity and choppy tannins, but tastes nice and dark, with blackberry and cassis flavors. There's a controlled burn to the finish, and overall the wine seems healthy.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dense and inky on the bouquet, with blueberry as the core fruit aroma and some grass or alfalfa around the edges. Feels blocky and tannic, with sweet, roasted flavors of black fruits that come with a peppery aftertaste. Full on the finish, with coconut and oaky accents.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dry and unusual smelling, with baking spice, cinnamon and exotic notes. Not your normal black-fruited bruiser; this wine spreads out in the mouth, with sweet flavors of nutmeg along with dry plum and berry fruit. Lively and warm on the finish, with zest and an herbal element.",Malbec
Argentina,"A funky, individual blend of Merlot and Malbec from the Salta region, with its ups and downs. The nose carries patented Salta aromas of herbs and green bean, but there's berry scents and oaky mocha to offset that. The palate is forward and shows choppy tannins, while it tastes sweet, herbal and dark. As stated, this is a wine with virtues and pitfalls.",Malbec-Merlot
Argentina,"Controlled on the nose by blackberry, mint, menthol and fire. Like the 2008, this is not the easiest road to run, but it is a blast of penetrating blackberry, boysenberry, heat, spice and dark minty length. Tasty but tough, with the roughness and quality meeting in the middle. Drink in a couple of years.",Tannat
Argentina,"Now at the end of its peak, this is showing mature lychee, melon and soft-fruit aromas along with citrus, mango and nectarine flavors. It's tasty and pure, with only a slight bit of oily harshness that most Torrontés show. Drink immediately or wait for the 2010.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Heavy and brooding, which makes sense seeing that it weighs in at 15% abv. So while it's not exactly ringing with freshness and agility, it scores points for its full-bodied black plum and blackberry flavors, and the oak is well applied. A bit warm and baked, but still good.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Black fruit aromas and rubber on the nose. Feels good in the mouth, with proper weight and balance. Tastes ripe and fairly sweet; blackberry and dark plum flavors turn peppery with time. Easy to drink Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"A little fiery and forced on the nose, but its wild berry and charred aromas it's solid. Feels full and stacked, with plum, cassis, pepper and a mild green element. Smooth in feel on the finish, but herbal tasting.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A heady wine with mocha, chocolate, balsamic notes and black fruit on the bouquet. At first it seems thick and dumbed down, but it opens up to display bold berry flavors, stewed fruit, chocolate and savory accents. It's just lively enough, but overall this ranks as a saturated, bulky, round wine that falls squarely into the category of New World and ripe.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dense, rubbery and solid in terms of black-fruit aromas. In the mouth, it feels right and fades nicely, highlighting healthy, firm blackberry, black olive and herbal flavors. Meets the norms of a very good, commendable Malbec. 14,000 cases made.",Malbec
Argentina,"Like any good Bonarda, this is a tough wine. But on the other hand, it's flush, very dark and full of black-fruit flavors and texture. The nose is piercing but honest, while the palate is big and fleshy, with firm tannins, extract and bright black cherry and blackberry flavors. Thick throughout, with bacony notes to the finish.",Bonarda
Argentina,"An interesting but questionable value with Patagonian individuality. The nose features clove, wild flowers, leather and hot berry fruit aromas, while the feel is clacky and tannic, and the flavors a little baked and stewy. Raisin, heft and berry soup characteristics make this a ripe, full-bodied force to reckon with.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Exotic and unusual for value-priced Malbec, with aromas of blueberry and Middle Eastern spice. Feels chunky yet juicy, with good acidity highlighting lightly herbal flavors of plum and tomato. Meaty, round and solid on the finish, with saucy spiciness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Peach and apple aromas come with a dose of minerality and a kiss of oak. Feels juicy and fruity, with citric acids pushing bright peach, nectarine and apple flavors. Cleansing on the finish, with mild bitterness.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Basic apple and straw aromas are not that intense but are, at the very least, open and clean. Feels easygoing and nice, with acidity giving it a lift. Tastes dry, with white pepper dust mixed with tropical fruit flavors. Turns more stalky and waxy on the finish.",Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay
Argentina,"Earthy and leathery on the bouquet, with a cooked, charred element. Feels drawing but solid, with choppy tannins and flavors of baked berries, herbs and charred oak. Finishes warm and meaty, with an herbal note.",Malbec
Argentina,"Red berry, sweet cherry and ripe plum aromas come with a touch of leather. The palate feels a bit sharp and acidic, with tangy, juicy flavors of plum and wild berry as well as some stalkiness. Cleansing and long on the finish thanks to high acidity.",Bonarda
Argentina,Opens with aromas of black cherry and waves of resiny oak. Has good body and grabby barrel tannins along with a palate that deals dark berry flavor and even more oakiness. Tastes resiny and saucy on the finish; cleans up as it airs.,Malbec
Argentina,"Fresh and a little confected-smelling, then more citrusy and snappy in the mouth, with pink grapefruit and citrusy flavors that make your lips pucker and your palate come alive. Crisp, zesty and well done for Argentine rosé.",Rosé
Argentina,"Fruity and friendly on the nose, with composure and solid aromas. Feels both plump and dry, with toasty black-fruit flavors accented by peppery spice that turns slightly bitter on the finish. Good and dark overall, with limited follow-through on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"On the nose, there's an early whiff of nail polish that resolves itself in jammy black fruit aromas. Good on the palate, with just enough acidic grab in front of a full blast of berry flavors and an aftershock of chocolate. Finishes grapy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fleshy peach, melon and pineapple aromas on the nose. Feels lifted and fresh, and decidedly not oaky, with citrusy orange and nectarine flavors. Fruity, round and easy on the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Concentrated and dark upfront, with black fruit, coffee, chocolate and cheese aromas. Full and extracted in the mouth, as flavors of charred wood, blackberry and black pepper take over. Turns hot and darker on the finish, where bitter chocolate and peppercorn flavors rise up.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Char and hickory override fruit on the bouquet, while the palate is full, round and falls into form with time in the glass. Tastes of forward oak and spice along with berry and plum fruit. Toasty and warm on the finish, but oaky and resiny.",Malbec
Argentina,"Despite all the graphics and obscure references on the front and back labels, this is ultimately a very good wine and a value among under-$15 Malbecs. The Three Thieves team has bottled a creamy, oak-rich Malbec with full red-berry, spice and cocoa flavors. It's soft, subtle and smooth, but tastes and finishes properly.",Malbec
Argentina,"A far better wine than the previous vintage. This is big, beefy and clean, with bacon on the nose. The palate is perky, zesty and high in acidity, and thus the flavors of cherry and plum are forward and alert. Finishes with snap and pop as it begs for pizza, grilled chicken or a hamburger off the grill.",Bonarda
Argentina,"More exotic than many Malbecs, with intriguing aromas of prune, moss and savory berry. The palate has a proper, likeable texture and jammy flavors of black cherry and herbs. Finishes a bit short and hollow, which may be a reflection of tough harvest conditions in 2008.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smells sort of furry and earthy initially, with notes of graphite and woodspice. Feels narrow and grabby, with pointed acididty framing red plum, cherry and lightly oaky, minty flavors. Fits the definition of good but regular Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Inky and superconcentrated on the bouquet, with grapey fruit notes and density to spare. Feels grabby and angular, with some astringency to the tannins and huge flavors of black plum, blackberry and iodine. Thick and sticky on the finish; ripe to the max.",Malbec
Argentina,"Jammy and dusty smelling, with black fruit notes, a touch of plastic and mild scratchiness. Feels tight and grating, with red-fruit flavors that are snappy and tempered by sweet oak notes. Finishes scratchy and tannic, with berry, pepper and licorice flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"An odd blend of Pinot Noir, Sangiovese and Merlot that starts out with aromas of bramble, brick dust and baked berries. Feels tannic and grabby initially, before spreading out wide and flat. Tastes stewy and herbal, with chocolate and spice notes. Probably strained and strange for the average consumer. 600 cases made.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A medicinal quality comes at you right away, followed by chocolate-coated cherry, creamy oak and a distant note of paint or chemical. Feels round and voluminous, with minty, rubbery flavors of oaky, berry and chocolate. Finishes dry and oaky, with a buttery aftertaste.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Starts out with leathery, cheesy aromas and then the nose transitions to heft, prune and blackberry. The palate is good but feels a touch flat, with sweet, candied black-fruit flavors. Falls off some on the finish, which tastes slightly milky. Sweet and mostly ripe, but as a whole it doesn't seem to be 100% there.",Malbec
Argentina,"Oddly perfumed and flowery smelling, with peach and orange notes. Feels jumpy and unfocused, with sweet, almost candied flavors of melon and pineapple. Creamy oak rises up on the finish, where it matches up against stone fruit flavors.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Peach, scented candle wax and matchstick make for a solid bouquet. Feels good, maybe a touch cloying, but not too much. Flavors of crystallized mango and pineapple mix with fresh melon, and the finish is clean. About all you could hope for from an $8 Argentine Moscato.",Moscato
Argentina,"Crusty, rubbery aromas smell a bit burnt, while leather and berry aromas, rest below the surface. The palate is full, edgy and a little tangy, with red plum, herb and tomato flavors. Mild and saucy tasting on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"It opens with raisin and stewed aromas, so its freshness is questionable. In the mouth, it's actually round, subtle and fairly well structured, with oaky vanilla accenting lightly herbal berry and cassis flavors. Herbal as well on the finish, with a lasting flavor of coffee.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Opens with minerally, almost metallic aromas, along with rubber and berry mixed in. Feels fresh and ready, with plum, berry and chocolaty flavors. Finishes with a smooth feel, but maybe it could use a bit more cut and tannic structure. A wine that falls squarely in the middle zone.",Malbec
Argentina,"Stalky and strained on the nose, with a burnt-hay aroma to go with more typical tropical fruit and lychee scents. Citrusy and basic, with oily flavors of peach and apple. Chunky on the back end, with heat on the finish",Torrontés
Argentina,"Jammy and dark, with big berry and coffee aromas. The palate has a hard intensity to it that I haven't seen before from this wine, with bitterness along with black cherry, chocolate and toasty flavors. It's forward, firm and driving, but always hard and angular. In its defense, 2008 was a cool, difficult year with frosts at harvest time.",Malbec
Argentina,"Mild and powdery smelling, with inviting tropical undertones. The palate mixes flesh with freshness, and the flavors of lychee, green melon and white pepper are straight from the textbook. Finishes mildly bitter, which is natural for Mendoza Torrontés.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Stalky smelling at first but good on the nose thanks to a solid berry core and leathery accents. Feels fresh and pinched, with medicinal flavors matched by equal amounts of red fruit and oak. Finishes clean but short, with decent weight.",Malbec
Argentina,"Slightly herbal plum and berry aromas come with a pinch of spice and meatiness. Feels medium-bodied and crisp, with juicy red-fruit flavors of plum, tomato and raspberry. Dries out on the finish, where it becomes more herbal and roasted.",Malbec
Argentina,"Floral and citrusy smelling, with a lightness of being. Feels equally lean and light in the mouth, with fresh, floral flavors revolving around lychee and lime. Tropical and basic on the finish, with an easygoing way about it.",Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay
Argentina,"A little sweet on the nose, with powdered sugar, vanilla and white fruit aromas. Feels foamy but just fresh enough, with apple, melon and controlled stalky flavors. Finishes with dry apple notes. Good for Argentine sparkling; 70% Chardonnay and 30% Chenin Blanc.",Sparkling Blend
Argentina,"Granular and punchy upfront, with heat and animal fur aromas on the nose. Settles with airing, revealing a heavy but solid palate with plenty of oak and candied red-fruit flavors. Falls off on the finish, with mint, resin and herbal notes.",Malbec
Argentina,"There's more good to this rough and rugged varietal than there is bad. It's hugely fruity, perfectly ripe, colorful and full of cola, coffee, black fruit, rubber and length. It'll definitely last in a cellar, and that can only help soften the punishing tannins and mouthfeel that dominate the current state.",Tannat
Argentina,"Dark yet a touch murky on the bouquet, with weight and black-fruit aromas. The palate is plump but healthy, with peppery flavors accenting core blackberry and chocolate. Chunky and proper, if a tad bit bitter on the finish. Gets better as it airs out.",Merlot
Argentina,"Opens with a pinch of green as well as more standard cassis and berry aromas. Borderline sheer in the mouth, with pointed acidity and raspberry and plum flavors. Feels slightly abrasive, but on the plus side it's fresh and juicy.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Rubber, plastic and black fruit aromas. Feels fat and buttery, but with a streak of acidity that gives it pulse. Flavors of red berry come with oaky support, and the finish is sweet, oaky and warm.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Roasted red berry and plum aromas carry the bouquet to a tannic, grabby palate with red fruit flavors and herbal shadings. Feels better on the finish, with tangy red fruit and nothing offensive.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Rubbery on first take, with sweet chocolate and carob aromas. Feels pretty thick, with a creamy lead into an herbal-tasting palate that's crowded with oak and milk chocolate flavors. Turns resiny on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Full of red-fruit aromas, particularly plum and cherry. Feels raw, with wild berry, ample oak and a lot of acid-based tang to the palate. Lightly toasty, with a mild cherry flavor to the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Simple and easy to like, with cassis and cherry aromas along with a hint of earth, moss and leather. The palate is fresh, juicy and healthy, with clean, regular raspberry and ripe currant flavors. And the finish is long and mildly toasty. Good, presentable and ready to drink.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Blackberry and slightly green, herbal aromas start it off, and while the flavors maintain that herbal, green-tobacco core, there's enough body, blackberry and oaky coffee and mocha notes to make it a nice wine. Needs more clarity of fruit, cleanliness and purity to reach the peak, but still good as is.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Gummy, rough and huge, with woody aromas, muddled red fruit and a ton of kick. The palate is narrow and grippy, with tarry, concentrated blackberry and wild berry flavors. There isn't much body or complexity to it; it's full-force, tannic and raw. Shows why Petit Verdot isn't usually made into a varietal wine.",Petite Verdot
Argentina,"Every kind of pepper, from green to red to jalapeño, is present on the nose, along with red plum and spice aromas. Feels tight and zesty, with Italian-leaning flavors of tomato, oregano and basil along with cassis and strawberry. Crisp and agile on the finish, but tastes green.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"White peach and papaya aromas are sweet and tropical, while saline notes play second fiddle. Feels tangy, juicy and lean, with dilute lemon and green banana flavors. Wet and watery on the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Plum, red berry and wild herb aromas combine to create a briary whole. As it airs, the nose turns lemony and hard, while the mouthfeel is tight and limited, with herbal, saucy, red berry flavors. Tomato and basil notes appear on the finish.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Foxy and jumpy on the nose, with candied red-berry and cherry aromas. Feels resiny, but there's enough acid to keep it moving forward. Flavors of plum and berry come with a lot of oak and barrel influence. Finishes resiny, with hints of vanilla and a burnt quality.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smells clean and mild, with peach and apple aromas. Rather foamy and rough feeling, with tangy flavors of stone fruits, green apple and pineapple. Light, juicy and fruity on the finish, but basic. Made from 100% Chardonnay using the Charmat method.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Typically fragrant, with floral aromas vying with mildly green notes of lime and lychee. Feels tangy and downright citric, with lemon, orange, lime and green apple flavors. Cleansing and acidic on the finish, with lemony snap.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Opens with an odd whiff of masa or cornmeal along with herbal berry aromas. Feels angular and narrowing, with herbal plum and dark berry flavors. Turns greener with time, ultimately finishing with brown sugar sweetness and green pepper notes. Good but herbal.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"The opening of lemon, lychee and pineapple is textbook and clean, while the palate is full and oily but not cloying or bitter. In fact, the flavors are pure applesauce and green melon, while the finish is fat and generous. A respectable, honest take on Torrontés.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Despite being six years old, this is still kicking. The nose is raw and stewy, but it's also ripe and rubbery, with cassis and berry aromas. The palate is thick, bulky and chunky, with heavy, chewy berry fruit flavors in front of a slightly baked finish. One-dimensional but not bad for Argentine Cab.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Minty on the nose, with hints of cured meat, burnt field and spice. Feels fresh, with medicinal plum flavors and oak taking over after the fruit falls off. Finishes lightly spicy and drying. More balanced and less oaky than the winery's '09 reserva.",Malbec
Argentina,"Chunky and murky on the nose, with melon and papaya aromas. Feels round but light in the center, with vanilla, pear and melon flavors. Fleshy and simple on the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Burnt and leafy on the nose, with murky, earthy aromas. Feels gritty but lively, with sweet, herbal berry fruit in front of a somewhat dilute and dull finish. A modest, herbal Cab that does the job.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Cloudy to the eye, with overly green aromas of tomato and bell pepper, along with spice and dried cherry. Feels hot and acidic, with a clipped, cutting palate full of berry flavors, herbs and green pepper. Fresh but herbal on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Smells unruly, with animal notes, heavy char, rubber and mulchy earth. Gets better with airing, but seems thick on the palate, with stewed berry and mild green notes. Herbal, roasted and sort of weedy on the finish. Has been better in the past.",Malbec
Argentina,"Stalky aromas of burnt hay blend with white fruit scents. Bland apple and stalky flavors are balanced by decent acidity, then finishes with burnt, oily accents.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Tomato and herbal aromas tell you most of what you need to know about this bargain-priced Cab. It's somewhat green and sweet, with a raw feel and tannic bite. Tastes of tomato and herbal red plum. Feels light on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"The grapy nose announces a heavy, flat type of Malbec with intense color but not much in the way of acidic lift or excitement. Feels gummy, with jammy, sweet flavors of blueberry and clove. Stays sweet and sticky on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Foamy in the Asti style, with metallic, earthy aromas of peach and lychee. Feels pretty good, with sweet, basic lychee and honeydew flavors. The finish is simply a carry over from the palate: it's sweet and melony in flavor.",Moscato
Argentina,"Murky smelling, with nondescript berry aromas. Ultratannic and hard in the mouth, much like chewing nails. Meanwhile, the flavors run herbal and earthy, with dark fruit carrying things to a hard, tannic finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Rubbery and sort of reduced on the nose, with sulfur and gaseous notes. After airing, it shows a juicy but plump mouthfeel with standard, perfectly good blackberry and herbal flavors. Finishes warm, full and toasty, but also a bit lemony and clacky.",Malbec
Argentina,"Given the local competition, this Pinot Noir-dominated sparkler is pretty good. It has a peachy color along with creamy aromas that might be a little oxidized but are soft and easy nonetheless. The palate feel is frothy, while the flavors are of peach pits and underripe cantaloupe. Finishes dry and lively.",Champagne Blend
Argentina,"Solid to start out, with mostly clean, fresh berry aromas and some medicinality. The palate is snappy, juicy and clean, with black cherry, plum and berry flavors. Forward on the finish, and composed for what is essentially a standard Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Slightly earthy and herbal smelling but with enough clean fruit on the nose to make the grade. The palate is fairly flush, with blackberry, baked notes and bitter chocolate flavors. Fleshy and warm overall, with a thick finish that's lightly peppery and toasty.",Merlot
Argentina,"Smells different than most, with blueberry, carob and exotic sandalwood. Takes a dive on the palate, where it's sweet, syrupy and flat, almost like prune juice. Along those lines, it tastes pruny, with chocolate on the finish. Struggles to achieve balance.",Malbec
Argentina,"Strange smelling, with aromas of exotic spices, blueberry and some other notes that don't come across that well. Feels solid and chunky, with herbal, sweet flavors that culminate in a dry, rubbery, herbal-tasting finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Citric smelling, with clipped aromas of berry fruits. Choppy tannins, heat and raisiny, sweet, cooked berry flavors and stemmy notes finish herbal tasting but full in feel.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Mild lemon and minerally aromas are about as expressive as it gets, although you get some apple and melon flavors. Finishes with more apple flavor, a fleshy feel and not much follow through.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Neutral smelling except for pithy white fruit aromas. Feels sticky but not cloying, with lychee flavors that turn bitter towards the end. Short on the finish, with little activity or lasting flavor.",Moscato
Argentina,"Foxy cherry and cough drop aromas are not convincing. Feels astringent and tastes tart, with sharp but candied cherry, faux oak and milk chocolate flavors. Blends sour notes with sweet oak, all to little avail.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pasty and powdery smelling, with a flat, dull-feeling palate. Tastes sweet, fleshy and candied in front of a sugary finish with cotton candy flavors. Too sweet and simple to be taken more seriously.",Rosé
Argentina,"The bouquet is demanding, with burnt tire rubber, horse, heavy char and muddled black-fruit aromas. Feels closed and tastes buttery and burnt, with barrel char and resin sitting heavily atop herbal berry flavors. A heavily made-up wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smells like wet clay with an accent of floral black fruit. In the mouth, it's edgy and sharp, with rock-hard tannins that clamp down. Tastes lactic but not creamy, with sharp red-fruit flavors and a hard finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Green smelling. Feels thick, grabby and stewed, with herbal, saucy flavors of tomato and red berry. That same sauciness defines the herbal finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Burnt and roasted up front, with a leathery nose that doesn't convey freshness. Feels choppy and acidic, with herbal, semitart flavors of burnt berry fruit. Minty and green on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smells grassy, jumpy and foxy, and while it sports a decent feel on the palate, it's herbal and tomatoey in terms of flavor, with a vegetal undertone. Green and oaky on the finish.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Dark in color and aromas. The nose starts out sulfuric and gassy, but settles on rubber and earthy black fruit. In the mouth, there's poking, prodding acidity and basic flavors of blackberry, herbal tea and leather. Grabby on the finish, with a mild acidic scour.",Malbec
Argentina,"Simple and dominated by red fruit and mild green aromas and flavors. The palate has some sharpness due to high acidity, and the flavor profile shows generic ripe berry and not much on the back end. Good but not very interesting.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Smells strongly of corn, stalky fruit, herbs and grass. Mouthfeel is not a problem, although it's a little sticky on the palate. Tastes heavily herbal and green, with an oaky covering. Short, woody and herbal on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Oxidized aromas are not inviting. After the doughy, yeasty opening, the palate deals oxidized flavors of bitter and sweet red plum. Bitter on the finish; barely worth a look.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cloudy to the eye, with strained aromas of sauerkraut and barnyard animal. Feels heavy and tastes rustic, with burnt, stalky, anonymous flavors. Shows bitterness and stalky flavors on the finish.",Rosé
Argentina,"Opens with minty aromas, molasses, prune, fern and chocolate. The mouth is round but tannic, with mouthfilling, heavy flavors of stewed black fruits, herbs and earth. A solid wine but it's short on brightness and seems kind of stocky and baked.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Shows a warm, baked bouquet with black fruit, licorice and toasty aromas. The palate, however, is high in acid, thus it churns and burns as it's offering bright, sheer berry flavors. Crisp and a little hot on the finish, but with good overall flavors and enough solidity to make it a value.",Malbec
Argentina,"Flowery and fresh on the nose, with lemon-lime aromas. The palate is smooth, not too demanding or rough, and tastes of papaya and green banana. It's a dry sparkler with not too much flavor, but it's honest, with a good bouquet and feel to it.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Lightly tropical to begin with, then more sheering and acidic in the mouth, with high-toned, jacked-up flavors of green apple, pineapple and lemon. Quite snappy and fresh, with an aggressive but true and correct finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Blackberry, licorice and leather on the nose lead to a tannic, firm palate with stretched dark plum and black cherry flavors. There's vibrancy and juiciness to the wine, with a firm finish that introduces chocolate. Highly regular, with nothing glaring or wrong.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Opens with sharpness along with red-fruit notes and a hint of vinegar. The palate holds onto that acid-driven feel, and there's saucy, herbal berry and cherry flavors. Finishes on the shallow side, with a pinch of bitterness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Salinic upon opening, with thick, candied blackberry aromas along with orange peel. The wine is sincerely syrupy and rich for a value-priced Malbec, but it struggles with balance and comes across heavy, roasted and loaded down with candied berry and milk chocolate flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"Simple aromas of lemon and lychee are just fresh enough, while the palate offers good feel and pithy, somewhat bland flavors of the same fruits that appear on the bouquet. The finish is lemony, and overall this is a good, basic Torrontés to drink as soon as you can.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Minty and earthy, with aromas of plum, rubber and herbs. The palate is straight down the middle in terms of feel, while the flavors turn brambly and herbal, something the finish matches. Basic and a little strained.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sweet and baked smelling, with foxy core aromas that suggest wet dog fur. The palate is loud and wild, with foxy, unsettled flavors of wild berry and cherry. Runs low on layering, structure and body, but it is lively.",Malbec
Argentina,"Prickly red-fruit aromas open the show, and after that it's briary. The palate delivers a choppy feel along with herbal, briary fruit flavors and earthy soupiness. Finishes with some burn, but overall it's still a decent, drinkable wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Light in color, with transparency, something you usually don't see with Malbec. The nose is rubbery, saucy and a touch grassy, while the palate is tannic and grabby, with stewy, rustic, roasted berry flavors. Finishes with the taste of barbecue sauce.",Malbec
Argentina,"Charred and smells of coffee, toasted oak, minty berry fruit and earth. The palate is quite tannic, with creamy vanilla flavors along with candied berry fruit and lemony zest. Exhibits mostly faux oak and window dressing, but for $11 it isn't bad.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Smells candied and gummy, with sweet, stewy red-berry aromas along with carob. The palate is fairly full and tannic, with cooked, herbal berry flavors that carry over onto the finish, which folds in coffee and grabby tannins. Good enough but sort of stewed and candied.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Medicinal, soupy and not fully clicking. The nose is fishy and the palate has a grating feel and flavors of dried fruits, cola and caramel. Finishes with a toffee-like sweetness and wayward buttery flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with a foxy, jumpy, jammy set of aromas. The palate is also jammy and amorphous, with candied berry flavors and a drab, tangy, almost peppery finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Creamy, bland and short on kick, aromas and flavors. The palate is spongey and tastes of creamed apple, light herbs and white pepper. It's inoffensive but not worth much attention. Finishes a bit vegetal as well.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"A bit sweaty smelling, with pinched grapefruit aromas and distant citrus. The flavors say generic apple and lime, and there's a flatness to it. It's a little sugary as well. OK for a wine with pronounced low acidity.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Smells like a burning hay stack, and otherwise it's neutral. The palate has heft but little else, and the flavors of baked apple run resiny and sweet. Finishes mealy and dull; just another in a long line of uninspiring, mediocre Argentine Chards.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Big and over the top, with chunky, bland aromas of baked apples and overripe citrus. The palate is full, thickly textured and dull, with chunky, generic citrus and apple flavors. Finishes mealy.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Smells like drugstore-quality chocolate mint candy, meaning it's creamy and confected. The palate offers a clash of chubby softness with needling acids, while the flavor profile revolves around faux mint, cotton candy and sharp plum skins.",Malbec
Argentina,"The clean look, nice bead and good mouthfeel are the saving graces here, because it smells strange, almost like steamed ballpark hot dogs, and it tastes odd and innocuous, like papaya juice. The look and feel are good but the smell and tastes are not so great.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Aromas of milk chocolate, candy, field greens and dusty red fruit are less than convincing. The palate has high acidity and a lean body, with flavors of carob, pepper, spice and basic raspberry. Sweet and light on the finish.",Merlot
Argentina,"Burnt, edgy and stemmy/stalky from start to finish. The nose gives off a charred nut and asphalt character, while the palate is edgy, hard and bitter, with briary flavors of roasted fruit and stems. Questionable and compromised for the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"Yellowing in color and smelling waxy and peachy. This has become fleshy and sweet, with a syrupy feel. Drink it now or wait for a fresher vintage.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Mint, mocha and a slight grassiness define the nose. The mouth is narrow and sheering, with high acidity pushing tart, underdeveloped generic berry flavors. Finishes in numb, dull form, with lagging berry flavors that fail to excite.",Malbec
Argentina,"Super floral, like lady's bath powder mixed with raspberry blossom. But that's where the pleasantries end; the palate is rubbery and hard as pavement, with gamy, cooked flavors that narrow down to a tough, tannic finish. Only 250 cases made, so it's more of an experimental wine than something commercial.",Petite Verdot
Argentina,"Blowsy and tropical, with aromatic flabbiness. The feel is acceptable and the flavors of papaya and dry white fruits bring some saucy, resiny qualities. Finishes with sappy, resiny oak notes and just enough Chardonnay character to not be disastrous.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Citric smelling, with floral notes and dampness. The palate is more thin and grating than expected, with red fruit, citrus, cherry sucking candy and graham cracker flavors. Finishes a bit edgy and candied, and overall it's generic with little personality.",Malbec
Argentina,"Candied and faux smelling, with a thin red-fruit palate that's sweet and generic. Fresh feeling due to high acidity but otherwise dull in taste and short on substance, flavor and concentration.",Malbec
Argentina,"Amid innocuous aromas of apple and green banana there's a whiff of dust on a hot radiator. The palate is wet, dilute and lacking in structure, while the flavors of pineapple and mealy apple vie with green notes akin to herbs and lettuce.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Smells like old peaches and tastes a bit like tangy tangerine and grapefruit. It's pithy, lumbering and fails to show any purpose, clarity or crispness. Too strange to recommend, but not undrinkable.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smells oxidized, as if it's dying. The palate is bland in feel and the flavors suggest fermented orange juice. Not hideous but uninspired; shows only a modicum of citrus character and pulse.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"A strange, light-bodied wine with aromas of animal cracker cookies, tangy raspberry and herbal weediness. The palate is weak in structure, with light-framed, herbal red-fruit flavors and a dash of pepper.",Merlot
Argentina,"Smells brambly, sour and muddy, and that's a fair indicator of what's to come. The palate is astringent and seemingly acidified, and the wine's core plum and berry flavors are weedy and murky. Not very appealing.",Malbec
Argentina,"Yellow in color, with oxidized aromas along with a hint of lemon and butterscotch. The palate is heavy while the flavors are bland and suggest bitterness. Does not show this grape in a very positive light.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Murky, stewy, soupy aromas deliver little to no freshness or fruit, while the palate is tannic and tastes bitter, mildly weedy and minty. Seems roasted and devoid of quality. Unclean and unimpressive.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Shows barely any color and then a hard, vapid, no-fruit bouquet. The mouthfeel is citric and the tastes range from lemon to lemon. Pithy, tart and frankly it's a barely drinkable rendition of Argentina's signature white grape.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Smells like corn stalks and also of oxidation. The palate is wet but shapeless, and the flavors are waxy and jumbled. It's yet another pass-it-by, underperforming Mendoza Chardonnay.",Chardonnay
Argentina,Red in color and flat in terms of bubbles and mouthfeel. It smells and tastes burnt and bitter. This is an odd conconction made from Malbec that's barely acceptable.,Malbec
Argentina,"Tapiz's best wine to date, and the first one to shoot higher than the basic or reserve level. Aromas of fresh balsam wood, ripe blackberry and cola are clean and deep. Feels just right, with rich, rewarding flavors of molten berry, chocolate and coffee. Finishes warm, toasty and with focus. Has it all; drink now through 2015.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Powerful, pure and tightly wound, meaning it's a candidate for short-term cellaring, say 2–5 years. Smells ripe and fruity, with blackberry, cola and coconut resulting in a spot-on nose. Concentrated and juicy, with a strong constitution and potent plum, berry and cassis flavors. Toasty and lightly oaky on the finish; 73% Malbec and 27% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Without doubt the most full and complete Chardonnay from Argentina that this critic has tried. It smells lush and toasty, with elegant apple and pear aromas. The mouthfeel is rich and balanced, while flavors of baked apple, vanilla cream and woodspice are endearing. Long and flavorful on the finish, and not overoaked. A serious Chardonnay to drink now.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A fine value among moderately aged Malbecs. Smells like a well-grilled steak along with earthy berry and dry oak. Feels fresh and pure, with proper balance and a lively mix of toast, coconut, blackberry, spice and textured tannins. Compact and just right on the finish. 500 cases made; excellent for under $20.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with lovely blackberry and herb aromas that suggest richness and ripeness but not overt weight. It feels lush and deep, and tastes totally pleasant and easy, with black fruit, toast and pepper flavors. A thorough and balanced blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Syrah.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Pure and striking from the start, with menthol aromas that come with blackberry and cassis. Feels dense and concentrated, with blackberry, prune and dark spice flavors. Layered, mellow and slight jammy on the multitiered finish. Drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with leathery, slightly cheesy aromas before settling on dark fruit. Shows form and layering, with spicy flavors of dried red berry, wild herbs and licorice. Toasty and tightens up on the finish; in good shape for drinking now through 2014. Good value as well.",Malbec
Argentina,"An interesting, well-made blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Tannat that deals lemony oak, spice, coconut and ripe berry aromas. Stocky and firm, with nice balance and bold tannins framing flavors of lemon peel, clove, herbs, toast and berry fruit. A complete package; drink now through 2014.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Yellow tinted, with toasty, creamy aromas of baked apple and pear. Feels round and fleshy but fresh, with peach and baked apple flavors blended with copious toasty oak. Toasty and long on the finish; a high-quality Chardonnay for sure.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Big and forceful and loaded with coconut, mint, blackberry and boysenberry aromas that settle on inky. Quite juicy and tight in the mouth, with sharp acidity and oak-based flavors of vanilla, spice and licorice accenting blackberry fruit. Finishes steady, bright and fresh, but sharp on the acidity. Drink now through 2016.",Malbec
Argentina,"A bright and lifted three-grape blend with red berry, bright plum and mild oak aromas. The feel is firm but round, with raspberry, plum, pepper and other dry spice flavors. Finishes smooth and uncomplicated, with lingering vanilla flavors. A complete wine made from Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"This Malbec-led blend is quite oaky, thus maple, molasses and chocolate aromas ride high alongside blackberry and mild floral notes. In the mouth, this is quasi-syrupy and very rich. Flavors of baked black fruits and brown sugar finish sticky, with chunky weight. Drink through 2018.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Saucy raspberry aromas are herbal and briny. This feels chunky and round. Jammy raspberry flavors turn medicinal and herbal, ending with notes of latex and Band-Aid.",Malbec
Argentina,"Briary and powerful smelling, with leathery aromas of blackberry and dark plum, this heavily extracted Malbec is grabby and tannic. Earthy, roasted blackberry and leathery flavors end with simmering heat. This is a big, fruity and gripping Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Standard berry aromas come with sharp, warm notes. A punchy, angular, high-acid palate delivers potent red-fruit flavors along with an active, fiery finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cherry and plum aromas are aggressive. This energetic Malbec is beyond snappy and juicy, while salty plum and currant flavors are racy and edgy. A briny aftertaste and peppery spice flavors dominate a tough finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cool briary plum and blackberry aromas show lactic, creamy oak, which is nothing unusual for Cobos. Plump, dense and saturated in the mouth, this block-selection Malbec is extremely ripe, with medicinal black fruit and raisiny flavors touched up by mocha and peppery spice. An oaky, spicy finish is par for the course. Drink through 2021.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cherry and plum aromas are aggressive. This energetic Malbec is beyond snappy and juicy, while salty plum and currant flavors are racy and edgy. A briny aftertaste and peppery spice flavors dominate a tough finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dry, briary, leathery aromas come in front of a high-acid palate that's almost shocking in its zestiness. Tart but generic flavors of cherry and red plum finish with a skins-like texture and lasting acidity.",Malbec
Argentina,"Jumpy cherry and plum aromas are fresh and direct. This has a wiry, grabby palate, with raspberry and spiced plum flavors. Rubbery tannins, edgy acidity and reedy red-berry flavors create an intense but rough ending.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Spice, licorice and herbal notes complement red-fruit aromas, while the palate offers plenty of structure and tannic grab. There's an avalanche of blackberry, cassis, fig, chocolate and herbal flavors to process, while the finish is rich and rewarding before breaking up in bits.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Concentrated, ripe blackberry and cassis aromas come with peppery spice and cedary oak notes. This is big and generous on the palate, with roasted, well-oaked blackberry flavors. A touch of heat lends sizzle to the finish. Drink through 2020.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smoky aromas of fresh-cut wood blend with berry and cassis form a welcoming, generous bouquet. This feels lively on the palate, albeit tartaric. Oaky plum, cassis and vanilla flavors finish full and agreeable. Drink through 2019.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tight wild berry and cherry aromas come with a soapy accent. This is blocky and fiercely tannic, with muscular, grapy flavors that hint at blackberry before turning hot and bitter on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Everything about this Tempranillo-led blend rings true. It's full and flush on the nose, with clean berry and snappy tomato and spice notes. The mouthfeel is wiry and bold, with darts of acidity. Flavors span the red-berry spectrum, while the finish condenses in juicy, classy fashion. Drink through 2019.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Bold berry, leather and rubbery aromas show a minerally side. This is a big Malbec-driven blend with nice layering and structure. The flavor profile features reduced, roasted black-fruit flavors along with hints of herbs and leaf. The finish is generally smooth and long, with a pinch of heat. Drink through 2017.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Rustic, rubbery, leathery aromas are highly suggestive of animal hide and stalky berry fruits. This is hard as rocks on the palate, with an astringent mouthfeel. Briny, leathery berry and plum flavors end with a stalky aftertaste.",Malbec
Argentina,"Stewy, muddled, herbal aromas come prior to a chunky, chewy palate. Flavors of compost, nutty berry fruits and turned earth lack freshness, while a stewed finish tastes mulchy and feels tannic.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This is tan in color, with a flat, murky nose of stone-fruit aromas and chemical harshness. A round, oily textured palate tastes of briny nectarine and pithy bitterness. In many ways, this is like sucking on a peach pit.",Rosé
Argentina,"Damp, earthy cherry aromas and saucy plum notes amount to a rocky opening. A grabby, drying, tannic palate and wiry plum flavors end with burnt overtones, a drawing feel and bitterness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Leafy aromas of tomato and green herbs pile on the pyrazines. This distinctly herbal Cabernet is full and chunky in feel, with flavors that follow the nose: bell pepper and spicy tomato lead the way. A peppery finish is herbal to the last note.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Grassy strawberry and raspberry aromas smell false as well as floral. A blocky palate with jammy stickiness and rubbery tannins carries medicinal, resiny, candied berry flavors, with green overtones. This feels raw on the finish while tasting green and jammy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Compact aromas of fresh berry fruits, herbal notes and oak-based sawdust are lively and fun. There's acidic kick to the palate, and overall the body is healthy and balanced. Blackberry and cured meat flavors dominate, while the finish is chocolaty and brings a salt-and-pepper finale.",Cabernet Franc
Argentina,"Dig into this if you like superripe, rich Malbec. This is loaded with graphite, smoky oak, blackberry and baking spice aromas. Expect maximum ripeness across the palate, meaning bearish flavors of berry fruits, wood and toast. There's not a lot of distance or complexity to the finish, but getting that far is half the fun.",Malbec
Argentina,"Mossy, spicy blackberry aromas are more encouraging than what comes after. This is rubbery and astringent, with blackened flavors of licorice and toasted oak.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Sharp berry and cherry aromas are like nail polish. A hard palate offers zero give, while plum and cherry flavors are tart before turning more sour and medicinal on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Extreme ripeness is the first thing that strikes on the nose; then there's raisin, spiced fig and minerally richness that's far from everyday. The palate is huge and fills all corners of your mouth, while flavors of raisin, brown sugar, mocha and coffee come to an almost nonending finish that's the definition of dark and brooding. Drink through 2020.",Malbec
Argentina,"The nose on this blend of Malbec, Merlot and Cabernet is leafy and a touch dilute, with basic cherry and berry notes. An angular palate feels zesty due to lively acidity, while flavors of herbal cherry and plum are somewhat tart and clipped. The finish tastes oaky and feels drying.",Red Blend
Argentina,"The nose on this heavily oaked, extremely ripe Malbec is minty and stuffed with raisiny notes along with wood-based chocolate and vanilla scents. The palate rests on a beam of acidity, but overall this is very thick and dense, with prune, molasses, mint and an abundance of oak influence. On the finish, the barrel element is omnipresent.",Malbec
Argentina,"Among Cobos's high-end 2011 Malbecs, this one comes across as the most complete, layered and complex of the group. Aromas of fine oak and pencil lead augment blackberry and baked plum scents. The mouthfeel is smooth, round and rich, while flavors of tea, savory spices and black fruits dance long into the night. A ripe but not too heavy finish is earthy, calm and complete. Drink through 2019.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sassy passion-fruit and feline aromas set up a crisp, clean-feeling palate with tangy, green, zesty flavors of scallion, lime and sour apple. A minerally, chalky finish is zingy and clean. This is nice for value-priced Sauvignon Blanc.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Spicy red-plum aromas are dry and gritty, but fresh. This firm feeling Cab holds its own on the palate, which is tannic and a bit sandpapery. Tight, juicy flavors of spicy plum finish long, dry and mildly salty tasting.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This is an unusual, exotic take on Malbec. The bouquet delivers cardamom, sandalwood and spiced black currant aromas. In the mouth, it's grabby with pinching tannins. Blueberry and cardamom flavors end ripe, with decent follow through. Drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"Ripe borderline raisiny aromas include earth, cedar and graphite scents. This is concentrated, grabby and fully extracted. Flavors of jammy black fruits blend with spicy saucy notes prior to a finish with flavors of tomato, herbs, salt and gamy meat. Firm acidity guarantees this will last at least another five years before falling off.",Malbec
Argentina,"Minty, ultraripe blackberry aromas are alluring but ultimately familiar if you know the Cobos style. Ditto the palate, which is rich, thick, chewy and full of creamy oak and black-fruit flavors. This blend of 81% Cabernet Sauvignon and 19% Malbec finishes smooth and creamy, with good balance for what amounts to a very ripe wine. Drink through 2018.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"After nothing but busts in the past, this Sémillon is in good shape but won't stay fresh for long. Aromas of hay and stalky fruits are a bit strained. In the mouth, it's got good feel and flavors of nectarine and grapefruit. Bitter almond skin flavors control the finish on this textured, warm wine.",Sémillon
Argentina,"Black-fruit aromas are ripe and a little earthy. This is a thick yet jumpy wine with some aggression to the palate. Flavors of sweet, ripe berry fruits are basic and finish hot and toasty, with a coffee note.",Malbec
Argentina,"Minty green aromas blend with leathery red-fruit scents on what amounts to a gritty bouquet. The mouthfeel on this single-vineyard Malbec is rubbery, rugged and tannic, with a beam of tangy acidity keeping it moving. Flavors of rubber, salty berry and spice are sharp, and the finish is tannic.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sulfur and match stick are the early aromas on this standard Chardonnay. After that blows off, apple and peach scents are pitted against overt oak. The palate feels good, while flavors of pineapple, mango, apple and cinnamon are oaky and not elevated.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Exotic aromas of dusty blueberry, latex and campfire set up a jammy, somewhat clumsy feeling palate with big, candied flavors of baked berry blended with sweet oak and licorice. The finish tastes minty, chocolaty and oaky, with heat.",Malbec-Syrah
Argentina,"Pencil eraser, iodine, latex and blueberry aromas settle better than they start. In the mouth, this is saturated and chunky in feel, with toasty flavors of blackberry, licorice and mint that finish long, herbal and loamy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tight, crisp, peppery aromas offset fruitier scents of cassis and plum. This feels focused and not too big or beefy. Flavors of toasty, rooty berry fruits and spice finish with oak, spice and ultimately a dosage of heat.",Cabernet Franc
Argentina,"Compact aromas of red berries get a boost from oak-based coconut, cedar and graphite notes. This is a blend of three Malbec vineyards of varying elevations; it's bursting with acidity, while high-toned plum and currant flavors are a touch salty. A lively, fiery finish is fueled by latent acidity. Drink through 2020.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rarely does one come across a new-release Argentinean red with this much age (it was bottled in 2008). Aromas of turned earth, sautéed mushroom, tomato and herbs are like a fine spaghetti sauce. In the mouth, this is firm and tannic, with lasting balance. Flavors of coffee, cinnamon, dry raspberry and spiced plum finish with persistence. Drink now through 2019.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Deep, lush aromas of black fruits, graphite and coconut are welcoming and friendly. The mouthfeel is pure and smooth, with elegance and power. Flavors of cassis, blackberry, hard spices and licorice filter into a long, mellow, classy finish. This is a pushy, full-bodied wine that doesn't throw punches; drink through 2020.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cherry, dark berry and plum aromas are perfectly solid. This feels big and rubbery on the palate, with firm tannins and grip. The flavor profile consists of dark fruit, coffee and mint. A hard finish is the conclusion.",Malbec
Argentina,"Oily orange and vanilla cookie aromas lead to a juicy, tangy palate with citrusy flavors suggestive of white grapefruit, lime and gooseberry. This finishes lean, tangy, scouring and lasting.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Alto is 75% Malbec and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon. The nose is cool and full of cassis, blackberry, cola and cedar aromas. This is ripe as they come without losing freshness; flavors of loamy berry and cassis finish with density along with prune and spicy, peppery flavors. Drink through 2020.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Chunky black-fruit aromas are ripe but familiar, meaning the nose is pumped full of richness and oak. Racy acidity on the palate gives this modern Cab spine, while in the mouthfeel stays on the fast track due to zesty acidity. Flavors of cassis and blackberry register as fresh and ripe, and the finish is crisp and not the least bit flabby. Drink through 2016.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"The nose on this choppy Cabernet deals red-fruit, tomato and pepperoni-like aromas. The palate is full of life and tight acidity, while the flavor profile is gritty and includes baked plum and saltiness. A BBQ'd, oaky finish carries plenty of the wine's racy acidity, leaving mild tartness.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This gets going with rubbery aromas of burnt leaves and earth but not much fruit. The palate is medium bodied, with resiny oak notes and jammy berry flavors. Heat and herbal notes rise up on the tail. For $12, this is a good Cabernet.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This ripe Malbec offers jammy blueberry aromas that hint at raisin but pull back in the nick of time. A round pulpy palate is home to black cherry, berry and plum flavors supported by loamy earthy notes. A fleshy finish isn't exact but it's friendly. Drink through 2019.",Malbec
Argentina,"This huge Malbec defines jammy and concentrated. The bouquet is ripe, soft and minty, while the palate echoes the nose with thickness and density. Flavors of prune, raisin, tea and blackberry are borderline syrupy, while the finish is smooth and pure but doesn't offer much spine or foundation. Drink this modern Malbec sooner rather than later.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is always one of Mendoza's classiest blends. There's big fruit, dry wood, bacon and balsamic notes on the alluring bouquet. Full, elastic tannins support cassis and berry flavors as well as more than enough oak. This is dry, lightly herbal, powerful and saucy tasting on the finish. 60% Malbec, 30% Bonarda and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Red Blend
Argentina,"For a basic Chardonnay, this fits the bill. Citrus and peach aromas are standard and clean. The palate is tight and juicy, with no overt oak feel. Flavors of melon and pear have light spice and vanilla accents, while the finish is crisp.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Although this is grassy and wiry smelling, there's enough ripe raspberry and red plum aromas to make the grade. A zesty, choppy feeling palate features plum, pie cherry and leafy berry flavors in front of a racy finish with decent follow through. This is 60% Malbec and 40% CS.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Primary aromas of black cherry and cassis come with minerally notes, herbal hints and a drop of iodine. This feels good but narrow, while saucy, lightly herbal berry flavors end with tolerable saltiness. Drink through 2019.",Malbec
Argentina,"This reflects the big, modern style of Mendoza Malbec. The bouquet is ripe and hefty, with coconut, mint, blackberry and almond cookie aromas. Expect thick, rugged tannins along with toasty flavors of black coffee, chocolate and mint. A dark, fruity finish is more subtle and harmonious than specific. Drink through 2018.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tomato, red bell pepper, plum and currant aromas have a slightly sharp, varietal-related minty, green angle. This feels round and creamy on the tongue, with good acidity propping up flavors of baked berries, spice, chocolate, raw oak and vanilla. A medium-length finish with baking spice flavors confirms the wine's power.",Cabernet Franc
Argentina,"This Malbec-led blend opens with inky, hard-packed aromas of black fruits and grilled meats. The palate is on the rough and tough side, while flavors of ripe black fruits are intertwined with strong oak and spice. Overall, this is ripe, bold and heavy.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Smoky, roasted aromas of black fruits, bacon and herbs are the kickoff. The mouthfeel is plump and full but offers vital acidity at its core. Flavors of black plum, hoisin sauce and savory spices finish smoky and ripe, with a lasting note of bacon. Drink through 2018.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is a big, jammy, over-the-top Cab with mulchy aromas of coffee grinds and ripe berry fruits. The palate has a sticky, cloying feel to it along with flavors of herbal berry, mocha, cocoa and brown sugar. On the finish, it's creamy feeling and overtly rich.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Chewing gum dust, red plum and cherry aromas define the bouquet on this racy, slightly abrasive feeling Malbec. Things taste short and snappy, with red fruit flavors backed by peppery dryness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Initially, this blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Tannat smells murky, leathery and nutty, but with airing it settles and cleans up. Chunky and close to being oversaturated, this full-bodied red tastes of loamy berry and raisin, while the finish is weighty.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Crisp minerally aromas of cherry and blackberry come with toasty spicy accents. This is a tightly built full-bodied Cab with lightly herbal, moderately oaky and saucy flavors of berry and plum. A dry, spicy finish provides for a strong ending.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Cedar, tobacco, mossy notes, cola and blackberry aromas come with a touch of cheese and leather. This is Malbec, Cab Sauvignon and Merlot, and it's tannic and full of grab and astringent acids. Toast, coconut and fudge notes give character to plum and berry flavors, while the finish is choppy and rugged in feel. Drink through 2017.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Smoke and char reign supreme on the bouquet, which is a powder keg of sawdust, coconut and blackberry aromas. Saturated on the palate, this is rubbery, toasty, dark and pumping out black-fruit flavors. A firm, rugged, savory tasting finish brings a hint of salt and cured meat. Drink through 2017.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is one full-bodied, hefty wine. The nose is toasty, minty and a touch herbal. In the mouth, solid tannins support what would otherwise be a syrupy, soft Cabernet. Flavors of baked blackberry and cassis finish with brown-sugar sweetness and length. This is a wine for folks who like their Cabs rich and plush.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This standard Chardonnay opens with blowsy melon and papaya aromas. The palate holds onto that melony feel while dealing honeydew, papaya and fleshy apple flavors. The finish tastes sweet and kind of flat.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Dry, leafy, herbal aromas open this wine. The palate is full and ripe in feel, with amplified extraction and herbal, leafy flavors of spiced plum and mild acidity. Things wane on the finish, which is heavy in feel but mostly just ripe and rich.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,Light aromas of tropical fruits and white flowers are basic and open. An average feeling palate carries sweet flavors of tropical fruits like pineapple and mango accented by vanilla. Throw in a sprinkle of powdered sugar and you get the picture.,Chardonnay
Argentina,"Cassis and cherry aromas are raw and scratchy, but they are also pure and racy. This blend of Merlot and Cab Franc is choppy and fresh in feel, with jumpy acids propping up red currant, plum and raspberry flavors that come with oak-based vanilla. An earthy tasting, rough feeling finish is the closing act.",Merlot-Cabernet Franc
Argentina,"With its light color, minerally nectarine aromas and Provence leanings, this is a good facsimile of Old World rosé with peach and raspberry flavors, a smooth finish and integrated acidic cut.",Rosé
Argentina,"Compost aromas blend with thicker, richer raisiny notes. This feels deep and almost heavy on the palate, where the acidity is modest and stewed, with hints of herbal flavor. Black currant and blackberry come across fully ripe. Notes of coffee, herbs and salt dictate the finishing flavors on this huge Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Crisp minerally aromas of cherry and blackberry come with toasty spicy accents. This is a tightly built full-bodied Cab with lightly herbal, moderately oaky and saucy flavors of berry and plum. A dry, spicy finish provides for a strong ending.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Strong blackberry aromas come with hints of wood smoke, graphite and minerality. On the palate, it is high in acidity and a touch scouring, but also fresh and lively. Common blackberry and toasty oak flavors end fresh and crisp, but short.",Malbec
Argentina,"Hailing from the northern Salta region, this blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Tannat is a bit murky and herbal smelling, with notes of bacon and hickory. The palate is firmly tannic, with pinched, oaky blackberry and saline flavors. On the finish, the tannins are drying and abrasive. Drink from 2015–2021.",Red Blend
Argentina,"The bouquet on this is so neutral there's almost nothing to describe. This is zesty and tangy in the mouth, with pithy orange, lemon and green apple flavors. A crisp finish with citrus zest leaves a clean final impression.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Pungent, feline aromas of sweat, nettle and grapefruit precede a lemony, dilute palate with lime, scallion and green-herb flavors of tarragon and thyme. It's tangy and light on the finish, with a chalky feel.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"This warm-weather Viognier is fleshy and chunky on the bouquet, with generic white-fruit aromas that suggest gardenias. A plump palate is low on acid and heavy in weight; flavors of melon and green herbs finish soft and could turn flabby in a short time.",Viognier
Argentina,"Lemon and apple aromas come with modest minerality. This is fairly full bodied, with a mix of briny citrus and salty, slightly oily tasting melon flavors. A chunky, round finish manages to hold its pose...for now.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Boysenberry and exotic notes of all-spice and cardamom set this Malbec apart from the field. In the mouth, this is typically angular, with sharp acidity and not much cushion. A one-note, linear flavor of rooty plum is neither fruity nor dry, while the finish fails to rise or fall; it just hums along on a singular beam of acid. Drink from 2018–2030.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is a dark, rich, modern Cabernet. The nose oozes sweet aromas of coconut and vanilla along with creamy oak and blackberry. The palate is full and chunky in feel, with dark-fruit flavors accented by molasses and pepper. A chewy finish shows grip and lasting acidity.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"There's a fine line between ripe and overripe, and this awkwardly toes that line with syrupy aromas and a sticky mouthfeel. Along the path are flavors of maple, fudge and stewed blackberry. A jammy, soupy, candied finish is apropos for a heavy, superripe wine such as this.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"The nose on this clunky Torrontés suggests apricot juice and talcum powder. The palate is flat in feel, with bitter, pithy citrus flavors of grapefruit and nectarine. Beyond that there's little to it.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Palo Alto's first high-end wine is a sucsess. A blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot, Benito A shows baked, rustic aromas of sweet fruits and savory spices. The palate is full and flush, while flavors of earthy, baked fruits are woody and saucy, with tobacco, cocoa and raw oak flavors carrying onto the finish. Drink through 2018.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Toasty oak that smells like sawdust is dominant and covers up any fruit that might want to escape. A clunky, raw-feeling palate is home to herbal, oaky flavors and not much fruit. Burn and bitterness come up on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This lightly oxidized Chard is powdery but not entirely fresh, as it shows aromas of pool water and mealy melon. The palate is chunky and just O.K. in feel, while fleshy flavors of melon and peach end briny and mildly bitter.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"This is dark in color and leafy smelling, with aromas of forest floor and herbal black fruits. The mouthfeel delivers a hard belt of acidity and not much else, while flavors of oaky spice and tart berry fruits are adequate but unspecial.",Malbec
Argentina,"This blend of Malbec, Bonarda, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon is oaky and minty up front, with pencil lead and exotic blueberry aromas. In the mouth, this has a fast pulse, while flavors of Middle Eastern spices, cassis and blueberry finish briny but short.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Plum, cassis, herb and spice aromas make for a full, pleasant bouquet. This shows a thick tannic plodding palate along with quick-hitting berry and cassis flavors. Lasting acidity on the finish creates welcome freshness and length.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Crisp stony lightly herbal plum aromas are moderately smoky. This feels flush and pleasant, with a full body and flavors of plum, cassis and tomato sauce. A controlled composed finish benefits from lasting acidity.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Macho grapy aromas are offset by spunky raspberry scents. Fruity and a bit narrow and grabby across the palate, this delivers Mendoza's patented black-fruit flavors wrapped in chocolaty oak. Spice and oak remain present on a full finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tropical fruit aromas are suggestive of bath soap and body oil. This feels obtuse, with depth and an oily sensation to the palate. Chunky, ripe, oily flavors of melon and orange finish loud and ripe, with a deeper set of tropical fruit flavors than your average Argentine Torrontés.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Selección is proving itself to be a consistent modern Malbec (the last four vintages have rated 89 or 90 points). This rendition shows graphite, inky berry notes and savory spice aromas such as cumin and cardamom. It's rich and full bodied, with tobacco, coconut and baked plum and berry flavors. A smooth finish is neither tannic nor overpowering.",Malbec
Argentina,"Chunky berry and cured meat aromas turn sweaty and herbal with airing. In the mouth, this is wholly basic. Flavors of soupy, herbal berry fruits lack definition, while the finish deals molasses and peppery bitterness.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Mulchy, leafy aromas lead to a pinchy palate with salty, hard berry flavors that lack cushion. This is a rough wine with saltiness and bitterness on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Plum and berry aromas are infiltrated by touches of leafy green and leather on the nose of this texturally sound, herbal-tasting Malbec. Flavors of plum and spice are a touch weedy, while baking spice and clove notes take over on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Floral berry and plum aromas are touched up by notes of thyme and cardamom. Fresh grippy acidity keeps this lively, while flavors of berry and plum are spicy and suggestive of tomato sauce. Saucy, herbal flavors rise up on a high-acid finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This opaque, thick-looking wine opens with crusty, toasty aromas on top of an array of ripe berry notes. This is a blocky, saturated blend with flavors of herbs, tomato sauce and salt. A solid feeling finish with mild heat and burn is the lasting impression.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Gritty aromas of saddle leather, horse hide and pickled berries filter into a choppy feeling palate with briny and herbal flavors. There's also notes of berries and salt. A chewy finish has weight, structure and saucy, pickled flavors of savory berry fruits.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is so heavy it's nearly a solid and not a liquid. Maximum ripeness is on display at all check points, especially the palate, which is syrupy, raisiny and viscous on the finish. This is as rich and ripe as it gets, like spineless Port. Tasted twice with inconsistencies; this review more greatly reflects the better bottle.",Bonarda
Argentina,"This is yet another plump, sweaty smelling Sauvignon Blanc from this producer. This vintage is fat in the mouth but kept alive by adequate young acidity. Salty, briny flavors of citrus, particularly grapefruit, end in similar briny fashion.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"This is a leathery, stalky type of Malbec with fierce acidity and a pinched mouthfeel. Try as you might to find richness and heft, this is going to come across acidic and narrow, with herbal flavors and a finish that tastes like tomato and sour plum. For Argentine Malbec at this price point, this needs help.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with wild, foxy aromas that suggest wet animal fur. With time things settle, setting up a plump palate with sweet but fairly bland blackberry and blueberry flavors. Turns hot and woody on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Neutral on the nose except for some generic white fruit aromas and saline. Feels tight, linear and driving, with modest apple and vanilla flavors. Turns more barrel-driven and creamy on the finish. Not stellar at this price.",White Blend
Argentina,"Honeysuckle aromas sing “floral,” but otherwise it's soapy smelling. Feels heavy and chunky for Torrontés, with honeyed, candied pear flavors. Plump on the finish, with adequate acidity.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Familar aromas of cherry, plum and berry are on the money. This is tight as nails on the palate, this and nevertheless thrusts with boysenberry, blackberry and a hint of amaro. A wall of finishing tannin carries flavors of chocolate and black spice. Big, ripe and serious.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Intense on the nose, this has spice, leather and ripe berry aromas. It feels clean, plummy, juicy and bright, with lifted red and black fruit flavors. Showing chewy tannins and additional juiciness on the finish, it's very nice and delivers the goods.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fiery at first, this also has mint and toast notes to the otherwise black-fruit-scented nose. It feels tannic and drawing, but strong boned. Flavors of roasted black fruit are bolstered by olive, chocolate and spicy toast accents. Finishes savory and firm.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This is a hot, earthy Malbec with cover-up oak on the nose. A high-acid palate is drying and hard, with narrow, salty berry flavors and a peppery tasting, scratchy finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is bright in color and loud on the nose, where it's distinctly medicinal and minty, with a strong green component. The palate doesn't differ; it's gritty and heavy in feel, with forced, jammy flavors of mint, grass and bitter black fruits.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"This rusty, light-bodied Cab may be from the current vintage but it looks, smells and tastes like something left over from the past. The bouquet is raw, leathery and leafy, with few pleasantries. A dilute palate with dry, leathery cherry flavors is fresh and light, but strained.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This is herbal, burnt and stalky smelling, then raw and herbal tasting, with weedy notes and a scratchy finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Tropical fruit aromas quickly fade to bubble bath and soap. Has good acidity, with sweet, almost artificial tasting orange flavors ending with some heat and oily aggression, a frequent pitfall of the variety.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Hard and like a match on the nose, with sulfur and peach pit aromas. Has a good mouthfeel to support pithy peach and green melon flavors. Finishes creamy, but with a mild bitterness.",Pinot Gris
Argentina,"Crisp up front, but not overly aromatic or fruity. Feels kind of thick and chewy, with gummy, sweet berry flavors that suggest cherry and plum. Feels a little cloying and cooked on the finish, especially for a young 2011.",Rosé
Argentina,"Kind of mulchy and leafy, with a brown color that doesn't suggest freshness or vitality. Tastes of roasted berry and cocoa, with a spicy, dry finish. Decent but comes across heavy and more oaky than fruity.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Earthy in aromas, with notes of leafy tomato and red plum. Feels narrow and compact, with herbal, slightly tart flavors of red berry mixed with peppery barrel spice and green herbal tinges. Light, then toasty and spicy on the finish.",Merlot
Argentina,"This smells roasted, leathery and earthy, with a mouthfeel that's solid if a bit scratchy. It delivers an intense wild-berry aroma and some of Cafayate's signature complex herbal character. Oaky vanilla and dill notes accent the finish.",Barbera
Argentina,"This is called a “white from Malbec” because it spends little time on its skins during maceration. The color is translucent pink, and the nose is pure wood smoke and minerals due to six months of barrel fermentation and aging. As a result of this unusual methodology, wood resin, sawdust, vanilla and creaminess cover the nose, mouth and finish, while fruit characteristics are hard to locate.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pencil lead and rubbery, mature berry aromas open this wine. The palate is driven by energetic, pounding tannins and flavors of black cherry and tomato, which become more prominent as the tannins and acid rebound. This is an indication of how Argentine Cabernet Sauvignon ages.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Currant and spice aromas are subdued and solid. A strapping tight palate with strong tannins delivers roasted plum, cassis, spice and chocolate flavors prior to a dry spicy finish that holds its own.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,Jammy blueberry and boysenberry aromas include graphite and ink notes. This feels jammy to the point of being sluggish and heavy. Syrupy but not sweet flavors of herbal black fruits finish with a lasting gamy note.,Malbec
Argentina,"This is nice and hints at greater things, but ultimately it's more modest and fluffy than substantive. Aromas of oak resin, baked apple and vanilla introduce a palate with mild acidity and not much structure. Vanilla, caramel, banana and honey- dew flavors finish soft.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Waxy to the max, with baked apple, dry spice and plenty of oak on the bouquet. Thick and mouthfilling in terms of texture, with creamy melon and sweet apple flavors. Turns pithy, stalky and bitter on the finish.",Sémillon
Argentina,"Forceful on the nose, with red berry aromas leading to an angular, high-acid palate with zesty, almost sour flavors of raspberry and red currant. Tastes herbal as well, as the wine's scouring acidity makes for a long but not very flavorful finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dilute and watery on the bouquet, with a touch of lime and air freshener. Feels oily and chunky on the palate, with citrus and not too much else to ponder. Lemony and tangy on the finish, with pithy bitterness.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Reedy and green on the nose, then choppy and clipped on the palate. For a full-priced Malbec, this is lacking in ripeness, body and finesse; it's prickly and limited, with green bean, rhubarb and cranberry flavors. Not bad but underwhelming for $33.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smells like fresh berries and perfume, which is good. In the mouth, it's weighty and sticky, with just enough acidity to keep it pumping. Tastes cranked up and wild, with plum and nectarine flavors leading the charge. Sugary on the finish, with a slightly cloying feel.",Rosé
Argentina,"Foxy aromas come with notes of rubber, creamy milk chocolate and vanilla. It's hot and fiery in the mouth, with herbal plum and cassis flavors. Functional as a fruity, red berry wine but there's not much going on beyond the basics.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Earthy and warm on the nose, this has compost and leafy raspberry aromas. It shows good feel and balance, with light plum, cherry and citrus-infused tea flavors. The finish is good and solid, concluding with a tobacco note.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Leafy and smoky smelling, this has lean cherry and raspberry aromas in the backdrop. This is a tight and linear wine, with strawberry and raspberry flavors that pick up speed. Overall it's juicy, jumpy and legit, but nervy. This may benefit from more bottle aging. Only 512 cases were produced.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Stalky aromas of leathery berry fruits suggest animal and earth. This is raw, tannic and hard on the palate, with saucy berry flavors that fall off towards stalky and stewy. A dense tannic finish is structured but tastes herbal and stalky.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smells wet and salinic, with a slightly acrid note coming on late. Feels tangy, tight and zesty, with oily lime and lychee flavors. Finishes hard, nutty and mildly bitter.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Basic apple and vanilla bean aromas carry the nose to a plump, round palate with tropical flavors and banana. Feels peachy and tastes yeasty and sweet on the finish. Highly regular as a whole.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"This is proof that vintage variation is alive and well in Argentina. Reflecting a hot year, this is stewy and heavy. It smells of licorice, mint and black fruit, while the palate is syrupy. Prune, raisin and stewed blackberry flavors are front and center.",Malbec
Argentina,"Seems like we're catching this wine late in its cycle. It's not very expressive on the nose, and even though there's still life to the palate, it's dealing only mild apple and citrus flavors followed by heat and acidic scour on the finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"This well-aged Cab Franc opens with raw, scratchy aromas that can best be described as abrasive and herbal. The palate brings a hard, acidic feel and high-toned, herbal flavors of cherry, plum and rhubarb. A lactic oak flavor meshes with green bean notes on the finish.",Cabernet Franc
Argentina,"Leathery berry aromas are earthy and suggest notes of cured meat and cheese. It gets tougher and more tannic the more it breathes, with black fruit, herb and spice flavors. Generous but rough in feel, it has a powerful, medium-long finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"The fresh berry aromas are solid, and the palate is plucky and lively, with plenty of acidity to push the ripe, standard Malbec flavors of blackberry and spice. It shows some tartaric crispness and bite on the finish, but tastes right.",Malbec
Argentina,"Hard, minty, oaky and even a touch chemical on the nose, then tough as nails in the mouth. Tastes resiny and minty, with black fruit flavors and extreme tannic clamp. Chocolaty tasting on the finish, which retains the wine's hard personality. Tasted twice.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dark spicy aromas of black plum and black currant are solid. In the mouth, this is saturated and hard, with heavy overall density and strong tannins. A dark, spicy, blackened set of dark-berry flavors finishes with more spice and mint than fruit.",Malbec
Argentina,"The nose on this Malbec-Merlot from Salta is raw and saucy, with more brawn and rusticity than elegance. A compact grabby palate is intense, with herbal plum and hefty berry notes that mellow on a chunky lightly herbal finish.",Malbec-Merlot
Argentina,"With matchstick, pith and sulfur in addition to standard melon, apple and peach aromas, the start is rough. In the mouth, it's gritty and oily feeling, with citrus and apple flavors. Then bitterness and pith come into play on the finish.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Typical orange, lychee and pineapple aromas set it off in the right direction. In the mouth, however, it's angular and lean, with hard, narrow flavors of tart citrus and lychee. Bites on the finish, which is oily in texture.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Sweet, grapey and candy in a glass, with blueberry aromas. Feels rubbery and jammy, with stewed berry and herbal flavors. If ganador is “winner” in Spanish, this doesn't quite qualify.",Malbec
Argentina,"Surprisingly flat smelling and borderline oxidized, with jammy berry aromas setting up a chunky palate with herbal berry and candied flavors. Lacks clarity and does not rise to the occasion.",Malbec
Argentina,"Gaseous, oily and flowery on the bouquet, with lemon and apple notes. Feels round and adequately acidic, with stalky, burnt flavors of lemon and melon. Short and rough on the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Bland and almondy on the bouquet, with an oily accent. Feels lightly spritzy but beyond that it's simply wet and acidic. Tastes lemony, sharp and bland, with a lasting citric finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,Not much fruit shows up on the bouquet but there is a bland sense of vanilla and cookies. Feels heavy but with adequate citric acidity. Tastes monotone and lemony.,Torrontés
Argentina,"Airy and inoffensive on the nose, with a hint of apple. It's fresh but clumsy on the palate, with a rough feel and slightly mealy flavors of cider and white pepper. Citrusy, with a touch of burn on the finish.",Sparkling Blend
Argentina,"Oily, with a peach-pit bitterness to the nose. Feels citrusy but dilute, with lemony flavors that fold in green apple. Wet but bland on the finish. An extremely simple wine.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Hard and capped on the bouquet, with plastic aromas, dry oak, milk chocolate and mint. Feels resiny and cloying, with wood-led flavors and resin. Tastes bland and overoaked for what it is.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"An old-style, rustic type of CS with earthy, leafy aromas of tobacco and dry fruit. Tastes as much of tomato as it does berry fruit, with light oak and tobacco in the backdrop. Dry and woody on the finish, with a remnant of red berry flavor.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A touch green and horsey smelling, with tomato and leafy berry aromas. Feels heavy and bullish, with a beam of acid pushing plum flavors that end in a short, simple finish.",Merlot
Argentina,"Walnut and almond aromas share the bouquet with melon and apple scents. This feels fleshy and resiny, with a generic mix of white-fruit flavors and oak. A bulky, woody, creamy finish with tropical fruit flavors is kept afloat by firm acidity.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Although Argentina is hardly Pinot Grigio country, this is a tropical-style quaffer with good balance and enough acidity to avoid coming across heavy. Creamy aromas of melon and lychee set up flavors of nectarine and tangerine. A lasting but modest finish is fair and appropriate.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"This has apple and nectarine aromas that are a touch briny. It shows good acidity and mouthfeel, with flavors of apple, peach and even some green bean.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Black fruit aromas come with a dusty note and a hint of milk chocolate. This feels straightforward, with flavors of raspberry, mild herb and sugar beet. The finish is short and easy, with an approachable mouthfeel.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tropical and friendly, this feels a little bulky and chunky, but with enough acidity for balance. Flavors of citrus and mango are medium intense, while the finish is soft. Drink soon.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Rubbery slightly grassy berry and plum aromas give way to a fresh and fair palate that works. Oaky cherry and berry flavors are standard but well presented, while the finish is mild, with leftover plum and berry notes.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big, blocky black-fruit aromas are reduced and potent. This is quite chunky and extracted in feel, with jammy gritty blackberry and plum flavors that are mildly herbal and simmer with heat and heft on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Gassy smelling and just not that fresh from head to toe. Feels fleshy but clumsy, with bland melon and almond skin flavors. Narrows on the finish and teeters on bitter, with a lemony wash.",Pinot Gris
Argentina,"Mulchy and green smelling, with soft berry aromas underneath. Feels full and chunky, with herbal flavors, tomato notes and a weak foundation of blackberry and cassis. Minty and herbal on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Raisiny smelling and short on freshness. Full in feel but tasting roasted, stemmy and a little bitter. Finishes baked and earthy, with a lasting leafy quality.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"For the price, this is not a good effort. It's overoaked and horsey smelling, with a heavy, overripe palate that tastes herbal and like hickory-infused blackberry. Flat and stewy on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Moscato-like with its jasmine and lychee aromas, but things fall apart in the mouth. It's overly foamy and active, with bland flavors that lack the powdery, floral elements that can make Torrontés good. Gaseous on the finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Rusty in color, with rubbery, chemical aromas. Feels tight, tannic and clampy, with hard, compromised flavors and bitterness to the finish. Astringent and just not that appealing.",Sangiovese
Argentina,"Straw and hay aromas come with apple and spice notes. The palate is extra foamy and bubbly, with a roughness to it. Tastes of dry peach and bitter melon, with a peppery finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"This one's heavily about the oak. Comes out with spiced-up, minty aromas. Next up is a full and biting palate with buttery lead flavors followed by bitter black fruit. Flashes by quick on the finish.",Merlot
Argentina,"This is oakier and more expensive than prior Trapiche Chardonnays, but it's not necessarily better. It smells like a rubber band and a barrel, bearing resiny flavors of mango and melon, with lots of sweet oak and vanilla tones.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Oyster shell and matchstick aromas come with distant peach and melon notes. Feels good but rudimentary, with peach and papaya flavors that end soft and easy. Drink this immediately for maximum zest and freshness.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"A touch of minerality on the nose comes with apple and lemon aromas. It feels fleshy, with pulpy white-fruit flavors that end with honeydew and papaya notes. Drink now.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"The nose opens with animalistic scents of leather, compost and barnyard. This has an average mouthfeel, with somewhat herbal plum and berry flavors that finish short with a mild leafy character.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Jammy muscled-up aromas of blackberry show hints of spice, especially red chili flake. This feels full, round and comfortable, with moderate tannic clamp. Herbal black-fruit flavors finish bold, with a touch of dry bitter oak.",Malbec
Argentina,"Crisp almost scratchy aromas of herbal red fruits are a bit strained. This feels solid, with ample volume. Earthy flavors of tomato sauce, mixed spices, stewed plum and cassis finish long and herbal, with some grace.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Woody and baked up front, its cooked, rubbery aromas setting set up a surprisingly sheer and sharp palate that's short on substance and balance. Tastes generic, with linear acidity resulting in little cushion or mouthfeel.",Malbec
Argentina,"A reedy, green opening tells you the story up front. The palate is reduced and scratchy, with rubbery, herbal berry flavors that don't register. Finishes bland and weak.",Merlot
Argentina,"Shrap, prickly and sweaty smelling, much like Sauvignon Blanc or Spanish Verdejo. The palate is reflective of the nose: grapefruit and passion fruit along with sourness. Herbal and sour on the citric finish.",Rosé
Argentina,"An opening of burnt rubber, forced hickory and mulchy tomato aromas is none too impressive. Feels tannic and beefy, with leafy, choppy red berry flavors. Burnt and herbal tasting on the finish. Underwhelming as a whole.",Malbec-Merlot
Argentina,"Sweet, mushy and yeasty smelling, and never is this wine convincingly balanced. Tastes heavy, like canned fruit. Finishes bitter, with a banana-like flavor.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Lively but messy, with scrambled egg, wayward yeast and lime aromas. Feels foamy, overly active and acidic, with tart citrus and green apple flavors. Lemony, sharp and hard to hold in the mouth.",Sparkling Blend
Argentina,"Upon nosing, it's sharp, funky and makes your eyes water. Feels foamy and unruly, with nectarine flavors muddled by a pithy bitterness. Finishes with a decent feel and touches of peach and other stone fruits.",Sparkling Blend
Argentina,"A stemmy, weedy wine with a chippy mouthfeel, edgy tannins and grating acidity. Balance and harmony are not in the cards here; the wine is a messy mix of buttery oak and burnt, stalky fruit. The finish is muddled and mills around with no place to go.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smells gaseous and murky, like a compost pile. Rough and not well balanced in the mouth, with simple berry and burnt brown sugar flavors. Hot, heavy and barely acceptable.",Merlot
Argentina,"Initially this smells burnt and gritty, with leafy aromas and a whiff of tar. The mouthfeel is grabby, while flavors of roasted berry, burnt leaves and leather finish rustic and hard.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Piercing, jabbing aromas of wood and berry fruits lead to a juicy, acidic, fresh feeling palate with light, oaky, generic flavors of minty berry, herbs and oak. A modest, oaky finish is undistinguished.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Apple and white fruit aromas set up a balanced, reasonably full palate, with banana, creamy oak, vanilla and apple flavors. It feels solid and round, with a clean finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"This is neutral on the nose except for green banana and white grapefruit hints. It feels melony, with flavors that match the mouthfeel in the form of melon and nectarine. This is flabby on the finish, needing more cut and zest.",Torrontés
Argentina,"A lot of oak hits hard, with initial scents of shoe polish and black tar. This is rubbery, big and forward stuff, with loud plum, berry, toast and oak flavors. The finish stays minty, toasty and slightly bitter.",Malbec
Argentina,"This brand has done well in the past few years with its value-priced Cabernet. This one performs in upstanding fashion, with clean plum, berry and cassis aromas, turning to blackberry and toast flavors on the firm palate. Dark, spicy and a touch warm on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Exotic aromas of wild berries, cumin and other Middle Eastern spices are interesting and inviting. This feels thick and chewy, bordering on syrupy, with stewed plum and brown sugar flavors. It hits with some burn and heat on the bullish finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Inky aromas of blueberry and boysenberry are a bit collapsed and reduced. Tannic and grabby in the mouth, this tastes of leathery plum and salt. And that saltiness carries onto the finish, which tastes briny and shows tannic grip.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Pleasant apple and woodspice aromas are basic and limited but good. This feels balanced, with friendly melon, banana and tropical-fruit flavors. Light oak and related vanilla flavors drive the finish on this easygoing Chardonnay.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A grassy, herbal element is up front on the nose of this Amarone-style blend done in conjunction with Allegrini of the the Veneto (Italy). In the mouth, it's round as a ball, with syrupy richness. Ripe sticky berry and plum flavors finish chewy with residual stickiness.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Reduced rubbery aromas of blackberry and black currant come with a touch of mushroom. This is extracted, heavy and blocky on the palate, while baked blackberry flavors are massive but short on elegance. Bitter coffee flavors, rugged tannins and stickiness make for a heavy finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pushy, smoky, forceful aromas of roasted blackberry and campfire set up a sticky feeling, slightly gummy palate that's full of berry, plum and rubbery flavors. On the finish, this flattens out and becomes heavier.",Malbec
Argentina,"Waxy aromas suggest haystack and dusty apple. This is on the borderline of heavy and cloying in the mouth, while oak is the main driver of the flavor profile. On the finish, notes of melon and banana are covered by a resiny oak flavor.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Tropical fruit and citrus aromas turn toward air freshener and bath soap upon airing. This feels standard for Torrontés, maybe even a bit flabby, with lychee and melon flavors that finish chalky.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Aromas of cedary oak, vanilla and spiced berry fruits are encouraging. In the mouth, however, this old-vines Malbec is jumpy and rubbery, with high acidity. Flavors of stalky red plum taste mildly oxidized and Sherried, while the finish is herbal and tastes burnt. All in all, this just doesn't fully come together.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fleshy peach and melon aromas comme off as chunky and soft. The palate is just as soft as the nose, with melon and banana flavors. A simple finish is friendly but lacks spine, so drink this Chardonnay before it loses steam.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"elon and peach aromas create a bouquet that's nondescript. This feels solid in the mouth, with acidic cut. Flavors of nectarine run sweet, while the finish takes on a cloying feel as it delivers thick melon and peach flavors. Drink now or wait for the 2013 vintage.",Malbec
Argentina,"The nose on this Patagonian sparkler is a stand-in for Moscato, although by all indications this is made from Torrontés. The mouthfeel is smooth, with soft bubbles. Flavors of sugary white fruits, lychee and spiced pear finish sweet and short.",Sparkling Blend
Argentina,"This smells a bit oily and like a match, with additional aromas of white fruits and corn flakes. It feels pulpy but just crisp enough, with pithy grapefruit and sweet papaya flavors. It tastes candied on the finish.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"This is briny and oily on the nose, with grapefruit aromas. It feels citrusy in the mouth, with bitter nut and citrus flavors that turn pithy and more briny on the finish.",Pedro Ximénez
Argentina,"Mild varnish and lacquer aromas stem from the oak influence, and there's not a lot of fruit to offset those notes. It feels plump and a bit clumsy, with briny citrus flavors leading to a pickled, resiny finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Raspberry and cherry aromas are mild while not stirring much excitement. This feels a bit raw and tannic, but it's got enough body to hold up. Berry and plum flavors finish with hints of spice and chocolate.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Berry aromas are a bit stalky, leathery and roasted. This Malbec is lively on the palate, with energy and good balance. A creamy resiny flavor profile is oaky and a touch hot.",Malbec
Argentina,"This smells rubbery, with oaky spice, but airing allows it to expand across a lively palate. Herbal, spicy red-berry flavors are strongest in the midpalate, while peppery flavors, rubbery tannins and scratchiness define the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"A direct blast of reedy cherry and cassis aromas leads to rough-charging clampy palate with high acidity and hard tannins. This tastes of rooty plum supported by bold acidity, while spice, tomato and a dusting of brown sugar are the closing flavors.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Brushy aromas of field herbs blend with scents of oaky vanilla, plastic and stalky berry fruits. This feels saturated and rubbery. A salty flavor profile holds onto the bouquet's stalky character, while the finishing flavors are peppery and herbal, with a hint of sweet plastic derived from oak.",Malbec
Argentina,"Earthy slightly grassy infusions work their way onto a hot energetic bouquet. This feels racy, drawing and a bit clampy, while woody spicy flavors of rubbery berry fruits finish bold and hot like the beginning.",Malbec
Argentina,"Despite showing a yellow color and gritty oiliness on the nose, this feels round and complete, with tropical flavors of mango, papaya and green melon. Everything about this is mild, inoffensive and tropical. Drink now before it starts to fade.",Torrontés
Argentina,"This is typical, textbook Torrontés with tropical aromas of lime and orange peel. Citrusy acidity creates a refreshing palate feel, while tangerine, lime and lychee flavors conclude in a cleansing, non-oily fashion.",Torrontés
Argentina,"This is spicy, dry and woody on the nose, with blackberry aromas. The body is medium in size, with adequate balance and herbal flavors mixed with saline and berry fruits. A warm, oaky, saucy tasting finish shows a hint of green.",Malbec
Argentina,"Earthy, rubbery berry aromas are the set up to a full palate with flavors of rubber, roasted berry, saltiness and plum. A spicy, peppery finish with a spot of oak comes with freshness and good overall feel.",Malbec
Argentina,"Simple berry aromas are generic. This is dark on the palate, with black-fruit flavors that are standard and don't show much character. A lightly toasted finish is solid and not too choppy.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Leathery, horsey aromas suggest rubber and berry scents. This feels alive and a bit edgy, with a mix of resiny oak, spice, red fruits and green herbs on the flavor profile. The finish is a touch abrasive, with a minty flavor.",Cabernet Sauvignon

Argentina,"Woody and dense at first, this smells bright and fruity as it opens. A solid palate houses lightly toasted flavors of blackberry that turn more peppery and toasty on a fairly oaky finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Somewhat murky and smelling of compost and green berry fruit. Feels full and wide, with a hard palate containing milk chocolate and molasses flavors. Finishes bitter, dark and herbal, with gripping tannins. Tasted twice.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Meaty plum and berry aromas come with dark, demanding, minty aromas that are similar to this winery's Lote 44 bottling. It feels astringent, with a resiny oak tone and flavors of raspberry, chocolate and grainy wood.",Malbec
Argentina,"Papaya, lime and peach aromas are basic but clean. The palate, too, feels basic and clean. Flavors of orange and citrus pith lead to a fleshy, sweet-tasting finish.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Raspy cherry aromas precede a scratchy palate that's characterized by its high acid-to-body ratio. It tastes a bit tart and generic, with a red plum flavor in front of a fiery finish. This is light and crisp in style.",Malbec-Merlot
Argentina,"This smells rubbery and like cured meat, and it's not very fruity. It clunks across the palate with squeaky tannins, a lot of weight and foresty, herbal plum flavors.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Spearmint and soft berry aromas turn toward raisin. This feels wide and flabby, with a lot of oak and resin notes in its frame. This is quite oaky, spicy and minty for Pinot Noir.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"A green and herbal style of northern Argentine Cabernet Sauvignon, this smells like tobacco, green bean, bell pepper and oregano. Quite tannic in feel, it bears a roasted herb flavor, finishing savory but green.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Aromas of bath oil, candle wax and lychee set up a chunky palate with tropical flavors of lychee and melon. This blend of Torrontés and Chardonnay is round, plump and just acidic enough to hold its own.",White Blend
Argentina,"This dark-purple Cab is full of berry, horse hide and cola aromas. It's full bodied and chunky, with herbal, mossy flavors of buttery oak, salty berry and earth. A salinic, briny flavor lingers on the beefy finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Sassy aromas of stemmy red fruits, haystack and herbs set up a full yet raw feeling palate with herbal, gr een-leaning flavors of tart plum and raspberry. A shallow finish fades quickly.",Malbec
Argentina,This Malbec rosé is peachy and heavy on the nose. That's followed by a plump palate without much acidic kick. Flavors of fading stone fruits turn mildly bitter on a waxy feeling finish. Drink immediately or wait for the next vintage.,Rosé
Argentina,"Dusty, earthy and herbal defines the nose on this minty Cab. There are also whiffs of animal and pickle on the bouquet. This feels raw and tight, with crisp acids and peppery, lightly herbal flavors of plum and berry. A minty, dry finish is slightly harsh.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Bland berry aromas precede a pasty feeling, cloying palate with lactic, creamy flavors of oak and generic berry fruits. This is drying on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"This breathes alcohol and raisiny aromas, while baked flavors of prune and raisin come with accents of licorice and mint. The finish is stewy in flavor, with a lot of oak and weight.",Malbec
Argentina,"Wiry plum and raspberry aromas are jumpy and a touch candied. This feels bulky and grapy, with an obtuse body. Salty lightly herbal plum and berry flavors end with a touch of heat along with herbal leftovers.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Aromas of cardamom and clove as well as heat make for a challenging nose. In the mouth, heavy fruit combined with chippy tannins create a clipped feel. Ripe berry flavors are a bit jumbled, with oaky spice notes stepping up. A flat chunky finish is missing skip in its stride. This is 85% Malbec with Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah.",Red Blend
Argentina,"After light scents of butter and spiced apple surface, the wine turns briny and pickled, both in aromas and flavors. It feels fleshy on the finish, with briny stone-fruit and citrus flavors.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Mellow and melony up front, with a plump, bland palate featuring mealy melon and peach flavors. The finish has a touch of bitterness.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Oily and mustardy on the nose, then inconistent and not real clear on the palate. It tastes like briny melon and apricot, turning a bit flat on the finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Extremely herbal and vegetal, this is also saturated and syrupy on the palate. Flavors of green bean, mushroom, tomato paste and baked berry are undeniable. It hints at something better but requires too much patience to find it.",Cabernet Franc
Argentina,"Nervy plum and wet-dog aromas set up a firm palate that's herbal tasting. Licorice, medicinal berry and green notes surface on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is floral and candied upfront, with a red licorice note. It feels full and fleshy, with hints of red berry and cassis, with not too much oak on the palate. Ripe, basic, clean and sweet as a whole.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pungent oily, tropical aromas of pineapple and melon come with a distant shot of turpentine and/or chemical cleanser. In the mouth, this is round and melony, with solid framing. Citrus and lychee flavors finish with a light coating of bitter pith. Drink right away.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Savory aromas of beef jerky blend with raisin, grainy oak and sauciness on the nose of this Syrah-led blend. An exceedingly ripe palate feels inky with low energy. Prune, raisin and cassis flavors are encumbered by heavy oak, while the finish tastes both chocolaty and like stewed plum.",Red Blend
Argentina,"This overly ripe Malbec is packed with rooty spice, oak and tree bark aromas. The wine feels sticky and soupy, with a resiny texture and salty, oaky flavors of syrupy berries and mint. A sugary, cloying finish is short on freshness.",Malbec
Argentina,"The nose is yeasty with aromas of apple and hay stalks. This feels lively and citrusy, although the structure and bubble bead are weak. Flavors of briny apple and nectarine finish with a pickled flavor and juicy acidity.",Champagne Blend
Argentina,"The nose is neutral except for dusty aromas and a hint of applesauce. This feels bold, thick and a bit clumsy, with pithy citrus, nectarine and apricot flavors. These notes continue through the wine's finish. Drink now.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A gold color indicates maturation, while loud, tropical fruit aromas fold in lychee, citrus blossom and sweat. The palate is electric due to citric acidity, while flavors of orange, tangerine, lemon-lime and grapefruit finish with a chalky feel.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Briny raspberry aromas are a bit murky. This smacks down hard with acidity, while the flavors run toward earthy, generic plum and berry. A salty finish with animal notes is firm but struggles with cleanliness.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"There's a strong dose of sawdust and faux vanilla on the nose of this flabby Malbec. Woody, minty flavors crowd out the fruit content, while the finish is resiny in feel, and consistent with the palate.",Malbec
Argentina,"This full and ripe Cabernet has berry and black cherry aromas. Tannic, narrow and tough on the tongue, it is blasting with flavors of blackberry, mint and black coffee. It's fruit flavor is met with plenty of kick and grab. Can age for a year.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Mossy and inky in smell, this has a firm palate. Flavors of berry, herb and chocolate set up a dry finish, with structure and background complexities. Spicy and herbal, it has a Chilean sort of character.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"The lighter-style nose that focuses on red plum and cherry is a welcome change from all of the heavy Malbecs out there, but the wine doesn't follow through on the palate. It becomes astringent, with tastes of tomato, stewed berry and cranberry.",Malbec
Argentina,"Grapy and jammy smelling, this feels narrow and high in acid, bearing plum and tart cherry flavors that turn more sour with time. The finish is tomatoey and abrupt.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"The nonexpressive berry and cherry aromas are closed. Light in feel, this tastes of citrus, plum and rhubarb. The lightweight finish is mildly herbal and green.",Malbec
Argentina,"A nutty apricot aroma marks the nose. It feels creamy and sticky, with sweet vanilla and baked fruit flavors. With time it turns more cloying.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"This smells like a forest fire, but it's also creamy and roasted. Tangy and tart, this features narrow plum and cherry flavors that are powered by blazing acidity.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Light on the nose, it feels tangy in the mouth, with sharp flavors of mustard, brine and lime. This finishes with a pickled flavor.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"This is not a consistent wine year to year. Some vintages are true and vital, but this is clunky, with flavors of honeyed white fruits and bitter almond skins.",Torrontés
Argentina,"While this smells floral and candied, the palate rages, courtesy of strapping acidity that creates tart plum and blueberry flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"At first, this smells almost entirely of wood and stalky berry fruits; with time, it takes on a cedary quality but remains leathery, minty and rooty. On the palate this is grabby while stalky, briny flavors of herbal fruits end rustic minty and challenging.",Malbec
Argentina,Roasted berry aromas are stalky at first but come around. This feels round but only marginally structured. Creamy ripe generic flavors of berry and cherry finish solid with some heat.,Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This is a severely oaked wine that sizzles and smokes with aromas of campfire, creosote, road tar and coconut. On the palate, it's concentrated but also brutish. Roasted oaky black-fruit flavors echo the nose, while mint and chocolate dominate the finish. Time can only help this come around.",Malbec
Argentina,"This Torrontés smells round, leesy, soft and short on particular fruit aromas. Due to its age, this feels plump and low on edgy acidity. Powdery citrus and lime flavors end flat, with some burn. This is probably past its prime, but it's still in good shape to enjoy now.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Herbal raspberry and strawberry aromas are raw and a bit green. This feels scratchy as well, with tomatoey flavors of red currant and plum skins. A modest finish is racy in feel but mild in flavor.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A heady wine with mocha, chocolate, balsamic notes and black fruit on the bouquet. At first it seems thick and dumbed down, but it opens up to display bold berry flavors, stewed fruit, chocolate and savory accents. It's just lively enough, but overall this ranks as a saturated, bulky, round wine that falls squarely into the category of New World and ripe.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dense, rubbery and solid in terms of black-fruit aromas. In the mouth, it feels right and fades nicely, highlighting healthy, firm blackberry, black olive and herbal flavors. Meets the norms of a very good, commendable Malbec. 14,000 cases made.",Malbec
Argentina,"Like any good Bonarda, this is a tough wine. But on the other hand, it's flush, very dark and full of black-fruit flavors and texture. The nose is piercing but honest, while the palate is big and fleshy, with firm tannins, extract and bright black cherry and blackberry flavors. Thick throughout, with bacony notes to the finish.",Bonarda
Argentina,"An interesting but questionable value with Patagonian individuality. The nose features clove, wild flowers, leather and hot berry fruit aromas, while the feel is clacky and tannic, and the flavors a little baked and stewy. Raisin, heft and berry soup characteristics make this a ripe, full-bodied force to reckon with.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Smells sweet and artificial, with chemical notes and overwrought vanilla. Juicy in the mouth, with flesh and freshness. But the flavors are oaky, so much so that the wine's citrus and apple quality is masked. Finishes with grapefruit and bitterness. Weird and all over the map.",Chardonnay-Viognier
Argentina,"Opens with warm, baked black fruit aromas and then a wave of woodiness takes control. The palate is round, full and sticky, with beefy but generic black fruit flavors and too much oak. Finishes with vanilla and resin; not a bad wine but needs more balance and fruit.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"A touch tough and stemmy on the nose, but given the price it rates as positive. The body is medium and friendly, while the flavors of raspberry and strawberry feature a peppery accent. Finishes crisp and fresh.",Malbec
Argentina,"While I generally like and sometimes even love the Cobos wines, this Merlot underwhelms. The nose is reedy and stemmy, with earthy, herbal raspberry aromas. In the mouth, it's scratchy and spicy, with herbal berry fruit leading to a mildly bitter finish. Better than in the past, but still a compromised wine due to its minty, green characteristics.",Merlot
Argentina,"Smells both nutty and warm as well as citric and sharp. The palate keeps that pace; it's citrusy and cidery in feel, with orange, banana and spice flavors. Finishes quick and a little heavy. 70% Chardonnay and 30% Sauvignon Blanc.",Chardonnay-Sauvignon
Argentina,"Crimson in color but also translucent, with a candied, slightly green nose. Overall this is a simple quaffer with no excess weight and reasonably good flavors of berry and plum. Bland on the finish, but for $4 who's caring about finish?",Malbec-Syrah
Argentina,"Flat cherry and clay aromas set up a scratchy, almost citric palate with short but bright plum and raspberry flavors. This is basic Malbec with a tart hollow wiry finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Herbal raspberry and strawberry aromas are raw and a bit green. This feels scratchy as well, with tomatoey flavors of red currant and plum skins. A modest finish is racy in feel but mild in flavor.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Saucy plum and wet-dog aromas improve ever so slightly with airing. This feels creamy and sticky, while basic flavors of cherry and plum finish with herbal hints and sweet notes of vanilla and cream.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"The best of the 2008 batch of Trapiche single-vineyard Malbecs is this one from Jorge Miralles' vineyard. Dark, smoky and elegant on the nose, with blackberry, cassis and toasty spice flavors. It's juicy, deep and balanced, with a long, sultry, smooth finish. Pure and showing nary a fault. Drink now through 2015.",Malbec
Argentina,"Amazingly ripe and deep wine from 2004, so it's all that it's going to be. Thick and figgy aromas bring bacon, mint and cool, cushiony cola notes. The palate is megasaturated with chocolaty oak and dark berry power galore. Remains oaky on the finish; a massive wine to drink now through 2017.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Rusty in color, with a mildly mulchy, leafy nose that's also slightly floral and smells of orange peel. Zesty in the mouth, with a lean profile and tart flavors of red cherry, plum and herbs.",Malbec
Argentina,"A lot of oak. The nose is honeyed and heavy, with too much toast and butter. In the mouth, it's got kicking acids but the flavors are sweet, oaky and veer toward banana. Resiny on the finish; underwhelming for the price.",Chardonnay
Argentina,Generic melon and peach aromas precede a slightly forced and sweet palate with melony flavors and some tail-end bitterness. The finish is creamy and shows vanilla as well as peach and toast notes. Very basic Chardonnay given the price.,Chardonnay
Argentina,"Yellow in color, blowsy on the nose, and chunky to the max in the mouth. This wine is big, forced and heavy, with orange, banana and melon flavors. Finishes soft and with no discernible oak or elegance.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Aromas of mealy apple and citrus are less than inviting, while the palate is citrusy but lacking in true Chardonnay character; instead it shows odd flavors of ham and orange juice. Ranks as yet another uninspired Argentine Chard in a long line of such wines.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Dark and heavily extracted, with a big, rubbery, gaseous bouquet that foretells the rest of the wine, which is herbal and full-bodied, with baked plum and berry flavors. Finishes oaky, with drying tannins and heat.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Smells murky, leafy and of compost. The palate is lean, dry and slightly rough, with green herb, tomato and light raspberry and strawberry flavors. Finishes herbal and tea-like, with more earthiness than clarity.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Neutral on the nose except for a spot of peach and citrus. The palate is soft and chunky, with generic citrus flavors that suggest passion fruit and grapefruit. Turns a little mealy on the finish, so drink ASAP.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Forward and simple, with red fruit and citrus on the nose. The palate is lean and light bodied, with tangy, dry red fruit flavors, orange and sour sucking candy. Quite tangy on the finish, and overall it achieves only a certain level of weight and prominence. No oak.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Light cherry and raspberry aromas come in front of a grabby rubbery palate. This tastes like salty plum, with little variation of that theme. A solid finish tastes exactly like what came before.",Malbec
Argentina,"Brambly and wild on the nose, this Cafayate Malbec features a narrow palate with edgy, briary plum and berry flavors. This seems riper with time in the glass, but all the way through it's pinchy in feel and ultimately ends with candied sweetness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dense, inky and sweet on the nose, with cassis, melted Swiss chocolate and well-integrated spice aromas. The palate has size and acidity, with toasty, creamy flavors of baked black fruits and coconut. Long on the finish, with vanilla and mocha; ripe, delicious and potent. Drink now through 2016.",Malbec
Argentina,"Appealing from the start, with minerality, crustiness and tight dark berry aromas. The palate is saturated and layered, with flavors of blackberry, coffee and chocolate. Offers grip and structure due to fine tannins, and it's ready to drink now.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Despite all the graphics and obscure references on the front and back labels, this is ultimately a very good wine and a value among under-$15 Malbecs. The Three Thieves team has bottled a creamy, oak-rich Malbec with full red-berry, spice and cocoa flavors. It's soft, subtle and smooth, but tastes and finishes properly.",Malbec
Argentina,"A far better wine than the previous vintage. This is big, beefy and clean, with bacon on the nose. The palate is perky, zesty and high in acidity, and thus the flavors of cherry and plum are forward and alert. Finishes with snap and pop as it begs for pizza, grilled chicken or a hamburger off the grill.",Bonarda
Argentina,"More exotic than many Malbecs, with intriguing aromas of prune, moss and savory berry. The palate has a proper, likeable texture and jammy flavors of black cherry and herbs. Finishes a bit short and hollow, which may be a reflection of tough harvest conditions in 2008.",Malbec
Argentina,"Slightly green and a touch mulchy. The palate offers a decent mix of red fruits, herbal flavors and leathery notes. Finishes salty and choppy, but overall it's not a bad wine for the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"Seems slightly mealy on the nose, and then comes a tired set of flavors that includes mushy apple and spice. Finishes easy but dilute, with a pithiness that's normal for the variety. It's the current vintage but it already seems passé.",Torrontés
Argentina,"A touch soupy and leafy on the nose, with a green element as well. The palate feel is clacky and firm, with herbal berry and green finishing flavors. Better in terms of feel and structure than flavors and aromas; a marginal Cab from a cool year.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Rubbery and gaseous, and frankly it's just not very fresh or inviting. The mouthfeel suggests astringency, while the flavors are salty and earthy but not very fruity. Finishes with a leathery feel and tannic grab.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Heat and horseradish define the sharp, peppery bouquet. The palate is tannic and grabby, with leafy red-fruit flavors and an added dose of herbs and pepper. Finishes medicinal and peppery. At this price it isn't shining.",Malbec-Syrah
Argentina,"Green and herbal, with a mix of jammy raspberry and weediness to the nose. The palate feels heavy and grabby, while the flavor profile holds onto the bouquet's herbal, tomatoey quality. Overly peppery and green throughout.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Smells a bit acrid, with aromas of peach pit and chemical. The palate is short on structure and offers punch-like sweetness in the mango/papaya field of play. Very juicy but not tasting or smelling very defined.",White Blend
Argentina,"Brambly and wild on the nose, this Cafayate Malbec features a narrow palate with edgy, briary plum and berry flavors. This seems riper with time in the glass, but all the way through it's pinchy in feel and ultimately ends with candied sweetness.",Malbec
Argentina,"This extracted purple Malbec is furry and grapy smelling. A heavy sticky palate feels creamy, while cherry and boysenberry flavors are so ripe that the word syrupy is in play. A note of chocolate and lasting creaminess come up on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Soupy tomato, plum and green tobacco aromas feed into a pinched biting rubbery palate. This Merlot tastes roasted and oaky, with baked plum and berry flavors matched by clove and chocolate notes. A drawing tannic finish tastes stewy and woody.",Merlot
Argentina,"A little bit hickory-dominated on the bouquet, but also giving balsamic notes, blackberry and chocolate mint. The palate is linear due to a streak of cutting acidity, while the palate is also snappy with wild raspberry and bright plum flavors and plenty of wood tannin. A toasty finish with espresso and chocolate is fine and long. Drink now through 2017.",Malbec
Argentina,"Gaseous and rubbery, with leafy compost aromas. Flat, chunky and murky in the mouth, with soft, muddled fruit flavors and a finish of syrup and leftover sweetness. Comes up short on character, quality and clarity.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cheesy and way too earthy and murky to be rewarded with anything higher than an acceptable rating. The feel is scratchy and raw, while the flavors seem roasted, overly earthy and dry.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Nutty on the nose and lacking that patented tropical pop. The palate is maderized and not 100% fresh, with a waxy set of flavors and a Sherry-style finish. Over the hill.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Hard, oily, prickly and not impressive by global Sauvignon Blanc standards. The palate deals semisour grapefruit and passion fruit flavors, and the finish is a monotone continuation of the primary flavors.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Gold in color and about as overoaked as a white wine can be. This blend of Viognier, Chardonnay and Riesling is all resin and barrel spice. It actually offers some sophistication in terms of mouthfeel, but overall it's grossly out of balance and brutally dominated by oak-based aromas and flavors.",White Blend
Argentina,"Smells like sweet apple pie and wax. The palate is sticky and out of balance, with papaya, vanilla and mealy white fruit flavors. Not very fresh; seems to already be turning south.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Starts out with leathery, cheesy aromas and then the nose transitions to heft, prune and blackberry. The palate is good but feels a touch flat, with sweet, candied black-fruit flavors. Falls off some on the finish, which tastes slightly milky. Sweet and mostly ripe, but as a whole it doesn't seem to be 100% there.",Malbec
Argentina,"Closed aromas of red fruits, wet cement and green herbs precede a flat fairly tannic palate. Grinding cherry and plum flavors finish with hard tannins and midland rubbery red-fruit flavors.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This wine has showed no consistency over the years. This vintage is black and extracted with piercing inky blackberry aromas. In the mouth, it's huge, chunky and grating. Overdone black-fruit flavors finish clampy with oaky bitterness and a sense of reduction.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Grainy oak and green aromas rest on top of generic red-fruit scents. This feels chunky, blocky and tannic, with herbaceous medicinal flavors of tomato, oak resin and green herbs. A spicy saucy-tasting finish holds onto the wine's minty green herbal essence.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Soupy, saucy aromas are akin to tomato sauce. This is wide, chunky and struggling for textural balance. Stalky roasted plum flavors finish herbal, spicy and flabby in feel.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Deep and lush, with aromas of blackberry, cassis and coffee. This is actually a better, more balanced wine than the winery's Gran Misterio because it isn't over the top and overoaked. Flavors of mocha, coffee and mulled berry are on the money, while the chocolaty finish is smooth. Drink now due to low acidity.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Smells like floor polish at first. Gets better with time, but still a weak wine of juicy acids, too much oak, not enough fruit and a grating finish. Does nothing to move the dial forward in terms of Argentine Chardonnay.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Smells a lot like compost and green herbs. The palate is bitter, hard and stalky, with grassy flavors and a weedy finish. Tastes burnt out, like old coffee grinds and marginal berry fruit.",Malbec
Argentina,"Hot and horsey, and it remains forced and clumsy in the mouth. Tastes more sour than fruity, with a heavy, short, chunky finish. Drinkable only in an extreme situation.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Jammy and dark, with big berry and coffee aromas. The palate has a hard intensity to it that I haven't seen before from this wine, with bitterness along with black cherry, chocolate and toasty flavors. It's forward, firm and driving, but always hard and angular. In its defense, 2008 was a cool, difficult year with frosts at harvest time.",Malbec
Argentina,"Scratchy raspberry aromas are jammy but also green, with a strange hint of perfume. This feels chunky and rubbery, with stretchy, elastic tannins. Flavors of baked berry fruits, prune and herbs finish hot.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big, raisiny and obtuse up front, this fully extracted Malbec is heavy on the palate, with raisin, prune and cassis flavors that show interior notes of green herbs. This tastes minty, herbal and hot on the finish, with barely any freshness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Grassy, herbal aromas rest on top of basic red-fruit notes. This feels choppy and hollow, with flavors of buttery oak, chemical and red currant. The raw hot finish doesn't have a lot of body or padding.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Earthy stalky leathery aromas suggest modest ripeness. This feels medium in weight, while short salty flavors of plum and raspberry are herbal and arguably a touch weedy. This feels a little hot on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rustic tomato and cherry aromas make for a scratchy opening. This is wiry and grating in feel, with sour plum and red-currant flavors. A fresh but scratchy and herbal tasting finish isn't exactly friendly.",Malbec
Argentina,"Resiny oak sticks out, while the palate is grabby and sticky in feel. This tastes like lemony pushcart hotdogs and the briny water they sit in, followed by a woody, low-fruit finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"There's more good to this rough and rugged varietal than there is bad. It's hugely fruity, perfectly ripe, colorful and full of cola, coffee, black fruit, rubber and length. It'll definitely last in a cellar, and that can only help soften the punishing tannins and mouthfeel that dominate the current state.",Tannat
Argentina,"Dark yet a touch murky on the bouquet, with weight and black-fruit aromas. The palate is plump but healthy, with peppery flavors accenting core blackberry and chocolate. Chunky and proper, if a tad bit bitter on the finish. Gets better as it airs out.",Merlot
Argentina,"Spearmint and weedy red-fruit aromas lead to raw palate. This is more herbal than fruity, with a lean rubbery finish.",Malbec
Argentina,Grapy candied berry aromas mix with loud oak that smells like clove and mint. This has a narrow astringent mouthfeel and strange-tasting berry flavors that end with a rugged finish.,Malbec
Argentina,"This is overripe and raisiny, no two ways about it. Hailing from a very hot year, this feels flat and flabby, while raisin and prune are the dominant flavors. Blatant overripeness and a ton of weight render this out of balance.",Malbec
Argentina,"A lusty value made right. The nose issues black cherry, cough drop and cassis aromas. It's concentrated and balanced, while flavors of black cherry and cassis follow the nose. A mild tannic burn and chocolate on the finish tell you it's good and can go with any meat, from burgers to a quality steak or roast.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Simple and easy to like, with cassis and cherry aromas along with a hint of earth, moss and leather. The palate is fresh, juicy and healthy, with clean, regular raspberry and ripe currant flavors. And the finish is long and mildly toasty. Good, presentable and ready to drink.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Blackberry and slightly green, herbal aromas start it off, and while the flavors maintain that herbal, green-tobacco core, there's enough body, blackberry and oaky coffee and mocha notes to make it a nice wine. Needs more clarity of fruit, cleanliness and purity to reach the peak, but still good as is.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Gummy, rough and huge, with woody aromas, muddled red fruit and a ton of kick. The palate is narrow and grippy, with tarry, concentrated blackberry and wild berry flavors. There isn't much body or complexity to it; it's full-force, tannic and raw. Shows why Petit Verdot isn't usually made into a varietal wine.",Petite Verdot
Argentina,"Herbal berry aromas suggest density, and this is certainly dark full-sized and sticky. Pumped-up candied black-fruit flavors are thick and gooey, with cooked brown sugar, mint and toast flavors on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Aromas of spearmint gum along with a weird coating of oak create a challenging nose. This is high in acidity, to the point of feeling shearing. Sour herbal plum flavors finish rough and bracing.",Malbec
Argentina,Odd aromas of bath soap and tropical fruits are not convincing for Chardonnay. A narrow diluted palate offers low-level lemon and tropical-fruit flavors in front of a sour underwhelming finish.,Chardonnay
Argentina,"Muddy plum and berry aromas lead to a sharp, rugged palate. Tart plum and pie cherry flavors end raw, rough and bitter.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cidery, citric and jumbled on the nose and palate, this is barely cutting it. Briny, limited flavors of mealy citrus fruits finish flat.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Herbaceous red-fruit and forced fiery oak aromas give this a spicy, almost Pinot Noir-like nose. Raw as nails on the palate, this tastes like herbal green strawberry and chemicals. Weedy on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"The opening of lemon, lychee and pineapple is textbook and clean, while the palate is full and oily but not cloying or bitter. In fact, the flavors are pure applesauce and green melon, while the finish is fat and generous. A respectable, honest take on Torrontés.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Despite being six years old, this is still kicking. The nose is raw and stewy, but it's also ripe and rubbery, with cassis and berry aromas. The palate is thick, bulky and chunky, with heavy, chewy berry fruit flavors in front of a slightly baked finish. One-dimensional but not bad for Argentine Cab.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Full and deep berry aromas are the greeting. The wine is rock solid and full in body, with lusty blackberry and wild raspberry flavors along with spice and nice tannins. A complete, balanced, uncomplicated Malbec that gets it right.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark, rubbery and black on the nose, then medium across the palate, with a good mouthfeel and evidence of refinement. The flavors are deep and classy, emphasizing plum and raspberry along with an herbal undertone. Toasty and oaky late, with espresso-like bitterness to the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dense on the nose, with a mix of black fruit aromas and mild herbs. The palate is properly acidic and elevated, with complex flavors of coconut, plum, berry, mocha, chocolate and spice. Quite oaky but the oak comes across well, i.e. friendly mocha and coffee. 64% Malbec with 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Tannat.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Rubbery and sort of reduced on the nose, with sulfur and gaseous notes. After airing, it shows a juicy but plump mouthfeel with standard, perfectly good blackberry and herbal flavors. Finishes warm, full and toasty, but also a bit lemony and clacky.",Malbec
Argentina,"Given the local competition, this Pinot Noir-dominated sparkler is pretty good. It has a peachy color along with creamy aromas that might be a little oxidized but are soft and easy nonetheless. The palate feel is frothy, while the flavors are of peach pits and underripe cantaloupe. Finishes dry and lively.",Champagne Blend
Argentina,"Solid to start out, with mostly clean, fresh berry aromas and some medicinality. The palate is snappy, juicy and clean, with black cherry, plum and berry flavors. Forward on the finish, and composed for what is essentially a standard Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Slightly earthy and herbal smelling but with enough clean fruit on the nose to make the grade. The palate is fairly flush, with blackberry, baked notes and bitter chocolate flavors. Fleshy and warm overall, with a thick finish that's lightly peppery and toasty.",Merlot
Argentina,"Sweet on the nose, with licorice and black pepper dust along with ripe black fruit aromas. The palate is deep and pure, with black fruit flavors and a slightly syrupy underbelly. Burns a little on the finish, with spice and fig flavors providing depth and character. 416 cases produced.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark in color and aromas. The nose starts out sulfuric and gassy, but settles on rubber and earthy black fruit. In the mouth, there's poking, prodding acidity and basic flavors of blackberry, herbal tea and leather. Grabby on the finish, with a mild acidic scour.",Malbec
Argentina,"Simple and dominated by red fruit and mild green aromas and flavors. The palate has some sharpness due to high acidity, and the flavor profile shows generic ripe berry and not much on the back end. Good but not very interesting.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Built like a brick house, with ripe, red aromas. This isn't light and elegant in the Italian style; it's mega ripe, with a ton of cherry, spice, kick and chocolate. Medicinal at times, peppery at others, and deep and wild throughout. Drink now through 2017.",Nebbiolo
Argentina,"Very ripe and leaning towards raisiny on the nose, with baked berry and brushed leather notes. The palate is full and aggressive, with a mix of herbed berry, tobacco and spice flavors. Finishes dry and tannic, with chocolate and a slightly syrupy aftertaste.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Opens with minty aromas, molasses, prune, fern and chocolate. The mouth is round but tannic, with mouthfilling, heavy flavors of stewed black fruits, herbs and earth. A solid wine but it's short on brightness and seems kind of stocky and baked.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Shows a warm, baked bouquet with black fruit, licorice and toasty aromas. The palate, however, is high in acid, thus it churns and burns as it's offering bright, sheer berry flavors. Crisp and a little hot on the finish, but with good overall flavors and enough solidity to make it a value.",Malbec
Argentina,"Flowery and fresh on the nose, with lemon-lime aromas. The palate is smooth, not too demanding or rough, and tastes of papaya and green banana. It's a dry sparkler with not too much flavor, but it's honest, with a good bouquet and feel to it.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Earthy blackberry aromas have a slight baked character. The palate is lush, pure and jammy in feel, with grapey, ripe flavors of black cherry, blackberry and herbs. Finishes warm, spicy and peppery, but with good feel and length.",Malbec
Argentina,"Soft and lightly cedary on the nose, with earthy berry fruit aromas. The palate shows good acidity and balance, with ripe cherry, raspberry and cassis flavors. Smooth on the finish, and overall there aren't any breaks in the fabric.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A bit rooty and smoky on the nose, with grapey, loud flavors of sweet berry, black plum and chocolate. The palate is full of choppy acids that keep it pumping forth, while the finish is richer and more chocolaty, with fig notes. A bruiser, but one that's very good for varietal PV.",Petit Verdot
Argentina,"Big, fleshy and dark in color, with a bold, heavy nose of black fruits, baked richness and sweet characteristics. The palate is chunky and full, with blackberry, baked plum, fig and herbal flavors. A saturated, lusty style of Malbec that's deep like cake and just about as sweet.",Malbec
Argentina,"Potent and dark, with a syrupy nose of mint, blackberry and cream. The palate feel is more choppy than ideal, while the flavors run towards cola, root beer, pepper and baked black fruits. Coconut appears on the finish along with pepper; Malbec, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon comprise this Bordeaux blend.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Smoky, roasted and full on the bouquet, with rich berry and plum aromas. The palate is fleshy, with a chunky middle but just enough tannin and acid to provide structure. Tastes of baked black fruits, fig and herbs. Dry and snappy on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lightly tropical to begin with, then more sheering and acidic in the mouth, with high-toned, jacked-up flavors of green apple, pineapple and lemon. Quite snappy and fresh, with an aggressive but true and correct finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Blackberry, licorice and leather on the nose lead to a tannic, firm palate with stretched dark plum and black cherry flavors. There's vibrancy and juiciness to the wine, with a firm finish that introduces chocolate. Highly regular, with nothing glaring or wrong.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Opens with sharpness along with red-fruit notes and a hint of vinegar. The palate holds onto that acid-driven feel, and there's saucy, herbal berry and cherry flavors. Finishes on the shallow side, with a pinch of bitterness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Salinic upon opening, with thick, candied blackberry aromas along with orange peel. The wine is sincerely syrupy and rich for a value-priced Malbec, but it struggles with balance and comes across heavy, roasted and loaded down with candied berry and milk chocolate flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"Simple aromas of lemon and lychee are just fresh enough, while the palate offers good feel and pithy, somewhat bland flavors of the same fruits that appear on the bouquet. The finish is lemony, and overall this is a good, basic Torrontés to drink as soon as you can.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Minty and earthy, with aromas of plum, rubber and herbs. The palate is straight down the middle in terms of feel, while the flavors turn brambly and herbal, something the finish matches. Basic and a little strained.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sweet and baked smelling, with foxy core aromas that suggest wet dog fur. The palate is loud and wild, with foxy, unsettled flavors of wild berry and cherry. Runs low on layering, structure and body, but it is lively.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sweet, rich and clean, with molasses, fig and pure berry fruit aromas. Rich and saturated, but balanced, with blackberry, brown sugar and chocolaty flavors. Finishes fairly long, with spice and some complexity. A surprisingly good bargain Cab.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Earthy and leathery on first blush, with tobacco and jammy berry and bacony aromas. The palate is drawn and firm, with snappy wild berry flavors accented by softer earth notes and coconutty oak. Layered and chocolaty on the finish, with a good fade. 85% Malbec with 15% Cabernet Sauvignon; 200 cases made.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with tarry, cooked aromas but with airing, oak and ripe, earthy berry notes squeak out. The palate is chewy and solid, with extract and tannic grab as well as smoky, sultry flavors of roasted black fruits and bouillon. Meaty and satisfying.",Malbec
Argentina,"Prickly red-fruit aromas open the show, and after that it's briary. The palate delivers a choppy feel along with herbal, briary fruit flavors and earthy soupiness. Finishes with some burn, but overall it's still a decent, drinkable wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Light in color, with transparency, something you usually don't see with Malbec. The nose is rubbery, saucy and a touch grassy, while the palate is tannic and grabby, with stewy, rustic, roasted berry flavors. Finishes with the taste of barbecue sauce.",Malbec
Argentina,"Charred and smells of coffee, toasted oak, minty berry fruit and earth. The palate is quite tannic, with creamy vanilla flavors along with candied berry fruit and lemony zest. Exhibits mostly faux oak and window dressing, but for $11 it isn't bad.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Offers tropical, stony aromas in front of a crystalline palate that's citrusy as well as peachy, with lychee and melon flavors as well. Finishes springy and bright, with green citrus zest and nothing compromising. 60% Torrontés and 40% Chardonnay.",White Blend
Argentina,"Deep, dense Malbec with jammy aromas of blackberry and violet flowers. The palate is thick and meaty but not cloying or oaky, while the plum, berry and currant flavors are appealing. Textured and full, but also bright and healthy.",Malbec
Argentina,"The cool, compromising 2008 vintage conditions are reflected here; the wine is jammy but a little green on the nose and at its core. The feel is heavy, lactic and rich, while the flavors are narrow and jammy, with prune, blackberry and grassy mint. There's both overripe and underripe notes on this high-end blend of 70% Malbec and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Gold in color, with a heavy, mature, resiny nose. But just when you think it's over the hill and overoaked, the palate offers acidity and character. Flavors of apple, melon and spice are barrel-influenced, while acidity props up the finish. Drink now; contains 10% Chardonnay.",Sémillon
Argentina,"Smells candied and gummy, with sweet, stewy red-berry aromas along with carob. The palate is fairly full and tannic, with cooked, herbal berry flavors that carry over onto the finish, which folds in coffee and grabby tannins. Good enough but sort of stewed and candied.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Medicinal, soupy and not fully clicking. The nose is fishy and the palate has a grating feel and flavors of dried fruits, cola and caramel. Finishes with a toffee-like sweetness and wayward buttery flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with a foxy, jumpy, jammy set of aromas. The palate is also jammy and amorphous, with candied berry flavors and a drab, tangy, almost peppery finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Creamy, bland and short on kick, aromas and flavors. The palate is spongey and tastes of creamed apple, light herbs and white pepper. It's inoffensive but not worth much attention. Finishes a bit vegetal as well.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Tropical aromas are fresh and clean, and overall this is an active, juicy wine with bright flavors of pineapple, melon and lime. There's pop, proper acids and drive to the finish; shows the good elements of the grape at an easy-to-swallow price.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Rich, sweet and ripe up front, with aromas of molasses, black fruits and spice. The palate is concentrated and full, with roasted, beefy flavors of berry, plum and spice. A sizable finish anchors the wine's weighty personality. Big and generous given the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lime and floral notes create a light and breezy bouquet that's easygoing. In the mouth, it's juicy and fresh, with lemon-lime, peach, nectarine and lychee flavors. Tangy and fresh on the finish, and more precise and delicate than most Argentinean Torrontés.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Despite leafy, herbal, briney notes, the nose on this four-grape blend is earthy, subtle and attractive. The palate is full and concentrated, with flavors of roast meat, spice, herbs and baked berry fruits. Finishes savory. 40% each Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with 10% each Malbec and Pinot Noir.",Red Blend
Argentina,"At 90% Tempranillo, this is not your average Argentine red. The nose is lean and hot, with spice that grows on you. The palate is piercing, but amid the acid and racy cherry and raspberry fruit are touches of elegant dryness, olive, leaves and old Rioja. Will age for a decade due to blazing acidity.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A bit sweaty smelling, with pinched grapefruit aromas and distant citrus. The flavors say generic apple and lime, and there's a flatness to it. It's a little sugary as well. OK for a wine with pronounced low acidity.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Smells like a burning hay stack, and otherwise it's neutral. The palate has heft but little else, and the flavors of baked apple run resiny and sweet. Finishes mealy and dull; just another in a long line of uninspiring, mediocre Argentine Chards.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Big and over the top, with chunky, bland aromas of baked apples and overripe citrus. The palate is full, thickly textured and dull, with chunky, generic citrus and apple flavors. Finishes mealy.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Smells like drugstore-quality chocolate mint candy, meaning it's creamy and confected. The palate offers a clash of chubby softness with needling acids, while the flavor profile revolves around faux mint, cotton candy and sharp plum skins.",Malbec
Argentina,"The clean look, nice bead and good mouthfeel are the saving graces here, because it smells strange, almost like steamed ballpark hot dogs, and it tastes odd and innocuous, like papaya juice. The look and feel are good but the smell and tastes are not so great.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Aromas of milk chocolate, candy, field greens and dusty red fruit are less than convincing. The palate has high acidity and a lean body, with flavors of carob, pepper, spice and basic raspberry. Sweet and light on the finish.",Merlot
Argentina,"Burnt, edgy and stemmy/stalky from start to finish. The nose gives off a charred nut and asphalt character, while the palate is edgy, hard and bitter, with briary flavors of roasted fruit and stems. Questionable and compromised for the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"Yellowing in color and smelling waxy and peachy. This has become fleshy and sweet, with a syrupy feel. Drink it now or wait for a fresher vintage.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Mint, mocha and a slight grassiness define the nose. The mouth is narrow and sheering, with high acidity pushing tart, underdeveloped generic berry flavors. Finishes in numb, dull form, with lagging berry flavors that fail to excite.",Malbec
Argentina,"Early aromas of compost and leather settle on earthy and leathery, with briar and olive. The palate is saturated and tannic, with a pretty fierce bite and flavors of roasted plum, tobacco and leather. More rough and herbal than past vintages; drink now through 2015.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Cherry, plum, bacon and licorice are all good aromas that indicate that this value wine has quality backing it up. The palate is fresh and clean, with depth and ripe, slightly oaked flavors of cassis, blackberry and chocolate. Easy to like, with toasty touches throughout.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Sweet, rich plum and spice aromas precede a juicy, ripe palate that's right in terms of feel. Blackberry, spice and light herbal flavors are nice, while the finish is chocolaty and smooth. Very nice in an average, understandable way.",Merlot
Argentina,"Super floral, like lady's bath powder mixed with raspberry blossom. But that's where the pleasantries end; the palate is rubbery and hard as pavement, with gamy, cooked flavors that narrow down to a tough, tannic finish. Only 250 cases made, so it's more of an experimental wine than something commercial.",Petite Verdot
Argentina,"Blowsy and tropical, with aromatic flabbiness. The feel is acceptable and the flavors of papaya and dry white fruits bring some saucy, resiny qualities. Finishes with sappy, resiny oak notes and just enough Chardonnay character to not be disastrous.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Citric smelling, with floral notes and dampness. The palate is more thin and grating than expected, with red fruit, citrus, cherry sucking candy and graham cracker flavors. Finishes a bit edgy and candied, and overall it's generic with little personality.",Malbec
Argentina,"Candied and faux smelling, with a thin red-fruit palate that's sweet and generic. Fresh feeling due to high acidity but otherwise dull in taste and short on substance, flavor and concentration.",Malbec
Argentina,"Amid innocuous aromas of apple and green banana there's a whiff of dust on a hot radiator. The palate is wet, dilute and lacking in structure, while the flavors of pineapple and mealy apple vie with green notes akin to herbs and lettuce.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Smells like old peaches and tastes a bit like tangy tangerine and grapefruit. It's pithy, lumbering and fails to show any purpose, clarity or crispness. Too strange to recommend, but not undrinkable.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smells oxidized, as if it's dying. The palate is bland in feel and the flavors suggest fermented orange juice. Not hideous but uninspired; shows only a modicum of citrus character and pulse.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"A strange, light-bodied wine with aromas of animal cracker cookies, tangy raspberry and herbal weediness. The palate is weak in structure, with light-framed, herbal red-fruit flavors and a dash of pepper.",Merlot
Argentina,"Smells brambly, sour and muddy, and that's a fair indicator of what's to come. The palate is astringent and seemingly acidified, and the wine's core plum and berry flavors are weedy and murky. Not very appealing.",Malbec
Argentina,"Yellow in color, with oxidized aromas along with a hint of lemon and butterscotch. The palate is heavy while the flavors are bland and suggest bitterness. Does not show this grape in a very positive light.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Murky, stewy, soupy aromas deliver little to no freshness or fruit, while the palate is tannic and tastes bitter, mildly weedy and minty. Seems roasted and devoid of quality. Unclean and unimpressive.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Shows barely any color and then a hard, vapid, no-fruit bouquet. The mouthfeel is citric and the tastes range from lemon to lemon. Pithy, tart and frankly it's a barely drinkable rendition of Argentina's signature white grape.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Smells like corn stalks and also of oxidation. The palate is wet but shapeless, and the flavors are waxy and jumbled. It's yet another pass-it-by, underperforming Mendoza Chardonnay.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Big, chunky and dark on the bouquet, but not overly fruity and definitely not sweet and raisiny smelling. The palate on this four-grape, Malbec-led blend is robust and forward in acidity, thus the fruit flavors run fast and fresh, with a toasty, lively finish. Juicy, tight and doesn't wobble. Structured.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Big, stacked, deep and dark Malbec. The nose is rich, spicy and black in character, while the palate is bulky and shows generous blackberry, dark plum and chocolate flavors. Holds steady on the finish as it delivers muscle as well as some complexity. Well-made wine for the money.",Malbec
Argentina,"Ripe, fruity and jammy on the nose, with smokiness and earth to go with standard berry aromas. The palate leans towards full and jammy, with sweet berry and mild spice flavors. Chunky and full-bodied, but for the most part it gets things right.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Fiery stuff with aromas that suggest cheese and leather. The mouth has a forward feel and then leafy, herbal berry flavors with sides of compost and leather. Lightly herbal on the finish, and while it's big, sweet and chunky, it doesn't click to the maximum.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smoky and leathery on the nose, with earthy blackberry aromas, tobacco and tree bark aromas. The palate runs sort of heavy, tannic and raw, with grapey flavors of black currant and roasted plum. A chunky, earthy, roasted style of Cab to drink now.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Full and warm aromas of bacon, moss and black fruits set up a round, solid palate with dark plum, berry, herb and olive flavors. Finishes more dry and savory than jammy and fruity, with a final dose of herbs.",Merlot
Argentina,"White fruit aromas are as expected and clean, with no faux oak, weight or interference. The palate is round but nicely acidic, with cutting texture and sweet, lightly creamy flavors of sweet peach, apple and butter. Turns slightly oaky late, with butterscotch and spice.",Chardonnay
Argentina,Red in color and flat in terms of bubbles and mouthfeel. It smells and tastes burnt and bitter. This is an odd conconction made from Malbec that's barely acceptable.,Malbec
Argentina,"Attractive, somewhat unusual floral/violet aromas are in the lead, with blueberry, cassis and pastry sitting behind that. The palate is smooth yet lively, with flavors of wild berry, black currant, cola, chocolate and even bacon from the French oak. Tasty, balanced and interesting; 60% Malbec and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Concentrated for a value-priced Malbec, with aromas of blueberry, beets and cherry. The palate is full and moderately deep, with standard black fruit flavors along with hints of butter and vanilla. Structured and balanced, with creaminess.",Malbec
Argentina,"A little hot and fiery on the nose, with jammy raspberry and pepper aromas. The palate is thick, soft and full, with savory, hickory-influenced flavors of bacon and wild berry. Big and warm on the finish; nice overall.",Bonarda
Argentina,"A unique northern Argentinean blend made from Malbec, Cabernet, Bonarda and Tannat. It's wide-bodied, with a lot of tannin and stewiness. In between, there's tobacco aromas and flavors along with tomato, roasted berry, pastiness and rootiness. A deep, tannic load that requires grilled meat or cheese.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Dry oak, pepper and wood resin are prominent on the bouquet, which also brings minty black fruit scents and finally a pinch of sawdust. The palate is boosted by firm acids and tannins, while the flavors of baked berry and black plum are driving. A lot of oak and bite here, but also plenty of dark fruit.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Opaque blackish-purple in color, with the wine's typical dense, earthy, mossy aromas. Ripe as they come, with developed blackberry flavors, texture and grabby tannins. Finishes with richness and chocolate. Weighty, high-volume wine with a ton of body but not much elegance.",Malbec
Argentina,"The nose offers berry and black plum aromas that come across clean and proper. The palate is lush, juicy and good in feel, with thicker, more ripe flavors of warm plum and blackberry. Reaches almost dessert-level sweetness on the finish, cementing its status as a rich and ripe Malbec with moderate structure.",Malbec
Argentina,"Black and charred at first, with licorice, asphalt and a touch of bacon on the bouquet. The palate is soft, soupy and round, with ripe, saturated berry and fig flavors. Finishes spicy and full, with chewy tannins and ample extract.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fresh, layered aromas of black fruits and licorice are appealing. The palate is full and offers kick, while flavors of berry and plum are fairly rich, spicy and honest for $9 Cabernet. A bit sticky and it falls off on the finish, but overall it's a nice value red.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Sweet black plum, licorice and anise aromas are soft yet nice. The palate, however, is more clacky, with jammy, reduced flavors of syrupy berry and sappy tannins. Jammy and saturated on the finish as well; tons of berry and size, but not perfectly balanced.",Malbec
Argentina,"Light and airy to start, with peach and other white fruit aromas. The palate has good feel and lift along with nectarine, melon and mango flavors. Blends tropicality along with creaminess and crispness. Nice for the variety.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Jammy berry and plum aromas offer vanilla on the side. The palate is juicy, fresh and full, while the flavors suggest roasted berry, a light leafy quality and herbs. Healthy, stout and peppery/spicy on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Bold and earthy wine, with aromas of fine rubber, balsam wood, forest floor, spice and ripe black fruit. It's thick as it rolls over the palate, and the wild berry, herb and pepper flavors fit the wine's physique and profile. Long and fairly deep on the finish; drink now through 2011.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dusty, big and leathery on the nose, with coconut and earthy berry fruit aromas. The palate on this Cabernet-led blend is lively and juicy, with staunch acids and savory, earthy flavors of cherry and raspberry along with spice. Oaky and a little heavy, but offset by snappy acidity.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Dark, smoky and minty on the nose, with mocha and licorice in the backdrop. The palate is fleshy and full but also oaky and lactic, with creamy flavors of chocolate, syrupy berry fruit and vanilla. Finishes with salty notes, which go against most of the wine's creamy, oaky influences. One-third each of Cabernet, Malbec and Merlot.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Opens with earthy, leafy aromas that can best be described as “mature.” Throw in tobacco and baked plum, and the picture is complete. The palate is concentrated and tight, with sweet, herbal berry flavors and caramel on the finish. Rugged and herbal as a whole but with good qualities; 50% Cabernet with 40% Merlot and 10% Malbec.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"With a nice opening of plum, black cherry, floral notes and mocha, this captures the essence of quality Mendoza Malbec. The palate is generous and round, if a bit warm, and the flavors of blackberry, prune, spice and coffee are what we want from this type of wine. Drink throughout the winter and into 2010.",Malbec
Argentina,"An elevated, higher-quality style of Patagonian Pinot Noir. Verum has ripe, agile fruit aromas accented by bacon and vanilla from the barrel, while the balanced palate houses plucky cherry and raspberry flavors. Dry and spicy late, with delicacy. Drink now through 2011.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"As per usual, Toso's regular varietal Malbec is pleasing, honest and shows the variety in its best, affordable form. Meaty and rich on the nose, with an inky accent. The palate has the right feel and solid flavors of blackberry and raspberry. Competently covers the spectrum of aromas, feel and flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fully roasted, leathery and meaty on the nose, but there's also coffee, mocha and late-coming berry fruit. The palate is saturated, oily and pure, with a good mouthfeel and flavors of dark berry fruit and chocolate. Toasty and lightly burnt on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Spicy, hard aromas blend with pasty black fruit scents. The palate is big and lively, with baked flavors of blackberry and dark plum. Turns tight on the finish, which is crisp and tannic. Good Bonarda and a food-friendly wine.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Starts out with some heaviness and aromas of fresh cement and lacquer. With airing it improves, revealing a high-acid, fresh palate with raspberry, saline and herbal flavors. Roasted and firm on the finish, with a bit of excess heat.",Malbec
Argentina,"Roasted at first, with smoked ham and bacon aromas along with clove and other hard spice notes. The palate is oaky, with chewy tannins and a thick texture; flavors of blackberry are meaty and rich, while clove and more dry spices reappear on the finish. A different breed for Mendoza.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Perfumed, floral aromas lead to a juicy, slightly lean palate with berry and plum flavors. Plump and sturdy, with lifting acids and a secure body. Nothing spectacular but at least it's not heavy and grinding like Bonarda can be.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Coconut is apparent on the bouquet along with thick blackberry aromas. The palate is big and saturated but also simple and bulky. Flavors of baked blackberry are candied, while the finish is figgy and chubby.",Malbec
Argentina,"With a nutty nose of popcorn, baked apple and almonds, this is a classy wine that avoids the all-too-frequent dead weight that mars the majority of Argentina's white wines, especially Chardonnay. Juicy and tastes of pineapple, mango, banana and vanilla. Not mealy or chunky; handles its oak and warm-weather pedigree well.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Extravagantly floral on the nose, with blueberry, mineral and other particular aromas. But once you hit the palate, the acidity is extreme and thus the mouthfeel is sheering. Flavors of blueberry and mulberry are tangy, while the finish is angular. Too sharp and tangy to compete with the best, including Altamira and Bella Vista, Achaval-Ferrer's other single-vineyard big boys.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cherry, sweet berry and citrus peel aromas come in front of a full, slightly oaky palate with sweet plum and berry flavors. There's some length to the finish and more flavors of sweet, creamy but nicely applied oak.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Earthy and a bit foresty on the nose, with a leather accent to the berry aromas. Full and reasonably sound across the palate, which offers baked berry and coffee flavors in front of a modest, leathery finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Spicy dark fruit aromas include notes of tobacco and mint along with mustard and/or horseradish. The palate is big and tannic, with a rough feel showcasing round, chunky berry and cassis flavors. Stays rough and tannic on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Solid, familiar berry and plum aromas carry some sweetness and vanilla. The palate, however, is fairly acidic and tight, with a piercing center and snappy, almost tart flavors of raspberry and red plum. Crisp and sheering on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cherry and mild leather aromas are inviting, while the medium-bodied palate, despite having some bite and edge, is topped off with cassis, cherry and light medicinal flavors. A bright wine with lively acidity and touches of oak, butter and vanilla on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Exotic smelling, with Middle Eastern spice aromas, blueberry and herbs. Highly acidic and spiky in the mouth, with cassis and blackberry flavors in front of an aggressive finish that smolders with heat. Dense but awkward, with forceful acidity.",Petit Verdot
Argentina,"Tight, dark aromas of tar, leather and meat outmuscle the semi-herbal berry scents that come later. The palate is full, structured and grabby, with prune, black licorice and pepper flavors. A ripe, full-bodied wine with a chunky finish. Good Malbec with 15% Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah mixed in.",Malbec
Argentina,"An approachable, friendly Bonarda that avoids the grape's hard, tannic, rubbery tendencies. Blackberry, mint and toast aromas go straight to a full-bodied but tame palate of ripe black fruit and coffee. Drinkable straight out; a good one for barbecue and burgers.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Fully roasted and savory in its aromas, with rubber and a peanutty hardness to the bouquet. Full and forward in the mouth, with a round body and a glaring streak of sharp acids running through the palate. Plum, berry and leather flavors are good, while the finish is peppy and zesty.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tropical aromas of lychee and melon are bright but a little oily. The palate is round and honest in feel and acidity, with pineapple, lemon, tangerine and lychee flavors. Sweet and spunky on the finish; drink immediately.",Torrontés
Argentina,"A bit warm and baked on the nose, with aromas of fruit cake and pastry. The palate is full-bodied and chewy, with ripe, sweet black fruit flavors that finish with vanilla and chocolate.",Malbec-Tempranillo
Argentina,"Seems like quality and character are slipping a bit on this Malbec, which a few years ago overdelivered but is now more average. Red licorice, strawberry and sweetness characterize the nose. The palate is sweet and generic, while the finish is pretty much the same. Perfectly good but not the gem it used to be.",Malbec
Argentina,"A thick, dark and slightly raisiny nose features licorice and smoke. It's a full, beefy Malbec with herbal berry flavors and a finish that sweetens up like syrup but also gets more herbal. Powerful but more rustic than polished.",Malbec
Argentina,"Blackberry and other sweet aromas lead to a soft, mildly oaky palate with sweet, ripe plum and berry flavors. There's juicy acids and reasonable amounts of toast, licorice and spice on the finish. Not sure what differentiates this from Reserve, but the Barrel Select seems better balanced.",Merlot
Argentina,"Ripe and clean smelling, with berry fruit aromas and a pinch of spice. The palate is medium-bodied and just dense enough, with dark, slightly roasted flavors of blackberry and plum. Fresh and tight; covers the basics.",Malbec
Argentina,"Chunky, broad and slightly rubbery smelling, with baked aromas, leather and other more serious scents. The palate is full-bodied and warm, but not all that complex. Flavors of baked plums, cassis and licorice are nice, and the finish brings chocolate brownie into the game. For immediate drinking.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Raspberry and plum aromas bring a mild leafy, leathery accent. The palate is saturated and grippy, with sweet brown sugar, raisin and chocolate flavors. Solid, warm and tasty, with baked berry, weight and sweetness to the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A bit fleshy and melony on the nose, and also flowery. The palate has a full feel despite present acids, and the apple and citrus palate is clean and slightly green. Shows all the basics on a sweet, soft frame.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Smells good, with berry- dominated aromas. The palate is solid but acidic at the core, with sharpness on the palate that creates a juicy, crisp set of raspberry and plum flavors. Flattens out on the finish, where moderate oak-based butter notes rise up.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Giant and black, with extracted but pruney aromas that are sweet and raisiny. The palate is chunky, with raisin, fig and black plum flavors. Sweet but falls flat on the finish; has its good qualities but frankly it's an overripe wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Given that the number of good Argentine PGs can be counted on one hand, this one distinguishes itself. The nose is a touch sweaty and prickly, but the fresh palate, sporty acidity and solid flavors of lime, tangerine and nectarine are nice. Drink now.",Pinot Gris
Argentina,"Bold berry, rubber and coffee aromas give this basic Malbec some style to work off. The palate has bounce and fullness, with ripe black cherry and cassis flavors. Comfortable mouthfeel and finishing notes help it meet its goal: true Malbec with no glaring flaws.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dusty, ripe and nice on the nose, with baked apple, yeast and an overall nose similar to what you'd expect from good sparkling wine from anywhere in the world. Flavors of cantaloupe and orange are sweet and clean, while the finish falls off from where things started. Drink now.",Champagne Blend
Argentina,"Warm and earthy smelling, with aromas of cassis, blackberry, tire rubber and char. The palate has a good feel and flow, while the flavors veer a little toward roasted plum and blackberry. Finishes with heft and a mild baked character. Ready to drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rubbery and warm on the nose, with earthy plum and blackberry aromas. The palate is full and bouncy, with appropriate plum, berry and cassis flavors. Nice for standard New World Cab, with fig, chocolate and no buttery, sloppy oak.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Meaty, herbal aromas are a bit rooty and mossy but with time they offer up berry fruit and spice. The palate is full and plump, and also a little hard and tannic, while the flavors suggest prune and cassis. Spicy and with good feel to the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Much better than prior vintages, when it was known as Finca El Portillo. The nose is jammy and shows black fruit aromas, while the palate is complete and full but juicy, with plum and black cherry flavors. Pepper and toast flavors infiltrate the finish.",Merlot
Argentina,"Raspberry, plum and subtle oak aromas lead to a snappy, crisp, high-acid palate with pie cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. There isn't much finish or extras here; basic and well cut.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"An intimidating wine in that it's dark, huge and heavy. The nose is a roasted mass of tar, rubber, smoke and baked berry fruit. It's thick and fleshy in the mouth, with flavors of cola, chocolate, blackberry and blueberry. Minty and warm late, and overall it's more about color and size than refinement.",Malbec
Argentina,"A bit dark, narrow and crusty on the nose, with oak-driven berry fruit aromas. The palate is chewy, broad and generally well balanced, with savory, semi-herbal flavors of berry and cassis. Creamy and savory on the finish, with a little more oak than the basic fruit deserves.",Malbec
Argentina,"Neutral on the nose except for some oak and floral notes. The palate is fleshy and a bit hollow in feel, with peach and sweet, almost sugary melon and pineapple flavors. Finishes like a melon ball, but at least the mouthfeel is good and not flabby.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Sweet berry aromas are a bit warm and herbal, while the palate has good feel and soft, earthy flavors of herbs and generic berry fruit. Light on the finish, with a slight leafy note. Has good mouthfeel and doesn't overdo it.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark, smoky aromas suggest prune, licorice, coconut and shoe polish. The palate is sharper than the color would indicate, while flavors of dark berry, licorice and plum vie with oak then bitterness. Pinched and tangy at points, but balanced by oaky softness. 65% Malbec with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Light and red in style, with food-friendly acidity and good overall balance and presence. Has sheer qualities and crisp fruit flavors, but it's not sour or too edgy. Smells like Pinot and tastes like it, too.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Light and airy, with almost neutral aromas except for some lemon. The palate is round and offers good acids that propel green apple and lime flavors. A basic wine with light aromatics and proper flavors.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Citrus blossom and tropical aromas are light and easy. The palate is melony and not too acidic, with standard Asian pear, lychee and citrus flavors. Lively on the finish, and solid overall for under $10.",Torrontés
Argentina,"A little savory on the nose, with medicinal red berry aromas. The palate is medium in intensity and regular in feel, with earthy, herbal flavors of cherry and raspberry. Shows a meaty hint on a short, average finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Syrupy smelling on first take, with bacon, rubber and herb aromas. The palate has a healthy, full feel and a mixed bag of not fully connected flavors including herbs, spice, dried fennel and sweet berry fruits. A somewhat odd tasting blend of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon and 45% Merlot.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
Argentina,"Reduced and limited up front, with grassy, sweet aromas of sweet plum and berry. The palate is big but muddled by soft, full-bodied flavors of beets, licorice and sweet fruits. Shows some green on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Brambly and leafy on the nose and palate, with tight acidity and reedy, peppery flavors that suggest foresty raspberry. The finish is equally peppery, herbal and leafy, but overall it's not green or unappealing. A natural wine in that it's unoaked.",Malbec
Argentina,"Concentrated on the nose, with plum, berry and aged cheddar cheese aromas. The palate is snappy and nicely balanced, with clean, basic raspberry and cherry flavors. Pleasant throughout; doesn't reach too far; tasty and correct.",Malbec
Argentina,"In the shrinking under-$10 category, this is a winner. It features solid cherry fruit with tinges of rhubarb, bramble and dry spice, while the palate is fresh, medium in size and tastes of raspberry, red plum and herbs. Simple and straight-shooting Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Light and lemony aromas blend into lychee scents, while the palate is textured and fairly full, with dry, melony flavors along with green fruit and lychee. Finishes full, with moderate intensity. A quaffing wine to drink now.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Earthy and spicy up front, with modest heat and floral aromas. There's not much structure or body here, but it's juicy and just tasty enough due to good candied berry and plum flavors. A regular but steady everyday Cab.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Floral and light on the nose, with lemon blossom and peach notes. The palate has a fresh feel courtesy of proper acidity, while the apple and pineapple flavors are nice. Finishes tropical, with good jump and bounce.",White Blend
Argentina,"Fairly ripe, full and attractive, with dark plum aromas. The palate has bounce, jump and a bit of acidic sharpness, while the plum and berry flavors are generic but good. Sweet on the finish; standard and healthy stuff.",Malbec
Argentina,"The bouquet is floral and lightly jammy, with berry aromas and a savory note or two. Turns a touch soupy and salty in the mouth, where the red fruit flavors thin out quickly. Finishes without much punch, but at least it's solid.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Tangerine and citrus aromas give the bouquet an orangey element, and there's a pinch of oak and tarragon in there as well. The palate has a mild, buttery texture and creamy flavors of peach and apple. Honeyed and creamy on the simple finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Fiery and clipped on the nose, but then it settles onto red fruits and candy notes. The palate shows good grip and a proper but basic feel, with generic red berry and currant flavors. Solid on the finish; good in a common way.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Black fruit aromas abound, but it's also sort of foresty and fern-influenced on the nose. Zingy in the mouth, with savory, almost salty flavors of wild berry and black cherry. Seems to move a little fast and rough, but with good ripeness and honest flavors.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Patagonian style floral and mild citrus aromas infiltrate the bouquet, with generic red-fruit scents coming on later. Bright, juicy and a little hot and fiery in the mouth, with wild berry flavors and a toasty, dark finish. Plenty ripe but not subtle.",Malbec
Argentina,"Starts out with leathery, cheesy aromas; soon those scents evolve into red fruit aromas and vanilla. The palate is a bit tannic and tight, with medicinal cherry, cassis and peppery flavors. Crisp and sheer as well on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"The focus here is on red fruits and zest more than richness and weight. The palate is snappy, with raspberry and red plum flavors along with vanilla shadings. Candied and just full enough on the finish, with mild herbal notes.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fresh and straightforward on the nose, with tropical fruit aromas. The palate is pulpy but good, with flavors of fruit punch and melon. Turns a little sweet and pithy on the finish, but holds it together. Perfectly good for the price.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Tight berry aromas lead the way, followed by a lively but aggressive palate with jammy, sweet, candied berry flavors. Turns a little syrupy and sweet on the finish, but overall it succeeds in a generic sort of way.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Dark, smoky and charred on the nose, with herbal black fruit sitting under that. Call it a saturated cheek-grabber with rubbery tannins and sweet flavors of plum and blackberry. Shows coffee and toast in front of herbal, salty finishing notes.",Malbec
Argentina,"Floral aromas are soft, while the flavors of lychee and pear are sweet. Full, round and a touch oily in feel, this is more in the weighty, peachy style of the grape. Good but drink now, chilled.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Dark and rubbery on the nose, with a slight pickle-and-olive accent but mostly black fruit aromas. Juicy and also stout in terms of feel, with blackberry and herbal flavors. Finishes with a touch of buttery oak, chocolate and toast.",Merlot
Argentina,"Rubbery and roasted on first impression, with jammy berry aromas coming out later. The palate runs soft to the point of almost being mushy, while it tastes of baked black plum, fig and grape juice. Soft all around, with just enough vitality.",Malbec
Argentina,"A bit stalky on the nose, with tropical aromas and lychee. The palate is a little broken down and heavy, with flat citrus and lychee flavors. Finishes wan, with dried apricot notes.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Medicinal black cherry aromas turn heavier and more prune-like with air. The palate is reasonably solid and healthy in feel, but monotonous and devoid of layering. Tastes tangy, zesty and mostly clean, with slightly baked flavors and a spot of heat.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Full, warm and rubbery on the nose, and then chewy and round in the mouth. Flavors of plum and baked berry hint at tomato and a full and varied herb basket, while the finish is soft and slightly baked. Good Malbec but slightly heavy.",Malbec
Argentina,"A different type of Mendoza Malbec, with exotic, floral aromas and graham cracker sweetness. The palate is fresh but short on structure, while the flavor profile deals blackberry, herbal notes and bramble bush. Finishes a bit hard with no deviation from the palate",Malbec
Argentina,"Sweet and light smelling, with sugar cookie and blueberry aromas. The palate is medium in weight, with snappy acids and dry, lightly herbal flavors of raspberry and red plum. Mostly fresh on the finish, but with little volume or follow through.",Malbec
Argentina,"Earthy aromas suggest red cabbage and olive more than bright, ripe berry. The palate is chunky and clampy, with jammy, overly broad black fruit flavors that finish on the stewed and herbal side. Concentrated, massive and clumsy.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Opens with gumball aromas and also foresty spice and bramble. The palate is tight and tannic as it delivers standard red licorice, berry and leathery flavors. Finishes with some salty leather and that's about it.",Malbec
Argentina,"For a $5 wine, it offers pretty good red berry aromas along with a decent mouthfeel and proper acidity. The palate pops with red plum and raspberry flavors along with mild stalky, brambly notes that are more in the background than up front. Not overwhelming but doesn't disappoint.",Malbec-Bonarda
Argentina,"Heavily roasted and charred on the nose, with elements of roasted nuts and tire rubber. The palate is full and chunky, but with spiky acids that illuminate a salty character on the otherwise berry flavor profile. Finishes heavy and baked.",Malbec
Argentina,"Light and rusty in color, with lean aromas of baked fruits and maple. The palate is tight and spicy, with baked fruit and plenty of dry oak. Potent, hot and spicy on the finish.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Weighty and a little damp smelling. Reflects its warm central Mendoza origins via herbal, chunky flavors of olive and leafy berry fruits. Dries out quickly, leaving earthy bacon flavors and slight bitterness.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Fiery berry aromas come across sort of rough and scratchy. The palate is softer and more creamy, with vanilla, berry and pepper flavors. Finishes toasty and peppery, albeit slightly bitter.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Mulchy on the nose, with compost, leather and purple fruit notes. There's decent body to the wine but the flavors are stalky and green, with burnt, stemmy leftovers on the finish. A blend of 60% Malbec and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Opens with heat and brambly, scratchy aromas of black cherry. The palate is round if a bit sticky, with sweet, candied berry flavors. Round, sticky and sweet as well on the finish, with vanilla notes.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Jammy and savory on the nose, and not entirely familiar smelling. The palate has a clacky, narrow feel and then zesty, almost salty flavors mixed with semisour berry fruit notes. Peristent, but also not delivering enough fruit and sweetness to match the wine's salty, savory element.",Malbec
Argentina,"Basic raspberry and strawberry aromas lead to a crisp, zesty palate with limited but juicy flavors of strawberry mixed with rhubarb. Light and quick on the finish, with freshness but not much length or body.",Malbec
Argentina,"Foxy initial aromas settle on wild berry, licorice and shoe polish. This is a big, extracted, untamed wine with a grapey mouthfeel and dark, peppery, underdeveloped berry flavors. Narrows down on the finish, which ends mildly salty and bitter.",Malbec
Argentina,"Full and robust, but also brambly and a touch green and minty on the nose. The palate is thick, creamy and rough, with herbal berry and dry oak flavors. Finishes herbal and chocolaty.",Bonarda
Argentina,"A bit heavy and jammy on the nose. The palate is more pointed and acidic, with flavors of roasted berry, herbal plum and spice. Turns more juicy and acid-driven as it opens, and then finishes herbal, spicy and grabby.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Hard, earthy aromas are o.k., while the palate has a tough, clipped mouthfeel along with snappy, narrow raspberry flavors. Shows pop, heat, pepper and mild bitterness on the finish. Standard and simple; 40% Malbec with 30% each Merlot and Cab Sauvignon.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Vanilla and Animal Cracker aromas fold in mango and banana. The palate is soft and creamy, with not much acidity and pulpy flavors of ripe banana and pithy citrus. Soft and peachy on the finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Fiery, spicy, herbal black fruit aromas set up a tight, herbal palate with oak in support. Flavors are sweet and also creamy due to ample oak, while the finish is light in fruit, with a tomato accent.",Malbec
Argentina,"Candied blueberry and syrupy aromas jump from the glass. The palate, however, is tangy and underdeveloped, with herbal, sharp flavors of boysenberry and black raspberry. Not a lot to the finish other than heat and licorice.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rich, oaky and earthy, with char to the bouquet. A little tannic and beefy, but with serious grip and feel. Tastes like savory, herb-infused berry and plum, while the finish is herbal, long and solid. Nice wine with an herbal streak and staunch tannins.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Earthy, meaty, rubbery and dark, with oily black fruit aromas. The palate has a fresh, acid-driven feel, while the flavors are dark and a touch burnt. Finishes slightly bitter, with a peppery bite. Good on its best day.",Syrah
Argentina,"Slightly baked and raisiny on the nose, with char and licorice aromas backing that up. The palate is more acidic than you'd expect, with an outsized zesty bite to go with snappy, herbal plum and cherry tomato flavors. Baked and warm on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Pointed, sharp aromas leave an angular bouquet. The rest of the wine is jumpy, furry and a bit funky, with pointed plum and raspberry flavors and then a toasty, oaky finish with bitterness, heat and leftover butter flavors.",Merlot
Argentina,"Best on the nose, which is floral as it mixes in big black fruit notes and coconut. The palate has a creamy, grabby feel and then confected flavors of carob, vanilla and baked berry. Finishes heavy and very sweet, i.e. syrupy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Oily and blowsy smelling, with almondy aromas and a pinch of citrus. The palate is heavy and chunky, with sweet, overripe flavors of pineapple and peach. Sweet and stalky on the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Stemmy and lightly green on the nose, with raspberry and plum filling in the blanks. The palate is a bit hollow and empty, with herbal plum and berry flavors. Not bad but it does shows stemminess and raspy qualities.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Leathery and pinched on the nose, with rubber, olive and berry aromas. The palate runs hard and snappy due to high acidity and spiky tannins, while the flavor profile deals herbal notes, olive and dark plum. Fades fast on the finish, leaving a salty residue.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Spicy and roasted on the nose, with little that's typical of Cabernet Sauvignon. Astringent like a rubber band across the palate, with roasted, earthy flavors that offer some sweetness but not much else.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Grapey and foxy, with green, minty aromas and a hollow center. The palate is bulky, heavy and tannic, while the flavors are strained and grapey. Sweet and incomplete; grapey but not in harmony.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Jammy and a bit scratchy on the nose, and also sort of dull and earthy. In the mouth, it's tangy and citrusy, bordering on sour tasting, with pie cherry, plum and light savory notes. Finishes red and juicy, but with a tomato accent.",Malbec
Argentina,"Grapey blackberry aromas come across foxy. The palate is wet and high in acidity, leaving a semisour flavor profile with only a few hints of sweetness around the edges. Drying, herbal and salty.",Malbec
Argentina,"Jumbled and stewy on the nose, with soupy berry fruit aromas and rubberband. The palate is choppy and heavy, with brambly flavors of roasted berry. Tastes more salty and soupy than bright and fresh.",Malbec
Argentina,"Soapy smelling and a touch dull to start with. The palate is wet but doesn't deliver much kick, while the flavor profile includes lettuce greens, peach and apple. Fleshy but bland on the finish; drink right away.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Red licorice candy and sweet red berry aromas lead to a narrow, prickly, semitart palate with sharp raspberry and strawberry flavors. Finishes quick, with the taste of red Twizzlers. Not much depth here, but decent for the price.",Merlot
Argentina,"Sort of prickly, wild, rubbery and inconsistent, but it's also endowed with interesting olive, cracked pepper, herb and briney notes to go along with intense, dark berry core flavors. Finishes mildly burnt and bitter, which Bonarda is prone to do.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Slightly bouncy, brambly and foxy, with bubblegum and red-fruit aromas. The palate is sweet, friendly and plump, with a pretty good mouthfeel and candied berry flavors in the lead. Young and sticky on the finish; sweet and lively as a whole.",Malbec
Argentina,"Shows some nice qualities such as barrel notes of popcorn and buttered toast, but overall the wine is too soft and tropical to rate higher. The palate is plump, fruity and flush, but also low in acid and soft. Flavorwise, it's pure tropical fruit with a hollow finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Small-production (300 cases total) SB from high-elevation vineyards with solid apple and citrus aromas. Basic but clean, with lemon, orange, grapefruit and nectarine flavors. Good for Argentina, which doesn't have much of a track record with Sauvignon Blanc. Drink now.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"A simple but reasonably good white wine. Applesauce and citrus aromas are fruity and clean, while the mango-orange palate is tasty, a little sweet and citric. Pithy on the finish but mellow overall.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Tobacco and mint aromas cloud the wine's bouquet, while the palate starts out rough and scratchy, with a heavy dose of grape-skin tannin. Upon airing it offers more berry fruit but also salty, leathery finishing flavors. And the tannins never really cease.",Malbec
Argentina,"Raspberry, plum and cherry aromas become more thin, cheesy and leathery with time. The palate is hard and narrow, with sheer flavors of generic raspberry and plum. Clacky and rough feeling on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Candied, dark and murky on the nose, then narrow, clampy and tannic in the mouth. Flavors are herbal, while the fruit content is sweet blackberry and black plum. Short and hollow on the finish, which leaves a grapey residue.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Earthy and leafy aromas yield to tomato leaf and weighty plum aromas. The palate is full but sharp, with tart, driving pie cherry and herbal flavors. Stays rather hard on the finish, where more tomato rolls out.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Quite herbal and foxy on the nose, with char and olive aromas. The palate is thick, jammy and clumsy, with bittersweet notes of stewed berry and blackberry syrup. A huge, muscular wine that's really ripe and untamed.",Malbec
Argentina,"Heavily earthy and rubbery smelling, then big and bulky but out of whack on the palate. Tastes buttery and gummy, with generic berry fruit flavors that finish oaky.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Roasted, rubbery aromas fold in olive and asphalt. The palate has a decent feel and herbal flavors of olive and leafy, mulchy black fruits. Herbs and black olive flavors work the finish as well.",Malbec
Argentina,"Hard, dark and spicy up front, then clampy, tannic and aggressive feeling, with astringency and bitter, burnt, oaky flavors of black fruits. Finishes hard and tannic, with rubbery heat. A case of more being less; needs to be dialed down.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Awfully green and scratchy for a $30 “special edition” Malbec. The nose is brambly and rapidly devolves into outright grassy. The palate is narrow and underdeveloped, with reedy, raspy flavors of plum, raspberry and mint. Far from what you'd hope for from a higher-priced wine; 350 cases produced.",Malbec
Argentina,"This wine defines overripe but palatable Malbec. The nose is raisiny and heavy, but not very powerful. In the mouth, it runs soft and flat, with sweet, thick flavors of cola, raisin and baked out berry. Chunky and chewy on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"A particular and odd style of wine that frankly seems too far out of the norm. Blueberry, juniper, citrus peel and air freshener all appear on the scrappy bouquet, while the flavor profile is herbal, green, salty and strange. This is a new wine for the American market from Bodega Colomé, and it needs work.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Rosy pink and good for warm-climate getaways this winter. Bright, candied aromas are controlled and don't veer into bubblegum land, while the palate is medium soft and has just enough acid to prop up nectarine and citrus flavors. Won't last long but showing well in its early days.",Malbec
Argentina,"Unusual aromas of pine needle, cough drop and herbal berries set the stage for a juicy, tight palate with raspberry, red plum and herbal flavors. Medium in length and intensity, with a smooth finish that leaves a solid, generally positive lasting impression.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Youthful raspberry and strawberry aromas bring a little cotton candy as well, while the palate is round, a touch soft and shows bouncy berry and citrus flavors. Solid and tastes just about right, but a bit cloying toward the end.",Malbec
Argentina,"Ultra-purple in color, with shallow aromas of pine, thistle patch and black fruit. It's blazing with acidity, which pulls everything in tight and firm. And while that's happening, the blackberry flavors become drawn and borderline sour. Like many previous Achaval-Ferrer varietal Malbecs, this one has its issues.",Malbec
Argentina,"Slightly astringent on the nose, with floral berry and bramble aromas. The palate is tight and a little sharp, with fresh, almost tart raspberry and plum flavors. Cleansing on the finish due to high acidity. Seems more racy and less oaky than in the past.",Malbec
Argentina,"Kind of hard, pasty and candied on the nose, with a thick and chunky palate feel along with sweet, sugary, generic red fruit flavors. Hailing from Patagonia, this is a basic, creamy Cabernet with body and size but not too much character.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dark, full-throttle aromas of black cherry, candied plum and burnt something or other set up a straightforward, fairly full-bodied palate with mildly tart plum and cherry flavors. Basic; pretty good size and feel. More generic than varietal in overall character.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Respectable red fruit aromas carry a slight pickled sharpness and the scent of a matchstick, while the palate is lactic and creamy, with strawberry, raspberry, plum and herbal notes. Plump and reasonably well balanced, with an herbal finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"A sweet-styled Cabernet with raisin, black cherry and baked plum aromas. The feel is clacky and unsophisticated, and the flavors blend candied currant, prune and sugar. Grabby as well.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Candied and thin on the nose, and that's pretty much what follows. The palate is dilute, while the flavors of red fruits are crisp and semisour. Scratchy and tart on the finish as well.",Malbec
Argentina,"Nail polish and mulchy fruit don't do a lot to help the wine along. The palate is sweet, cloying and creamy, with milk chocolate flavors on top of simple plum and cherry. Sweet and a bar-worthy red at best.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Inky blueberry and boysenberry aromas shift to beet juice. The palate is hard, cheeky and tannic, with limited black fruit flavors, controlled sourness and herbal elements. Finishes chunky and not terribly flavorful, with tomato.",Malbec
Argentina,"Shows little on the nose, while the palate is bland and flat, with simple apple and lemon flavors. Soft and chunky white wine with some drab tropicality.",Torrontés
Argentina,"A dilute and scratchy wine that lacks the body and depth of good Cab. Frankly, it's sour, lean and tough, with tart plum and pie cherry flavors. Dry as a bone on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Smells like wet dog, with sweaty red fruit. The palate is high in acid and low in volume, with snappy, semisour flavors of raspberry and red plum. Settles on the finish but still it's sharp and lean. 80% Tempranillo and 20% Malbec.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Wild, edgy and hot on the nose, which breaks up fast. The palate is narrow, sweet and pruney; stewed up on the finish and grapey throughout.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Stalky and green smelling, with tobacco and stemmy fruit aromas. The palate is scratchy and stewy, with soupy flavors of tomato and raspberry. Herbal on the deficient finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Medicinal and feral on the nose, then heavy, thick and extremely creamy and soft in the mouth, with bland, flat flavors of milk, carob and vanilla. Short on fruit, acidity and purpose.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"Heavily vegetal and unclean on the nose, then pickled on the palate, as in sauerkraut. The only thing saving this from the flusher is decent body weight and mouthfeel.",Sémillon
Argentina,"Mute on the nose, but heavy in the mouth, with grapefruit and pickled flavors. Finishes pickled and pithy. Already old.",Torrontés
Argentina,"A rough, pinchy nose with leather and funk is no way to begin. The palate stays hard and spiky, with burnt, rustic, murky flavors. Roasted and mossy on the finish, and not very good overall.",Malbec
Argentina,"Ashy, green and funky smelling, then sweet, chunky and murky tasting. Nothing is meshing here. It's barely acceptable.",Sémillon
Argentina,"Creamy, sweet aromas of cola and cassis are more generic than compelling, while the palate is soft, creamy and sports flavors of mocha and syrupy dark fruit. Hints of marshmallow and root beer accent the wine's sweet berry DNA, while the finish is regular. Good but a little sweet and sticky.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Pretty decent for a Mendoza Pinot, but still challenging on the nose and in the mouth. Leafy, rhubarb notes blend with berry fruit aromas, while the snappy palate has some raspberry sharpness but isn't piercing or painful.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Tough cherry and plum aromas lead it off, followed by simple, semitart raspberry flavors. There's not much depth or complexity; the palate bounces along inoffensively, and the finish is quick and light. Clean and basic wine.",Syrah
Argentina,"An unusual specimen, especially on the nose, where spicecake, floral and incense aromas are atypical. The palate is kind of sharp and immature, with grapey, blueberry flavors and coconut on the finish. A different breed of Malbec, but not what we'd call a slam-bang success.",Malbec
Argentina,"A bit herbal and brambly, with baked, earthy red fruit aromas. Modest raspberry flavors are mostly what you get off the narrow palate, and the finish follows suit as it fades out with a tight, herbal character. Rudimentary Cabernet.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Light in color, with neutral semi-citric aromas that are clean but innocuous. Candied in the mouth, as if there's a bit of residual sugar in the wine. Flavors of sweet apples and citrus are more than acceptable, and as it winds down it comes to a modest, easygoing conclusion.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Opens with pleasant, semiexotic blueberry and herbal aromas. The palate is bright and snappy, with moderate weight and balance and then fairly bright red berry, vanilla and herbal notes. Forward, lean and simple Malbec. Gets the job done.",Malbec
Argentina,"Black cherry and cassis aromas are dark and a little sharp, while the palate smacks down hard with rubbery tannins and forward, sappy cherry and black plum fruit. Dark, tannic, tough and flavorful. As Bonarda goes, this is right in the middle of the field.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Snappy red berry aromas and some heat define the nose, while a lean, tight, acidic palate pushes forward with racy raspberry and cherry flavors. Clamps down on the finish, but always shows good zest and crispness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smells a bit too much like canned fruit and applesauce, while the palate is heavy, chunky and tastes of creamy, baked white fruits. Thick and decadent, with ample oak, vanilla and spice.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Sweetly fragrant, with hints of pear and melon. The palate is wet, lean and acidic, which helps push the lychee and melon flavors. A clean, light, mild refresher with sharper-than-expected acids. Nothing more than that.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Very impressive for a blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot. Starts with a rich, bacony nose that brings cassis and blackberry, while the palate is saturated, big and layered, with wild raspberry, chocolate and spice flavors. It touches all the bases while maintaining a rich, almost syrupy mouthfeel. Drink now through 2014.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Excellent value in top-flight Malbec. In the four years that we've rated this wine, it hasn't dropped below 90 points. This vintage, with its deep, smooth luscious nose and dark black fruit flavors mixed with spice and chocolate, is the best Piedra Negra to date. A pure, delicious Malbec to drink now and over the next four years.",Malbec
Argentina,"A purple monster with lovely aromatics of campfire, mint, blackberry and spice. Very deep in the mouth, but not overweight or even slightly out of balance. The flavors are robust and pure, with an emphasis on black fruit, cassis and chocolate. And the finish brings nuances of cardamom, nutmeg and peppercorn. By far Goulart's epic wine. Drink now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"Year after year this rosé fails to inspire. It's flat and already a bit spent, with creamy strawberry fruit and little vital acidity. Tastes o.k., doesn't offend, but won't last long.",Malbec
Argentina,"If you catch this wine soon, meaning before it goes belly up, you may like its peachy simplicity and ample palate weight. Lychee, melon and spiced-meat flavors are interesting up to a point, and the finish is generic, soft and clean. Drink immediately.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Low-volume wine with light, dry, red fruit aromas. Red plum and tomato flavors with a short, lean feel. Basic on the finish, but stays on course. Is what it is: light, generally fresh and short on fruit.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Hard, crusty aromas loosen a little with time, but then you get pool water and foxiness. The palate is rough and lean in fruit content, with lactic, caroby notes accenting herbal red-fruit flavors. Peppery late but also sweet and resiny in the end.",Shiraz
Argentina,"Exemplary and exotic in the same breath. Aromas of sandalwood, spiced blueberry compote and fine leather make for an awesome bouquet. The palate is structured and huge like any top-end Argentine Malbec, but there's purpose and elegance as well. Tastes of integrated oak, black fruits, subtle herbs and spice. Textured, deep and toasty on the finish. Drink now through 2015.",Malbec
Argentina,"It takes a few minutes to become friends with this bruising heavyweight from Mendoza's Uco Valley. It's muscular, tough, tannic and lemony now, but time will unleash a lovable, big-time Argentine blend with rustic notes along with pure, polished berry fruit and loads of earthy spice. Better to hold until at least 2011 before uncorking.",Red Blend
Argentina,"An intense Malbec-led marauder with rubbery black fruit aromas, spice and mile-deep ripeness. Pure, modern, beefy and purple, with rich black fruit flavors and also some sweeter blueberry notes. Finishes sizable but smooth. Drinkable now but better in a year. 70% Malbec with 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cab Franc.",Red Blend
Argentina,"The “oak” in the name is appropriate because this one is draped in unctuous, heavy, burnt aromas. The nose is a cloud of coconut, char and woody blackberry, while the syrupy palate is all sweet black plum, carob, mint and resin. Quite oaky and thick for a value-priced wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Scented candle, green herbs, mushroom and anonymous white fruit aromas lead to a cidery, fairly thin palate of melony flavors. Finishes plump but slightly pickled. Not bad for $7.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Opens with apple and buttercup aromas that are encouraging, but the palate falls off. It's wet but shows no definition or fruit. Creamy and generic in the mouth, and ultimately it doesn't go anywhere besides being plump and loaded with vanilla.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Opens with thin fruit and alcoholic burn, and while the wine is always hollow in its middle and basic, it does offer adequate plum, raspberry and peppery flavors. Toasty and bitter on the finish, with an o.k. mouthfeel.",Syrah
Argentina,"Citrus, lychee and a slight, briney, pickled quality define the nose. The palate has enough acidity to ensure a proper mouthfeel, although the flavors of white grapefruit and pear are basic at best. Finishes slight, bland and mildly bitter.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Different than past Chacayes wines in that it's more floral and exotic, and less about pure power. Aromas of blueberry, violets and graham cracker precede a well-built palate with wild berry and floral-infused flavors. Long, creamy and smooth on the finish. Drink now through 2014.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A dynamite Malbec with heavy oak and the structure and foundation to match it. Lemon, hickory, leather, marzipan and black fruit aromas are powerful. In the mouth, tannins and extract create a vise grip to frame concentrated blackberry, coconut, pepper and lemon peel flavors. Layered and woody on the finish. Drink from 2012 through 2016.",Malbec
Argentina,"Initial butterscotch, vanilla and baked apple aromas turn to burnt corn and flatness with time and air. The palate is zesty but has no recognizable Chardonnay traits; it's big, pithy and won't turn any heads.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Brambly, hot and rubbery fruit aromas lead to a palate of lean, herbal, strawberry flavors. Herbal and snappy on the finish, with decent structure and balance. Flavorwise it's on shaky ground.",Shiraz
Argentina,"Heavy and slightly vegetal smelling, with a flat feel and flavors of banana, pineapple and vanilla. Chunky, soft and bitter on the finish. Like tropical fruit juice; bears hardly any resemblance to textbook Chardonnay.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Tropical aromas of pineapple and banana are as good as it gets. The palate is lean, acidic and sour, with a distinct briney character. Surprisingly sour and pithy; acceptable but worse than the winery's basic Saurus Chardonnay.",Chardonnay
Argentina,Opens with slightly pickled apple and melon aromas. Next in line is an edgy palate of pickled apple and vinaigrette flavors. Very pithy and tasting of grapefruit late. Fairly heavy and aggressive for SB.,Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Dark, dense and minty on the bouquet, which is sexy and magnetic. Saturated and jammy but still maintaining balance, and then a superconcentrated set of jammy blackberry flavors runs side by side with toasty oak and chocolate. Almost dessert-like on the finish. A very rich and modern style of Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cola, mint, black fruit and chocolate combine to form the full package in Malbec aromatics. Runs a mile deep in the mouth, with concentration, tannic grip and ripe blackberry, dark plum and cassis flavors. Peppery and chocolaty on the finish, with density and depth. Drink now through 2015.",Malbec
Argentina,"Ripe and totally right, with an attractive aromatic combination of dark spice, lusty berry and blackness. Weighty but comfortable in the mouth, with a delicious mix of berry, cassis and smooth oak flavors. Shows grip and structure on the finish; impressive and generous. Drink now through 2014.",Malbec
Argentina,"The funky stable welcomes a new breed of llama: Pinot Grigio. And like most of the other FL wines, it's acceptable to o.k. but not showing much in the way of quality. The nose is mealy and flat, while the palate has roundness and soft flavors of orange, grapefruit and white pepper.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Reduction, iodine and matchstick aromas cloud up the bouquet, while the heavy palate is both sweet and sour. In the grand scheme of things, this wine just isn't very good. It smells and tastes nothing like quality Chardonnay.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Leafy and dull to start, with questionable freshness to the aromatics. More hard and tannic than you'd want, and herbal and tomatoey in the mouth. It even has a distinct salty, no-sugar finish. Where's the freshness?",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"In general we are big fans of Toso's value-priced reds, but not so much this sweet, pickled, soft rosé. Wet and wide, but with no spine. Already on a downward plane.",Malbec
Argentina,"Crusty, inky and minty smelling, with additional earth, leaves and alcohol. A hard, rubbery, pruney style of wine that is tough and unexpressive. Think rough Montepulciano from Italy.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Toasty oak aromas hint at something serious, but in the mouth it's a dud. Banana and resin flavors are all you get, and the mouthfeel is flat as a board. Overoaked and dull.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Aggressive lemon-lime aromas are itchy, and the nose turns grassy and green. Overactive in the mouth, and tough to hold on the palate. Just at the level of acceptable; warning signs have been posted.",Sparkling Blend
Argentina,"Candied, jammy aromas don't lead to much of anything. Grating, sour, weak stuff; tomato and bland plum flavors with sour acidity. Barely worth a splash.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A sniff is rewarded with sandalwood, dry spice and thick, jammy berry aromas. It's concentrated and well integrated on the palate, with ultraripe and sweet flavors of coconut, vanilla cream and berry fruit. Seems a touch flat and candied on the finish, with a final blast of sweetness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Graphite and lead pencil aromas mix with toasty berry scents. It's solid and textured in the mouth, with creamy oak flavors alongside sawdust, milk chocolate and sweet berry notes. Deep and solid on the finish, but it trails behind Adrianna wines from recent vintages.",Malbec
Argentina,"Complex and also ripe and blatantly pleasing. Balsamic aromas blend with cassis, blackberry and citrus peel secents to form an exotic bouquet. It's solid and firm in the mouth, with lemony oak framing pure berry fruit. Tight, pure and delivers the total package for Patagonian Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"A new wine from Norton named after the winery's Austrian owner, Gernot Langes, is a serious Bordeaux-style blend with creamy oak, vanilla, chocolate and espresso on the bouquet. It's deep, dark and full of cassis and berry flavors. All totaled, this is a prized offering that's textured and ripe. It has the right feel and the right stuff in general.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Dark and deep smelling, with cola, berry and earth tones. Overall this is a cool and collected wine; it's tight and structured, with firm tannins and attractive flavors of dark berry, coffee, chocolate and fine herbs. Toasty and still fairly oaky on the finish. Drink now through 2014.",Malbec
Argentina,"Calm, foresty, complex and inviting on the bouquet, with catchy berry and spice aromas. It's round, balanced and healthy in the mouth, with cola, dried herb, cassis and blackberry flavors. Chocolaty and oaky on the finish, but dry and proper. Almost identical to Qaramy's basic blend of Malbec, Cab and Syrah. Drink now.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A powerful wine offering a rush of berry and plum aromas offset by sandalwood and blueberry. Tight as a vise in the mouth, but not overly hard or tannic. Tastes of light herbs, chocolate and bright berry fruit, then turns toward complexity and tobacco on the finish. Drink now through 2014.",Malbec
Argentina,"Chocolate and charcoal aromas form a dark and masculine greeting. There's also coffee and an herbal note to the nose. Lush but not heavy, tannic or plodding, with powerful black fruit and herbal flavors. Runs deep and long on the finish; impressive.",Malbec
Argentina,"Deep berry, cola, mint and leather aromas are classy and not overdone. Feels lush and deep in the mouth, with blatant ripeness and toasty, oaky flavors of cola, coconut and blackberry. Finishes big but not that long or complex. Drink now through 2013; Malbec with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Smells ripe and friendly, sort of like a jelly doughnut. The palate is creamy, dense and balanced, with saturated berry and spice flavors. Very smooth and integrated overall, and while it's definitely dark and ripe it's also popping with freshness. A complete wine at every turn.",Malbec
Argentina,"Thick and sultry smelling, with aromas of menthol, mint, tobacco, leather and ripe black fruits. Feels good but oaky, with resiny tannins and baked berry and vanilla flavors. Dark, toasty and mellow on the finish. Shows ripeness, balance and lots of oak. Drink now through 2014.",Red Blend
Argentina,"After sinking the 2005 version of this wine for being discombobulated, this seems like a total turn-around. It's dense and jammy like the previous year, with similar toasted qualities. But it's also better balanced and mentally challenging, with flavors of black olive, baked berry fruit and earth. Finishes rich and oily, with a distinct coffee flavor. Drink now into 2010.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"For a sense of class, elevation and style that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, this blend of Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon is very much worth a go. It's versatile and stocky, but it's no fruit-only lug. That said, expect saturated berry flavors, herbal hints, baked notes and firm tannins. Masculine but approachable. Drink now through 2011.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"When people ask us, “What's your favorite value wine from Argentina,” the pet answer is this one, Pascual Toso. A former Best Buy of the year, the '07 keeps the streak of great values alive. It's round, balanced and loaded with holes-free berry and cassis aromas and flavors. It is also layered, long and composed.",Malbec
Argentina,"A big wine, but some persistent sulphur and earthiness on the nose results in aromas of leather, scrambled eggs and tobacco. Rugged on the palate, but that's to be expected for a big-boned Malbec like this. Flavors of blackberry and black cherry are supported by powerful oak, leather and an infusion of herbs. Drinkable now and best through 2010.",Malbec
Argentina,"Weinert has always pushed the more traditional, less extracted style. And this Bordeaux blend shows a nose of light spice, cinnamon, wet clay and subdued berry fruit. The palate is earthy, with hints of tomato, herbs, raspberry and cocoa. It's a drying wine, with grabby tannins, but it should age well for another few years. Drink now or hold through 2011.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Concentrated black fruit aromas are subtle and don't push real hard. It's jammy, deep and soft in the mouth, with sweet tannins and even sweeter core berry flavors and oak. Finishes smooth, with barrel influence and warmth. Very nice as always, but not as elevated and exact as prior vintages.",Malbec
Argentina,"Bold but also steady across the bouquet, with coconut, chocolate, mint and wild berry aromas. Forward and concentrated in the mouth, where ripe, generous black fruit flavors blend comfortably with chocolate and spice notes. Finishes with drive, mouthfeel and sly clove and nutmeg flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"Supersaturated, so much so that it's opaque, with blackberry, horseradish and chocolate aromas. In the mouth, it's on the cusp of overextraction but manages to toe the line. Flavors of roasted berry, coconut and bitter chocolate are dark and lead to a tannic finish. Drink now through 2014.",Malbec
Argentina,"Solid and broad on the nose, with black cherry, berry and controlled rubbery aromas. Fresh, juicy and healthy on the palate, with good drive and dark, toasty flavors of black fruits, spice and chocolate. Spicy, warm and a bit complex on the finish. Malbec with Cab Sauvignon and Syrah; drink now.",Red Blend
Argentina,"More clean and relaxed than Chalten's 2006 Gran Reserva, this reserve-level Malbec shows generous red-fruit aromas in front of standard but totally pleasant blackberry, spice and chocolate flavors. Nicely balanced, with firm acidity, mellow but present tannins, and a medium-long, slightly oaky finish. Classic Argentine Malbec from Neuquén in Patagonia.",Malbec
Argentina,"Black as they come, with saturated, jammy aromas of sweet berry fruit, blackberry syrup and toasty oak. The palate is lush and chewy, with black fruit, spice and herbal flavors. Toasty and black on the finish. A big wine with plentiful oak as well as purity.",Malbec
Argentina,"Bulky and dark up front, with coconut, ripe berry and heat on the nose. Feels rich and resiny, with sticky tannins, extract galore and flavors of coconut, wood grain, black licorice and sweet blackberry. Finishes hefty and grabby, with wayward oak that needs to settle in.",Malbec
Argentina,"Like most Tikal wines, this is beefy and saturated, with grapy, creamy, dark fruit aromas. Feels tight and lush in the mouth, with a meaty structure and dense flavors of blackberry and herbs. Turns more herbal as it unwinds before finishing toasty and thick.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sweet on the bouquet, with aromas of coffee, mocha, berry jam and cherry extract. Broad and saturated on the palate, with ripe blackberry, cassis and chocolaty flavors. Finishes smooth and easy, with ripe tannins. Very nice but ordinary as full-bodied, extracted Malbecs go.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tiza is a very good Malbec with ripe, minty, lush aromas that lead straight to juicy black plum and blackberry flavors. It's intense and powerful, but shows good balance, generosity and proper but strong oak. Expect plenty of kick, power and darkness from this wine. Drink throughout 2009 and into 2010.",Malbec
Argentina,"A touch saucy on the nose, with tomato and herbal aromas infiltrating baked berry fruit scents. Feels fresh and clacky, with less extract and body than in the past but also more elegance. Tastes snappy and mildly herbal, with a juicy, slightly lean finish. Food friendly; drink now through 2013.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Nice, full and smooth up front, with minty blackberry aromas that fold in bacon and smoky oak. Pure and showing good body along with chocolaty notes and core flavors of berry and cola touched up by barrel spice. Turns richer and more sweet as it breathes.",Malbec
Argentina,"Earthy on first impression, then more vital and modern, with raspberry and plum aromas along with a dose of oak. Full and showing a powerful grip in the mouth, with cassis, black cherry and chocolate flavors. Sweet and very ripe late, with a touch of raisin as it fades away.",Cabernet Franc
Argentina,"By Nicasia's high previous standards, this wine from a substandard vintage is lacking. After an opening of sweet berry aromas, cured meat and spice, it's very sweet and candied tasting, with milk chocolate and carob flavors along with unabsorbed oak. Has an easy flow and soft tannins but doesn't have the precision, depth, crispness and totality of the 2005, '06 or '07.",Malbec
Argentina,"A touch reedy and rooty on the nose, but it settles to offer plum and berry aromas and complexity. Feels saturated and jammy in the mouth, with sweet, powerful berry flavors that show candied sweetness and herbal accents. Sweet on the finish as well, with caramel and toffee flavors. Superripe and intense. 250 cases made; drink now through 2014.",Malbec
Argentina,"This new Pinot from Laura Catena's Luca label is fresh, honest and peppy. The nose is lightweight, airy and a little earthy, while the palate is fresh and agile, with good acidity and nice raspberry and pie cherry flavors. Shows some oak, vanilla and spice on a dry, mild finish. Definitely on the right path.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Nice and ripe, with cassis, blackberry and some oaky softness up front. The palate is convincing and properly textured, and it deals tasty cassis and plum-like flavors. Across the board this wine is comfortable and comforting; it finishes short but composed, with honest Malbec color, feel and flavor components.",Malbec
Argentina,"This wine purports to cause whiplash, supposedly because it's so good, hence the “HeadSnapper” name. And while that's not likely to take place, its blackberry, toast and brambly undercurrent give it character, while the finish is cushioned and long, albeit a touch oaky. Healthy and very much worth a look, even if it won't cause your head to snap.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rubbery smelling at first, then earthy cherry and stewed fruit aromas emerge. Juicy and a bit pointed in terms of acidity, so it shocks the palate and pierces the cheeks. Tastes pulsing and ripe, with big red fruit flavors, candied sweetness, coconut and chocolate.",Cabernet Franc
Argentina,"Smoke, rubber and spice aromas mix with ripe berry scents to form a solid and impressive bouquet. It's thick and saturated but balanced, with harmonious, easy to like flavors of blackberry and cassis. Long and solid on the finish; captures the essence of value-priced Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with a blast of milk chocolate, raisin and sawdust before settling on black fruit and pepper. Shows good concentration and feel in front of prune, blackberry, licorice and burnt toast flavors. Has good pulse and vibrancy, but it's a bit choppy and oaky.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big and woody to start, with heavily toasted blackberry and herbal aromas. The palate is thick, dense and tannic, but it doesn't punish. Tastes of cassis, blackberry and herbs before transitioning to dry oak and roasted berry on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Lemon peel, wet clay, sandalwood and nutmeg aromas are inviting. In the mouth, it's tight and tannic, but lively, with leather and roasted berry flavors. Finishes firm, tight and a bit clipped and choppy. A reflection of 2008's tough conditions.",Malbec
Argentina,"Meaty, herbal and foresty on the nose, all of which are typical aromas for this Salta-bred Malbec. Linear in the mouth and acidic as it tastes exotic due to herbal notes and eucalyptus. On the other hand it's full of blackberry and chocolaty richness. Crisp and nicely built on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big and boisterous on the nose, with ripe plum, berry, smoke and meaty aromas. Mouthfilling and edgy feeling, with bold berry and plum flavors that feature an herbal, peppery aftertaste. Earthy and herbal leaning on the lengthy finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Given that Argentina is hardly SB country, this wine sticks out for its clarity, minerality and freshness. The nose offers lean lime and other citrus aromas. That's followed by a juicy palate with lime, passion fruit and tangerine flavors. Tropical but also citric, with cutting acidity.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Opaque and thick, with all types of black fruit aromas blending with smoked meat scents and toasty darkness. The body is fleshy and extracted, with raw tannins and a clacky feel. Tastes woody and baked, with blackberry, licorice and sweet plum flavors. Turns herbal and minty on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Sweet and easygoing from the start, with candied berry and floral aromas. The palate sits at maximum ripeness, meaning it's sweet and soft but still holds its balance. Flavors of baked berry and brown sugar are generous and smooth, while the finish is mellow and lush.",Malbec
Argentina,"Floral red fruit aromas settle on raspberry and plum, and there's not much obvious oak or darkness. Round and juicy on the palate, with spicy and sweet blackberry along with clove. Integrated and solid, with a lightly toasted, chocolaty finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"On the bouquet it leans toward ripe and heady but there's also a strong herbal and tomato element that creates a green element. Feels full but choppy and tannic, with berry, tomato and spice flavors. Feels warm on the finish, with herbal shadings. Drink now; Malbec with Cab Sauvignon, Merlot, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Tropical aromas blend nicely with honey, peach and fresh-cut hay notes. The palate is focused and properly acidic, with lemon, green apple, vanilla and toasty flavors. Perfectly fresh and easy on the finish, with good citric carry through.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A ripe, modern success with everything a fan of New World reds might want. The nose is floral and beautiful, with fine oak scents supporting brilliant raspberry, plum and spice aromas. It's deep, smooth and pressing in the mouth, with a delicious set of blackberry, coconut, vanilla and creamy flavors. A beauty to drink now through 2017.",Red Blend
Argentina,"As far as Argentine Syrah goes, this vintage of Iscay, which contains 3% Viognier in a nod to France, is the new benchmark for the country. Daniel Pi and Joey Tensley's wine discloses aromas of jammy berry fruits along with cardamom and floral notes. The palate is a fortress of layers, while flavors of blackberry, cassis and chocolate set the stage for finishing notes of vanilla, butter, espresso and cocoa powder. Drink through 2018.",Syrah-Viognier
Argentina,"Quite toasty and black, with baked plum, berry and crusty, oaky aromas. The palate is sort of soft and lazy, but amid the thickness there's roasted plum and black cherry flavors. Finishes with some wayward buttery oak, heat and coffee notes. Chewy, ripe and a bit grabby and heavy.",Malbec
Argentina,"A mature, restrained wine with earth, leather, red pepper flake and dry fruit on the nose. The palate is roasted and a touch acidic, but because of that you'll never perceive it as fat and lazy. Finishes with some baked brown sugar, leather and tannic grab. A good food wine. Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Merlot.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Always a good buy and always big and husky, Gascón is a saturated and dark wine but one with good balance and texture. The nose features cola, boysenberry and density, while the palate is sweet and floral, with big berry flavors. Quite good for a fat young Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Concentrated and jammy smelling, with a note of iodine to go with racy black fruit aromas. Dense as night in the mouth, with gamey, roasted berry flavors. Turns minty on the finish, with a hint of herbal green. Fruity and nice but lacks that final gear.",Malbec
Argentina,"Stocky, smoky and well composed on the nose, with aromas of blackberry and hickory leading the charge. Shows pulse and concentration on the palate as toasty oak, chocolate and chewiness blend nicely with black fruit and cassis flavors. Firm, deep and tannic on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"One sniff tells you plenty: there's attractive spice, coffee and leather to go with rich molasses and broad black-fruit aromas. The palate maintains balance due to fine, fresh acidity, and the flavor profile brings mocha, coffee, berry, plum and toast. Delicious, deep, layered and refined. Will age for at least 5–6 years, but best from 2012–2014.",Malbec
Argentina,"With an opaque purple tint and super-concentrated aromas of blackberry and violet petals, this is an in-your-face Malbec that pulls no punches. The “Enemy,” which is really your friend, pushes blackberry, licorice, chocolate and floral flavors on a frame that expands as it airs out. Drink now through 2019.",Malbec
Argentina,"Nice enough but not all that varietal in terms of aromas, flavors or anything. There's big red and black fruit aromas and flavors along with firm tannins, extract and some pepper. It's rich and chewy, but also tannic and fairly regular. For the price it should not disappoint.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Needs some time to unwind but once it does it mixes bold, dark berry fruit with earth and chocolate. There's not a lot of layering, variety or nuance to this wine. It's a straightforward, global red. Expect for it to be solid, tasty, tannic and bouncy. But in the final analysis it's not terribly original.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Opens with prickly, slightly stemmy aromas. The palate, however, is smooth and round, with chunkiness and roasted flavors of raspberry and plum that are true to warm-climate Pinot. Finishes warm, a bit toasty and chocolaty. Weighty but achieves balance with airing.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Deep, lush, balanced and oaky, with bacon, floral notes and huge raspberry and cassis aromas. Layered and structured across the palate, with concentration and balance to go with lusty cassis, blackberry, mocha and spice flavors. Finishes toasty and dark, with waves of espresso and mocha. Now–2015.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Slightly sharp and salinic smelling at first, but soon it veers toward strawberry and raspberry, with hints of smoke and rusticity. Still, for the most part this is a basic New World Cabernet with familiar cherry and plum flavors backed by a touch of chocolate. Feels creamy and medium-bodied, with healthy tannins and acids. A nice everyday Cab that doesn't overstep its limitations.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A little sharp and angular, with a touch of cat pee on the nose. But with air and time this bubbly rises above the masses. Flavors of lime, orange and apple are cleansing and fresh, while the feel is comfortable and a touch foamy. Lasting on the finish, with some class that hints at Champagne.",Sparkling Blend
Argentina,"At 50% Cab and 50% Malbec, this wine runs outside the mainstream for Argentina. It's dark in color but slightly green and stemmy on the nose. The palate offers a solid mouthfeel with flavors of baked berry fruit, earth and carob. It's sweet at its core, but mildly bitter and candied on the finish. Good but struggles to find a pleasurable sweet spot.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Candied black cherry aromas give this a sweet, rich outlook. The palate is bold and heavy, with ripe cassis and other heavy fruit flavors. It's a big, extracted wine that could use more balance and structure. To this taster, it seems denser and duller than past vintages. Frankly it's syrupy and chocolaty on the back palate and finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Clean, pure and lightweight, with aromas of citrus blossom and lychee. The mouth is zesty and crisp, with citrus, lychee and pineapple flavors. Don't expect miracles and it'll work wonders as an apéritif. But drink it soon to capture its white-fruit intensity. Tastes better and fresher than Andeluna's 2006 Torrontés.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Woody on the nose, with aromas of tree bark, pepper, cola and black fruit. The palate is tight but under control, with spiced black plum and herbal berry flavors. Toasty and healthy on the finish, but also slightly bitter tasting, with zesty lasting acidity.",Malbec
Argentina,"Full and forward smelling, with generic, slightly hot berry aromas. Feels good and tight, with a firm structure and sweet, lush red berry flavors. Narrows down on the finish, focusing on ripeness and red fruit. Nothing sour or astringent here.",Malbec
Argentina,"Foxy aromas are in the lead, backed by milk chocolate, a pinch of volatility and minty berry. The feel is good, with candied, herbal flavors of sweet berry and cassis. Sweet, sturdy and still a bit foxy on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lean and angular on the nose, with crisp cherry and rhubarb aromas. Surprisingly elegant in the mouth, with citrus notes, zesty raspberry, clean cherry and a lightness of being. Nice in an unassuming way, with a touch of complexity.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Bodega Chacra is Piero Incisa's personal project in Rio Negro, Argentina. It is only Pinot Noir, made by esteemed winemaker Hans Vinding Diers. This wine from vines planted in 1932 is linear and intense to the core. It's an ageworthy specimen with fine acidity and a tight structure. Now, it's juicy and a little sharp, with piercing black cherry fruit and spice galore. Best to wait another year or two to begin drinking, and beyond that it may last for another 5-10 years if well cellared.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Robust, deep and candied on the nose, with rooty richness, medicinal notes and complexity. The palate is smooth, meaty, healthy and suave, with lush black fruit, prune and earthy flavors. Long, likable and showing a lot of depth and structure. Drink now through 2014.",Malbec
Argentina,"Full, dense and dark, with powerful berry aromas and hints of rubber and leather on the bouquet. The palate breathes complexity and style but also raw power, and the flavors of blackberry, fig paste and herbs are just lusty and rich enough to register as modern Mendoza. Classy and deep; best from 2011–2015. A Malbec-Cabernet-Petit Verdot blend.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Consistent with prior vintages, this Malbec is a full-throttle wine with huge aromas of blackberry and cassis. This version is a bit more narrow and linear than in the past, but it's still excellent. Flavors of oak-based vanilla and coconut sit on top of vivacious berry fruit, while chocolate cake and coconut are the key flavors on a large, lusty finish. Drink through 2018.",Malbec
Argentina,"With robust aromas of cola, coffee, dry leaves and blackberry, this lusty blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Cabernet Franc outperforms its reasonable price tag. Despite being big and dark, the palate is juicy in feel. Flavors of cassis and black cherry are backed by chocolate and mocha, while the finish is deep and pure, with toasty notes and additional chocolate. Drink through 2018.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Quite dark and crusty on the nose, with aromas of road tar and obvious oak. Tough but real on the palate, with big tannins and lip-smacking berry and cherry flavors. Shows more oak character and resin than necessary, and thus the fruit flavors don't fully stack up to such heavy wood. Still, it gets it right more than wrong.",Malbec
Argentina,"A heavy, blocky wine with a dark color and aromas that lean toward raisin and reduced balsamic vinegar. The palate is quite full and slightly syrupy in feel, while the flavors are of boysenberry and dark, toasty oak. Finishes with even more crusty, espresso-like wood flavors, leaving displaced wood as the lasting impression.",Malbec
Argentina,"Aromas of cherry cough drop make the bouquet slightly medicinal, but beyond that it's solid and familiar. Moderate richness on the palate accompanies flavors of butter, strawberry and raspberry. Heat, wood resin and a touch of pickle work the finish. Good wine but it doesn't exactly go the extra mile.",Malbec
Argentina,"Herbal aromas are balanced by plenty of red fruit character. It's tough and tannic in the mouth, so food is almost a must. Tastes of herbal berry and stewed plums, and that's followed by a roasted, herbal finish. Tough in feel but honest in flavor.",Cabernet Franc
Argentina,"Full, solid and dishing pretty aromas of blackberry, dark plum and mild spice. Sturdy in the mouth, with nice balance and above-average mouthfeel. Tastes ripe, lightly toasted and it finishes smooth if a bit short. Textbook value Malbec; easy to like.",Malbec
Argentina,"Despite tough vintage conditions, Bodega Septima got this blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Tannat right. The nose is dark, solid and full of attractive black fruit and coconut aromas. Lush and a mile deep on the palate, with sultry, smoky, dark flavors of blackberry, licorice and spice. A chewy, rich and balanced wine; drink now through 2014.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Bella Vista is the richest, most dense of A-F's three single-vineyard Malbecs. It opens with leather, smoke, blueberry and floral aromas. Next in line is a chewy, dark palate of wild berry and earthy fruit flavors. Clean on the finish with a bit less acidity than its brothers, Altamira and Mirador. Drink now through 2015.",Malbec
Argentina,"The color is deep purple, the nose dense, alluring and hinting at mint, shoe polish, violet and blackberry. Flavors are pure, modestly oaky and deep in terms of wild berry, coffee and chocolate.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Light and waxy on the nose, with touches of custard, lychee and banana. This is not a driving, varietally convincing Torrontés, but it is balanced and refreshing. The flavors of melon and apple are solid, while the finish is quick but nice. Drink right away and it shouldn't be a disappointment.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Plump and fruity on the nose, but it also smells entirely familiar and generic. Like most Argentine Cabernets, this wine is tight, tannic and full of cassis and other berry fruits. What it's not is elegant, complex or different than the masses. If you like bold but basic berry flavors, tannic bite and chocolate on the finish, this is for you.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Quite neutral and distant on the nose, with dry apple flavors working the soft, balanced palate. There are complexities such as white pepper and nutty nuances, but in the end it's an average sparkler with a controlled approach. Good for Argentina but probably not ready to compete with the world's best $20 sparkling wines.",Sparkling Blend
Argentina,"Opens with mildly gassy, rubbery aromas that suggest reduction or brett. Once it airs out, however, it's a good, generic Cabernet with familiar flavors of black fruits, mocha and chocolate. It's a little herbal and lean across the palate and onto the finish, but for run-of-the-mill everyday Cab it does the trick.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Standard plum and berry aromas provide a nice opening to this dark, solid Malbec that's a little zingy and racy at its core. Flavors of plum and berry are typical for a wine of this class, which finishes with burnt flavors and a final resting place of grainy oak.",Malbec
Argentina,"Slightly carbonic and gassy at first, with huge candied fruit aromas. But quickly the wine settles, and out comes sweet blackberry flavors and some gumminess. It's a chunky, easy wine with medium tannins and modest plushness, which is something you shouldn't necessarily expect from a value-positioned wine. Short on the finish, but plump and buttery.",Malbec
Argentina,"From vines planted in 1955, this is a rose-tinted Pinot with a woven, integrated bouquet of toast, mineral and berry fruits. There's more Burgundian character here than New World, so it pours on the cerebral scents and flavors of tea, rose hip, strawberry and raspberry. Reserved in style, but good to drink now and over the next few years. If $100 seems like a lot to spend on Argentinean Pinot, you should try to give this a taste at some point; you may be convinced otherwise.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Layered berry and cassis aromas are a bit scratchy and gritty. This Cabernet feels saturated, pure and deep; flavors of blackberry, cassis, prune and chocolate are ripe and generous, while the finish is mildly herbal in flavor, with good length and build. Drink through 2018.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Ripe berry, cassis and grilled meat aromas presage a fresh, zesty palate with free-flowing acidity that pumps up cherry, red plum, cassis and loamy earth flavors. It stays fruity, stout and smooth on the finish. The wine is ripe and fully representative of Mendoza and winemaker Alejandro's Vigil's style.",Cabernet Franc
Argentina,"A little cheesy and raw at first, with aromas of cement, mint and light berry fruit. The palate is sort of thin and dilute for Malbec, with an emphasis on zingy red fruit more than dense, rich black stuff. Turns jumpy and lean on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"If you're looking for a pedestrian but true sparkling wine for under $10, this Chenin Blanc-based bubbly from Argentina is solid, a touch yeasty and dry. It tastes much like a Loire Valley sparkler, with baked apple, apricot and peach pit flavors. On the negative side, it's fairly foamy across the tongue and doesn't have a top-grade mouthfeel.",Sparkling Blend
Argentina,"Red in color, and definitely smelling and tasting like Malbec. And while you want to like it more, there are some glaring flaws here, namely a weak bead that turns it flat. Furthermore, there's rhubarby sourness at the core. Has its moments but needs more work.",Sparkling Blend
Argentina,"Stout and dense from the beginning, with blackberry and violet aromas. Despite being a bold and dark Malbec, this is fresh and composed, with sweet blackberry and cassis flavors. Good on the finish, with candied fruit and caramel sweetness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with tire rubber, char and minty, smoky black fruit. Feels mostly fresh and bold, with blackberry, blueberry and coffee flavors. Just dense, sweet and spicy enough, with espresso bitterness to the finish. Composed and competent value red wine.",Malbec-Syrah
Argentina,"Black and jammy on the bouquet, with a spot of minty green and licorice. It's softy and leans toward syrupy, with sweet, mildly baked flavors of black fruits and chocolate. Feels creamy and a little low on acidity, so drink soon.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Black in color, with minty aromas of blackened berry, leather and a slight horsey funk. Lush, soft and jammy in the mouth, with roasted, sweet-tasting flavors of stewed berry and raisin. Finishes soft and smooth, with mild tannins and sweet café mocha flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"Shockingly good for $10 Argentine Pinot. It's easy on the nose, with milk chocolate and raspberry aromas. The palate is juicy, tight and well balanced, with lightly roasted plum fruit, spice and mild barrel notes. Dry, spicy and honest on the finish.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Oaky, creamy and a bit lactic on the nose, with an easy style to the palate and ripe, sweet flavors of blackberry and black cherry that are delicious but lack complexity. Finishes big, syrupy and sweet, with a spot of raisin. Really good for a blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Petit Verdot. Drink now through 2013.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Big, dark, sweet and jammy on the nose, with earthy, candied, sweet aromas of ripe blackberry and herbs. The palate delivers bouncy, showy acidity, while the flavors of black cherry, dark plum and chocolate are solid and rewarding. A little pruney on deeper inspection, with a leathery quality to the wine's depth. Drink now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"This starts out massive and grapy, but with each passing minute it becomes more Salta, and hence more complex. Feral, leathery, roasted-berry aromas require patience. In the mouth, this is tannic and muscular, with herbal, spicy, dry flavors of blackberry and stewed plum. Raging acidity and firm tannins suggest that this needs at least until 2016 to settle.",Malbec
Argentina,"A blend of Malbec, Cab Sauvignon and Merlot, Centenario offers spicy, herbal black-fruit aromas along with tea leaf, animal notes and a bit of green. The palate is chunky and ripe in feel, with soft tannins. Flavors of toasted berry, coffee, bitter chocolate and green herbs finish comfortably. Drink through 2018.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"A little sweet on the nose, but also fairly scattered and unfocused. The feel is nice and the bubble bead is right on. But the flavors are centered around dull apple, and there seems to be a salinic element that makes everything taste a little salty.",Sparkling Blend
Argentina,"An interesting wine that walks to the beat of its own drum. Organic wines are almost always a little unusual, and this is no different. It pours on the funky red-fruit aromas and then come herbal cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. As a whole it's a good, well-made wine with decent feel. But hailing from La Rioja, it also has its own unfamiliar identity. Worth a try if organic wines are your thing.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Fiery and crisp, with decent berry and cherry aromas giving it character. The palate is medium to racy, with zesty raspberry, cherry and rhubarb flavors. Finishes short and a little prickly, with heat and a hint of chocolate. Very basic, but by no means a bad wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"There's more rhubarb and bramble here than we prefer from a young, everyday Malbec, and thus the bouquet is austere and only skin deep. As might be expected given the aromas, the palate is limited to herbal, lightly pickled red fruit, while the finish is quick and offers some lasting chocolate. Decent wine, but that's as far as it goes.",Malbec
Argentina,"Aromas of baked corn and citrus lead to a sharp, tangy palate that offers lemon and other citrus flavors, but not much heft or sweet fruit to balance things off. Thus it's a razor-sharp and edgy bubbly with lemony sourness all the way through the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Can't say that sparkling wines and whites are Toso's strong suit. This Pinot Noir-based wine is tan in color and smells and tastes a lot like carbonated Sherry. Flavors of dull citrus and nuts work the palate, while the finish is controlled but not all that lively.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Generous, sizable aromas of cassis, blackberry and violet are inviting. This is juicy, with slightly wiry acidity creating a racy mouthfeel. Flavors of berry and cassis are loamy on their own but ride comfortably on a wave of tartaric acidity, while the finish is lifted and lively, with black-fruit flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"Wines like this have defined and propelled Malbec mania. It's ripe, bold and firm, with welcoming berry aromas and a powerful but healthy palate of ripped black cherry, berry and cola flavors. In the mix and on the finish you'll find coffee and mocha. Drink now and over the next two years.",Malbec
Argentina,"Very clean, smooth and inviting. Every piece is in place, and the wine flows from nose to palate to finish with ease and comfort. Flavors of black cherry, cassis and blackberry are creamy and deep, with a hint of vanilla sweetness and oak. Warm and chewy as well. Cabernet Sauvignon with 12% Cab Franc; drink now.",Cabernet Blend
Argentina,"Ginger ale aromas and a foamy, gassy burn give this bubbly a personality similar to soda pop. The flavors are rather tart and green, with a note of green bean. Tastes and feels more narrow and vegetal than desired. On the plus side, it gets better the more it sits and the more you get to know it.",Sparkling Blend
Argentina,"From La Rioja, this Torrontés is quiet and neutral. It offers a little tangerine on the nose, and then acceptable but unexciting banana and pear flavors. Overall it's decent but bland.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Few wineries in Argentina make more individual wines than Achaval-Ferrer. And while some are great, others leave you scratching your head or wanting something different. This one has a deep hue but a strange mix of herbal, floral aromas that hint at air freshener. The palate is quite acid-driven and downright sharp, with pounding blueberry and kirsch flavors. More austere and tangy than we prefer.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fairly herbal, with burnt briar aromas that cause it to tilt toward acrid. The palate shows mostly tart cranberry and wild berry flavors, and while it looks dark to the eye, the wine is surprisingly shallow and a little bit sharp in the end run.",Malbec
Argentina,"Las Moras is from Argentina's La Rioja region, and Black Label aims to be its top product. But mostly the wine pushes minty, dark oak on top of superficial plum and berry fruit. It's extremely wooded, so the finish deals mint chip and raw wood flavors. A racy and sheer mouthfeel doesn't exactly help it along.",Malbec
Argentina,"Quite generic and arguably overoaked given the wine's core quality. The nose smells rubbery and then milky, while the palate is jammy and sticky, with sweet, candied, oaky fruit flavors. In our opinion it's too resiny and done up in woodspice, and thus the fruit never shines. Not nearly as good as Toso's basic Malbec.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Simple raspberry and cherry aromas carry rubbery side notes and a touch of floor polish. The palate is lean and generic, with red-fruit flavors and citrusy acidity. Modest, zesty and not much to it.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rubbery aromas vie with solid berry fruit notes. The palate is basic and a touch edgy in feel, with red plum, currant and herbal flavors. Peppery and minty on the finish, but juicy and correct overall.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Tightly wound aromas of rubber and black fruits preview a rubbery, fruity palate that's generous in its delivery of vanilla, creamy berry, black plum and cassis flavors. A comfortable finish with mocha and smooth tannins confirms that this is a cleanly made, modern red wine.",Cabernet Franc
Argentina,"Bold and packed to the gills with black fruit, well-applied oak and rubbery, fresh tannins. As Bonarda goes, this is a clear winner; it's blowsy and ribald on the nose, with tons of black fruit, coconut and mocha. The palate is firm but not overly hard, with fig, black plum and length to the finish. Drink now through 2012.",Bonarda
Argentina,"A bit rusty in color and mature, but that's what makes this wine different than most. It's earthy, a bit leathery and muddled, and slightly baked. But it's also subdued, mellow and sturdy, with lighter tannins and hints of herbs to go with finely roasted berry and tomato flavors. Integrated, long and spicy late. Drink now through 2012.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Sort of gaseous and touchy on the nose, with bramble and sweaty leather rising up once the bouquet opens. The palate offers a quick flash of berry fruit but nothing backing that up, and the finish is gone in seconds. Basically this is a light-bodied quaffer that seeks not to offend.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Aggressive and ultra-bubbly, with gassy apple, pear and pineapple aromas. The palate runs sharp, with green apple controlling the flavor profile. Sudsy and monotone on the finish, with a bland, green-ish aftertaste.",Sparkling Blend
Argentina,"Neither overpowering nor impressive. In fact, this is a flat, underdeveloped Torrontés with aromas of air freshener and flavors of banana, papaya and sugared doughnuts. It's not awful but it's the kind of wine that does nothing but fall apart once the cork is pulled.",Torrontés
Argentina,"This is the first Torrontés from Pascual Toso that we've rated, and if it's any indication of what's going on there, then we say stick to the reds. This is a borderline dud, with chunky, hollow flavors and a mealy finish. Not a total mess but not a good, vivacious Argentine Torrontes by any stretch.",Torrontés
Argentina,"The only thing that makes this a gran reserva is the label and the winery's commitment to a big, extracted, heavily oaked wine. It's black as ink but clumsy as can be. Smells and tastes like shoe polish, resin and oily fruit. Not what we're looking for from Argentina, or anywhere for that matter. Barely acceptable. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with clean, standard tropical fruit aromas. The palate follows suit with a tight mouthfeel and tropical flavors of melon, baNAa and peach, all accented by a spot of vanilla. Mildly pithy and toasty on the finish. Good Argentine Chardonnay for the price.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Solid berry fruit aromas greet you, then turn a bit herbal and strained with airing. The palate has a healthy feel and reasonably good flavors of baked berry, herbs and mint. Blackberry notes carry the finish along with herbs, caramel and choppy tannins.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Clean, citric and precise on the nose, then exceedingly lean and pointy in the mouth, where uncompromised flavors of mineral, lime and orange peel set up a chalky, crisp finish. Mouthwatering and cleansing.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"This oaky, creamy Malbec is one of Karim Mussi Saffie's trilogy of 2011 La Consulta single-vineyard varietals, and they are so similar in aromas, body weight, flavors and high oak levels that they are virtually interchangeable. Like its bretheren, this pours on the wood, vanilla, graphite, pencil eraser and resin along with sweet blackberry and cassis flavors. Maybe with time in the bottle it'll gain more individuality.",Malbec
Argentina,"The nose offers both minerally crispness and full-fledged black-fruit aromas. Chunky and meaty in feel, the wine has baked, loamy flavors of blackberry and plum that hold onto their vitality. A medium-long finish with hints of salted beef, leather and chocolate provides for a good ending.",Malbec
Argentina,"Here's a Bordeaux-style blend to snap up if you're lucky enough to find it. It's a definite re-issue in that it was first released at $25 in 2006 but was put back on the market last year at $15. And what a bargain it is: Earth, tar and tobacco vie with dried cherry and raspberry on the nose and palate; the finish is long, elegant and dry. A mature, classy wine to drink now.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Plenty of mocha and vanilla combined with racy berry aromas give this an ice cream sundae-type of bouquet. The palate is healthy and snappy, with lively acidity pushing black cherry and meaty plum flavors. Whole and toasty on the finish, with touches of excellence throughout. Impressive for a first effort, with room to improve. Drink now through 2012.",Malbec
Argentina,"Almost everything about this wine is right on the money, from bouquet and flavors to feel and price. The nose is sweet and floral, with deep, alluring berry aromas. The palate offers a fine texture, with pure, layered blackberry, cola and spice flavors. Satisfying on the finish and complete.",Malbec
Argentina,"Brushy and brambly smelling at first, then cleaner and fruitier as it breathes. Full and juicy in the mouth, with lightly toasted berry and plum flavors that register as regular but fresh. Long and linear on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Baked fruit and coconut are the lead aromas, and there's cassis and stewed berry scents as well. Gritty in the mouth, with sweet, medicinal berry fruit flavors, coconut and chocolate. Stocky, ripe, tannic and medicinal on the finish.",Cabernet Franc
Argentina,"Jammy on the nose, with a citrusy element, green notes and something muddy. For a big Malbec with a full price tag, it leaves me wondering: It's chunky and tastes of red berry, citrus, pineapple and marshmallow. Jumbled and sweet on the finish. Has enough good in it not to tank but it's not in full harmony.",Malbec
Argentina,"A rich and creamy wine with good structure and plenty of fruit. The nose yields berry essence, vanilla and smoky wood notes, while the palate has depth, layering and composed flavors. There's coffee and chocolate on the finish, and the texture and length seem just right. It's oaky for sure, but this vintage of Q can handle it. Drink now through 2012.",Malbec
Argentina,"Deep purple in color and liberally oaked, but that fits the program at Catena. The bouquet is burly and shows hickory, marmalade and toast, while the palate revolves around boisterous blueberry and boysenberry flavors along with wood smoke and integrated tannins. It's extracted but balanced, and the finish is sweet yet rustic. Drink now through 2011.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark and heavily oaked on first blush, but give it time to unwind or let it sit in the bottle for a year or two and this will satisfy any Malbec lover. Early on, it's dense and full of shoe polish, mint and coconut; later it spreads out to show sweet dark-berry flavors and finally a rich, almost sticky finish of woodspice, brown sugar and lushness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Earthy, gritty aromas of asphalt mix with fruitier notes of cherry and plum to form an attractive, harmonious nose. This Cabernet is pure and light on its feet; flavors of coffee, cola and dried red fruits finish with elegance and femininity. Drink through 2016.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Smells barbecued and saucy, with dry oak, resin and smoked meat aromas. The palate is more acidic, while the flavors lean toward resiny and saucy, i.e. hickory and roasted berry. Oaky on the finish, with sawdust and vanilla flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"Minty, floral aromas veer toward darker notes of cola, forest floor and leather. The palate is medium-full, with grabby tannins and roasted flavors of blackberry mixed with herbs and spice. A regular, oaky style of Cabernet with a raw, grabby mouthfeel.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Opens with aromas of mint and latex, then the oak rises up, leaving vanilla and sawdust scents. Dry tannins and good size set up a minty-tasting flavor profile with resin and wild berry flavors. Finishes with anise and licorice, and just enough acidity to keep it balanced.",Malbec
Argentina,"Woody and smelling of sawdust early, this four-grape blend eases toward roasted berry, cassis, herbal plum and molten chocolate. It's massive and structured, with a big-boned skeleton and heat on the leathery, roasted finish due to 15.5% alcohol. Big, fiery, saucy and lusty, but short on refinement and elegance.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Round, dense and correct on the nose, with heft and dark fruit aromas. The palate is tight, pure and just the right size, with blackberry, boysenberry and a bit of vanilla and caramel in the background. Smooth on the tail end, with sweet coconut and mocha notes. Friendly and well done for the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"A rich and creamy sort of Malbec that pours on the weight, extract and oaky, coconutty character. The palate is syrupy, with huge flavors of roasted berry, molasses and sweet spices. Arguably on the baked and heavy side, but definitely a rich, huge wine with just enough core acidity to keep it balanced.",Malbec
Argentina,"Aromas of blackberry, balsam wood, lemony oak and forest floor lead into a fully stocked, hefty palate. Flavors of black fruits, licorice, herbs and oak finish bright but level. What this lacks in complexity is made up for in ripe berry flavors and overall balance.",Malbec
Argentina,"Minerally and firm on the nose, it bursts with blackberry and plum aromas. In the mouth, this is lively and medium bodied, while nice acidity allows it to roll over the palate while showing earthy flavors of black fruits and rubber. A saucy, leathery, meaty-tasting finish is friendly in feel.",Malbec
Argentina,"Very red and slightly grassy on the nose, with aromas of strawberry, mint leaf and rhubarb. It's a juicy screamer in the mouth, with intensity, blazing acidity and wild raspberry and plum flavors. Dry, tight and long on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"The name and packaging scream “concept wine,” but what's in the bottle will win you over. It's full and rubbery, with pleasant yet generic berry aromas. The palate is racy and fairly hefty and tannic, with black raspberry, plum and mild herbal flavors. Grabby, with good acidity on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A big drop off from prior years, probably due to the cold harvest conditions of 2008. Smells minty and lactic, with hard spice and distant fruit aromas. Feels closed, tannic and clipped, with narrow berry flavors and green notes. Toasty on the finish, but also clacky feeling. Good relative to other wines, but not at $70.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rubbery, bold and earthy on the nose, then full and sticky in the mouth, with sweet black fruit flavors. Tastes more like a Bordeaux red wine than textbook Pinot Noir courtesy of heavy extraction, darkness and oak. Tastes good but could use a lesson in elegance and restraint.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Whether it's this single-vineyard Malbec or its partners below (Turcos or Tanos), the characteristics of each are nearly identical: creamy oak, tons of vanilla and milk chocolate, resiny mouthfeels and rich, sweet berry flavors. Pick one or pick them all; they are quasi interchangeable and only time will tell if they show individuality or remain identical triplets.",Malbec
Argentina,"Los Tanos hails from La Consulta in the Uco Valley, as does its brothers, Los Turcos and Los Gallegos. As stated in the Turcos and Gallegos reviews, these wines are triplets in terms of their oaky, creamy, sweet characteristics and overt richness. Tasted side by side by side, they are almost one in the same, with an emphasis on creamy oak, resiny mouthfeels and ripe berry fruits.",Malbec
Argentina,"This ultraripe, happy Cab Franc bursts on the scene with jammy blackberry and prune aromas. The mouthfeel is lush, almost syrupy. Flavors of ultraripe blackberry, cassis and loamy earth finish warm, lusty and with chocolate and coffee notes.",Cabernet Franc
Argentina,"Loud, charred aromas start out gaseous but turn more elegant, peppery and lightly herbal with airing. This wine is ripe, deeply built and firm in feel; flavors of cassis and sweet, candied blackberry finish subtle and quietly long.",Malbec
Argentina,"Like a good Bonarda should be, this is sweet, lush, dense and jammy on the nose. The palate brings big tannins and a slight rubbery mouthfeel, but the flavors of black cherry and wild berry are big, tasty and untamed. Full of power; needs airing upon opening but aging isn't necessary. Includes 20% Malbec and 10% Cab Franc.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Dark as night, with shoe polish, coconut and powerful black-fruit aromas. This is jammy, dense, soft and not for aging, but it does deliver a truck load of toasted coffee, blackberry, molasses and crisped brown sugar. Supersweet, rich and made to drink now.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Sweet aromas of sugar cookie come with a pinch of citrus fruit. The mouth is plump, with just enough citric acidity to keep it together. Flavors of pineapple, lemon, tangerine and grapefruit peel lead to a pithy, slightly bitter finish. Drink immediately; it's starting to fade.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"An elegant, floral Pinot Noir from Patagonia's top producer of PN. Barda is warm, creamy and intense. An emphasis on balanced raspberry and cherry flavors mixed with rose hip and freshness gives it an Old World personality. A very drinkable and honest style of red wine. Good now into 2011.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"After a rubbery opening, this blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Bonarda picks up steam and freshens up significantly. Aromas of sly dried berry take over, leading to a full, flush palate of plum, raspberry and raisin. Comes around the more time you spend with it.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Very nice Malbec for the money. The bouquet is floral and bright, with a hint of dry oak and mocha. The feel is full and well balanced, while the palate has a bright and lively personality with cherry, raspberry, chocolate and spice flavors. Smooth, tastes good and offers plenty of value.",Malbec
Argentina,"A dark and toasty specimen with a deep-purple tint and aromas of oak, butter and powerful blackberry fruit. The palate is textured and rich, with thick, smoky flavors of black fruits and peppery spice. Pours on the oak but in an integrated way; very good for varietal Cab from 2008.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dark, sweet and rooty on the nose, with a warm, soft outlook. The palate is bold and thorough, with ripe berry, plum and chocolate flavors. Per usual, Punto Final is ripe, sweet and big, with a peppery finish and toasty, jammy warmth.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lively but also narrow on the nose. The feel is very fresh and juicy due to firm, bracing acidity that gives a tangy, lemony character to the wine's dark-fruit core. Snappy, linear and crisp for a wine of magnitude and extraction. Some might say it's sheering and acidic; others might call it ageworthy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark and raisiny, and pushing the ripeness meter to the max. This is a dense, sweet, semihot wine with raisin, stewed berry and jammy black cherry flavors. It's big and broad, more simple than complex, with a raisiny DNA and a boatload of sweetness. Personally, I prefer Cassone's less expensive, more balanced reserva to this wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Berry, cola, pepper and lemon peel aromas are taken down a notch by a note of spent coffee grinds. The palate is grabby, with creamy flavors of chocolate, vanilla, berry and milkshake. Finishes thick and sweet.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tropical and a bit briney on the nose. The palate is healthy in feel, with sweet white fruit flavors, a pinch of lemon and creamy oak. Finishes quick, with a nice feel and adequate acidity; will do best if well chilled.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Neutral smelling except for a bit of lime, grass and mineral. Feels juicy and citric in the mouth, with pithy flavors of lime, orange and green grass. Finishes slightly bitter and pithy, but fresh and tangy.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Grassy red berry and plum aromas lead to a lean, somewhat high-acid palate with herbal, oaky flavors of raspberry and plum that don't last that long. Fresh and healthy feeling on the finish, but tasting more of oak and spice than fruit.",Malbec
Argentina,"A tale of two wines. The early impression is that of a foxy, incomplete, sweaty wine with gaps in the fabric. But once it gets air, things turn around for the better. Ultimately it proves itself as a serious Malbec with a broad texture and jammy, sweet berry fruit. But it starts out so scattered and funky that it remains compromised.",Malbec
Argentina,"Earthy and rugged at first, then it smoothes out to show cola and lush berry aromas. Plump and round in the mouth, with jammy blackberry core flavors, a hint of herbs and spice, and then a chewy, sticky, generous finish. Very nice Malbec with a cool identity.",Malbec
Argentina,"An improvement over the 2008 version, this wine starts with rubbery aromas of berry fruits and earth, and there's a pinch of sulphuric matchstick tossed in. Plump and full in the mouth, with berry, herb and peppery flavors. Shows some chocolaty richness on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Floral and jammy smelling, with blueberry fruit and fennel aromas. Saturated and choppy feeling, with candied fruit flavors mixed with herbal notes. Just solid enough on the finish despite some holes in the fabric. Juicy and forward as a whole.",Malbec
Argentina,"Aromas of wet cement, pencil eraser, plastic, vanilla and jammy blueberry come in front of a racy palate with pronounced acidity and flavors of spiced cherry, plum and herbs. A long finish with power beats its chest before flattening out and turning heavy.",Cabernet Franc
Argentina,"Black-fruit aromas come with notes of rubber and smoke. Full and rugged feeling, the wine has juicy acidity and inherent raciness. Flavors of blackberry lean toward jammy, while subtle oak notes enhance this full-bodied, fruity red.",Bonarda
Argentina,"This extracted, oaky wine is generous on the nose, with minerally notes, iodine and potent blackberry aromas. It's big but balanced, and the flavor profile delivers common berry, toast and oaky flavors that finish strong and with espresso-like bitterness.",Malbec
Argentina,"A well-made everyday Malbec that gets it done in all ways. Smells nice and floral, with bold, smooth berry aromas. The palate is fresh and lively, with juicy berry flavors, controlled creamy oak notes and spice. Clean on the finish, and a pleasure to drink.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with candied, chocolaty aromas that contradict its age. In the mouth, it's mature although the structure is breaking up; nonetheless, it's interesting and attractive, with herb, raspberry, tea, tobacco and chocolate flavors. Overall it's a different breed, and despite having lost its structure it's sly and well worth a go. Drink now.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A nice, clean, fairly complex white is what this is. The nose is all lychee and jasmine, and it's not at all heavy or oily. The palate is bouncy and fresh, with a tropical mix of lychee, melon and papaya flavors. Agile on the finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Graham cracker is the lead aroma, and that's followed by jammy fruit, cookie dough and finally a touch of raisin. The palate is plump for an '08, with berry flavors, herbal notes and some bitterness. A touch clipped and rough, but a good effort for a tough year.",Malbec
Argentina,"This earthy, mature Cab is rusty in color, with aromas of dried red fruits, tobacco and leaves leading to a medium-bodied, smooth palate. Flavors of cola, cocoa, red licorice and cherry finish with mellow tannins and a final dusting of cocoa powder. Drink now.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Spiced berry and cassis are the lead aromas on this medium-bodied, zippy Malbec. In the mouth, this shows mostly fresh acidity, red-fruit zest and snap. Flavors of loamy berry, baked plum and earth run dry, while the finish is compact in feel, light in weight and overall seems clean and fresh.",Malbec
Argentina,"Bold berry fruit, mint, shoe polish and creamy oak aromas are present on the nose of this full, plump, fairly tannic Malbec. Flavors of ripe blackberry, spice and raw oak finish toasty and pure, with good length and clarity.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dry aromas of leafy, spicy red-berry fruits register as complex and mature. Medium in body, it has integrated tannins and acids. Flavors of lightly baked cherry and sweet red currant are earthy and finish with notes of cocoa powder, raspberry and plum. Drink now.",Merlot
Argentina,"Plum and berry aromas are expressive and a touch gritty. This Malbec feels round and medium to full in body, with present but controlled tannins. Oak, lactic notes and black-fruit flavors finish minty and with natural herbal hints along with healthy, bracing acidity.",Malbec
Argentina,"Oaky up front, with more than a dash of mocha, caramel and sweet berry fruit aromas. The palate is zesty and honest, with juicy, bright black cherry and berry flavors. Finishes toasty and perky, with one last shot of firm acidity to keep it running long and late.",Malbec
Argentina,"With attractive melon and other tropical aromas, this is a Torrontés that rises above the masses. It smells great and tastes like a pure blend of lychee fruit, tangerine and honeydew melon. The palate feel is smooth and round, and the finish is dry, clean and healthy. It's everything that Torrontés should be. Drink now.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Heavy oak greets you on the nose in the form of shoe polish and blackened aromas. This feels ripe, solid and woody, with good structure. Flavors of plum, mint and oak resin turn spicy and minty if given time, while the finish is driven by crisp acidity and plum and raspberry flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pure is yet another addition to Trapiche's overflowing stable of Malbecs. This is big, grabby and shows chocolate, floral, herbal and perfumed berry aromas. A choppy but flush mouthfeel stages herbal-leaning, red-fruit flavors that carry a touch of green that's seconded on a minty, herbal, plump feeling finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Round, lifted and bright, with full berry, cassis and plum aromas. The palate is round and the body full, while the flavor profile includes roasted blackberry, coffee, chocolate and coconut. A full and chewy wine that comes across nice given the troubles of the '08 vintage.",Malbec
Argentina,"A pretty white wine with lively aromas, flavors and feel. The bouquet issues attractive lychee, melon and vanilla cream aromas, while the palate flows forth with apple, melon and exotic citrus flavors. Just spicy enough on the tail end, with a lasting taste of lychee fruit. Delicate, solid and fresh.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Blackberry, rubber and a suggestion of minerality work well as an invitation to this juicy, woody wine that's long and full in the mouth, with dark-fruit flavors of black cherry, blackberry and plum. Woody and toasty, too, but dry and spicy rather than sweet, blowsy and creamy. A nice Malbec for all occasions.",Malbec
Argentina,"Minty, oaky and spicy up front, with cherry and berry aromas that are potent. The palate is lush, flush and tannic, with aggressive flavors of bacon, smoke, roasted blackberry and savory spices. It finishes well, with freshness along with a dark, smoky tail.",Syrah
Argentina,"A well-made Malbec that should please almost any fan of red wine. The nose is concentrated and full of black fruit, so it delivers what you'd expect. The mouthfeel is balanced, with medium weight and easy tannins. Black-fruit tastes of all types make for a solid flavor profile, and the finish offers mocha and cleansing acidity. A rock-solid wine for beef and pastas.",Malbec
Argentina,"For a tough, cool vintage, this wine displays lush qualities and depth, bordering on jamminess. Flavors of baked plums and cassis rest on a plump, soft palate with little tannic bite. All in all, it may be a little overripe, which is why the finish is short. But as a whole this is a tasty wine, especially considering the year.",Malbec
Argentina,"Aromas of brick dust, tobacco, red flowers and cassis come with a touch of herbal green scents. This feels healthy and balanced, with flavors of herbal berry and currant. Things turn a bit saucy and more herbal on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This wine requires breathing time to show its true colors. Early on it's reduced and cheesy, but soon it offers cleaner aromas of cola, berry and dark plum. The acidity is a bit high and sheering, but on the plus side it's fresh and driving, with bright cherry and berry flavors along with ample oak.",Malbec
Argentina,"Floral and fruity to open the show, and then there's plenty of oak and resin aromas coming next. The palate is tight, acid rich and woody, with solid black fruit flavors along with toasted oak notes and coconut. Juicy, fresh and healthy, but quite oaky.",Malbec
Argentina,"Starts out earthy and gaseous but the bouquet settles on round, full blackberry aromas. Lush, grabby and full in the mouth, with bold blackberry flavors that are clean, forward, uncomplicated and even a bit elegant. Tastes good and comes across smooth and polished for Bonarda.",Bonarda
Argentina,"A wonderful wine from the Uco Valley of Mendoza that opens with fine fruit, richness and molten earth. The palate is big as they come but not hard and out of whack, and the flavors are an amalgam of rich black plum, berry fruit, fig paste and chocolate. Smoky and sultry on the back end, with mocha and coffee for finishing notes. Drink now through 2014.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Light, airy, tropical and very nice for an under-$10 Argentine Chardonnay. The nose is nice and easy, while the flavors of orange, melon and lychee are tropical but seem right for the wine's body and acidity. Easygoing as they come, with a hint of sweetness on the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Initially it smells flat and earthy, with raisiny black fruit aromas. As it airs out it improves, but throughout its run it comes across heavy and wayward, with raisiny flavors and a simple dullness that prevents the wine from rising to the next level. Good Malbec but not a value at $45.",Malbec
Argentina,"By all accounts, 2008 was a tough vintage with cool weather, stunting frosts and ripeness issues. This wine seems afflicted: its opening is good, with coconut and floral shadings. But the palate is limited in richness and the flavors are standard, with char and barrel notes creating bitterness. Nice and honest for a subpar year.",Malbec
Argentina,"Raisiny black-fruit aromas are jammy and a clarion indicator of what's to come. In the mouth, this Malbec is saturated and chunky, with extreme ripeness. Flavors of raisin, prune and baked berry fruits come with secondary spice and pepper notes. The finish is earthy, heavy and rich but short on vibrancy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Blueberry and boysenberry aromas are deep and slightly reduced in nature. This is a chunky, wide-bodied wine with wiry acidity and more power than elegance. Flavors of roasted, toasted black fruits finish blocky and with espresso-like bitterness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Despite having several years in bottle, this Malbec opens with a huge blast of charred oak, shoe polish, lemon peel and rooty berry aromas. The palate is clipped and linear in feel, while flavors of coconut, vanilla and generic berry finish with lasting coconut and unsettled oak.",Malbec
Argentina,"Hard, charred oak and cedar are the lead aromas on this woody Malbec, which also shows lemon peel and blackberry on the nose. The palate is tight and pushy, mixing flavors of toasty black fruits with raw oak resin and bitter chocolate. On the finish, there's heat and even more oak.",Malbec
Argentina,"Having tasted the previous vintages and not liking them all that much, I can safely say that this 2010 is a much better, cleaner, more varietally correct version of Torrontés. It's clean, fresh and defined by light aromas and flavors of lime and green melon. Juicy and soda-like on the finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Sweet and savory aromas of hickory, BBQ and plum jam are nice, while the body is structured and full. The flavors follow the nose, meaning there's a savory, roasted quality to the wine but also jammy raspberry fruit notes. Chewy and a bit marinated, but it's quite good for the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sweet and candied on the nose, with marshmallow, cotton candy, chocolate-dipped cherry and dustiness. The palate has a pure feel and good ripeness, with flavors of herbal berry, toast, coffee and spice. Warm, chocolaty and oaky, with a lasting mocha flavor.",Malbec
Argentina,"Bold and pruney, with herbal, soft, ultraripe aromas in front of a jumpy yet partially stewed palate. This blend of Malbec with Bonarda and Syrah is your typical huge, tannic bruiser with big extract, huge tannins and just enough acidity to keep it pumping. Pretty good and perfectly drinkable, but a little over the edge.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Bright, playful berry and plum aromas are clean and fruity. Fresh and juicy, it shows firm but not jagged acidity. Flavors of ripe plum, berry, cocoa powder and herbs finish in forward fashion and not too oaky.",Bonarda
Argentina,"As the higher-end 2008s hit the market, the vintage's underwhelming character is confirmed via wines like this. Oaky and rubbery on the nose, with scattered, lean berry fruit flavors and bitterness. Like many '08s, it's short on richness and comes across unfocused. That said, it's still a good wine that's not badly made.",Malbec
Argentina,"Given the difficulties of 2008, this is a commendable, drinkable wine. The nose is full and dark, with ripe berry aromas. That leads to a tannic, semisharp palate with spunky blackberry fruit that comes with spice and chocolate shadings. Flavorful and correct, but a little tight and tough.",Malbec
Argentina,"Clean and tropical, and not too heavy, oily or chunky. The nose is pure lemon, pear and apple, while the flavor profile revolves around citrus, apple and honey in the center. Finishes sweeter than it starts, but with dry papaya for balance. Good everyday Chardonnay from Argentina, something we don't see too often.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Earthy and warm on first take, with deep fruit and soupy side aromas. The palate is juicy and lively, with blackberry flavors as well as toasty accents. Round, ripe and generous on the finish, with brightness but also a syrupy side. All in all it's a good wine for the money.",Malbec
Argentina,"A touch creamy and showing fresh corn and haystack on the nose, but in the mouth it's plump, good and mild, with fleshy white fruit flavors sitting in front of a smooth, lightly pithy finish. Yes, it's another warm-climate tropical Chardonnay. But it's a good one that's easy to drink.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Char, sawdust and black cherry aromas confirm the wine's “oak cask” labeling. Full bodied and ripe, it conveys meaty thickness and bold flavors of berry and spiced plum. A toasty, charred finish is lifted by bright acidity and fresh black-fruit flavors. This will go well with just about anything off the grill.",Syrah
Argentina,"In this easy-drinking wine, jammy aromas of multiple black fruits lead to a soft, simple palate with a streak of bracing tartaric acid. Straightforward blackberry flavors come with little to no complexity, while the finish is quick and fades away with modest grip and length.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big aromas of blackberry and raspberry feed into a full, fresh and ultimately standard palate with grapy blackberry flavors that show a controlled herbal side. Toasty and a touch bitter on the finish, it has a minty aftertaste.",Malbec
Argentina,"Leathery aromas blend well with concentrated black-fruit scents. In the mouth, this value-priced Malbec offers juicy purity and plenty of spunk. Flavors of black fruits, licorice and chocolate maintain a sense of freshness, while the finish offers residual blackberry and cassis flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"Initially this Malbec smells pinched and of cheesy leather, although with airing the nose shifts to latex and heavy berry aromas. The mouthfeel is chewy and blocky, while flavors of earthy black fruits, herbs and dried spices finish roasted and briny.",Malbec
Argentina,"Extremely ripe and concentrated but arguably a bit too massive for its own good. That said, we love the wine's tobacco, cassis and inky qualities, but worry a little about the lemony oak character and overall potency. Deep as midnight in terms of flavors, with black fruits galore setting up a richly packed, ultraripe finish. New World to the max but very tasty and rich.",Syrah
Argentina,"Concentrated, dark and clean for a basic 2008 Cabernet, with full but generic berry aromas and a pinch of rubber. The body is good and so is the structure, and overall the wine's roasted berry flavors blend well with sweet vanilla and caramel. Very good for value-priced Argentine CS.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Ripe plum and berry aromas come with spice notes before a supremely generous palate that's loud and flavorful in blackberry, cassis and black cherry fruit. On the finish, chocolate and oak influences roll in as the tannins subside. For power, flavor and clarity, this is a sure bet.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Spicy, dry aromas of earth, red currant and black olive offer some complexity and style. This is full bodied, racy and loaded with black cherry, cassis and peppery spice flavors. A touch of heat and menthol adds jolt to the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Standard berry aromas come with notes of leather and animal. This is firm, clacky and shows biting tannins, while the flavor profile revolves around herbal blackberry with a pinch of salt. Chocolaty oak and herbal influences guide the finish on this firm, slightly abrasive wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smoky, dark, rich and very oaky, with leather and cheese aromas. This is one concentrated, tannic bruiser; it's fully extracted and roasted, with blackberry, molasses, pepper and coffee flavors. A lush, round, jammy specimen that pours on richness in place of elegance and sophistication.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Warm and generous on the nose, with hints of brick dust and herbal strawberry fruit. Seems healthy and ready in the mouth, with good berry fruit, moderate spice notes and just a minor touch of herbal character. Works well, although it worked better when it was an under-$10 wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Minty and heavily oaked, with creamy aromas of vanilla bean, milk chocolate and raisiny sweetness. The palate smacks down with a tight, rubbery feel and then unleashes heavy, toasty flavors of herbal berry fruit, raw oak and mocha. Good for a rich, robust wine but it doesn't excel and it seems a little out of balance.",Red Blend
Argentina,"This Malbec from a cool vintage opens with a mix of gritty plum and jammy berry aromas. In the mouth, it's deep enough but compact. Flavors of herbal plum, minty oak and wild berry finish with a mild herbal note and juicy acidity.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dry and medium in body, this Cab from a warm vintage is simple but friendly, with nice cassis and raspberry aromas. Juicy and lively on the palate, it holds red-fruit flavors accented by spice and herbs, particularly mint. A mild finish makes it an easy drinker.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Opens with a slight chemical-smelling topping to berry, raisin and cheesy aromas. The palate is chunky on one hand and driving on the other, with berry and raisiny flavors. Lush on the finish but raisiny, and overall it settles on soft-bodied and flush.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big and nice, with bacon, rubber and espresso aromas. There's a lot of color and heft to this Malbec, which belies the vintage to an extent. Look for nicely interwoven plum and berry flavors in front of a wavy, balanced finish. Pretty deep given that 2007 was an abnormally cool year in Mendoza.",Malbec
Argentina,"A standard but well-done red blend. The nose deals lively plum and blackberry aromas, but also a slight hint of pickle. It's juicy and ripe-feeling on the palate, where red-fruit flavors of plum, cherry and raspberry are dominant. Solid and warm on the finish, and healthy and honest overall. It's 75% Malbec with 15% Syrah and 10% Bonarda.",Malbec
Argentina,"Floral aromas and berry power up front, then lead to a fresh, bright, almost screechy feeling palate. Toasty berry fruit flavors are moderately spicy and the finish offers a reprise of toastiness and kick. This wine contains 15% Malbec and Bonarda, which makes it more fruity.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A power-packed blend of 60% Cabernet and 40% Merlot that offers mossy aromas, earth and lush black fruit scents. The palate is lively yet balanced, with saturated wild berry, toast, anise and pepper flavors. Dark, toasted and showing licorice on the finish. A little hot and aggressive, so drink in late 2010 through 2012.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Big and purple, with ripe aromas of black fruits and bacon. The mouth is filling and full, with oaky blackberry, coffee and mildly roasted flavors. Turns more lush and soft on the finish, which is long and tastes of fig paste and prunes. Gets it done for the most part.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Pungent aromas of citrus range from lemon to orange, and there's also an oily element to the bouquet. The palate has a highly regular, almost lazy feel to it along with flavors of pithy citrus and nectarine pit. Finishes lemony and melony.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Opens with standard cherry/berry aromas, although with airing cheese notes and dill enter the picture. The palate is meaty in feel, with firm, tough, slightly roasted plum and berry flavors. Finishes hot, with a bold plum and berry character.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tropical and typical for the variety, with lychee and oily match stick on the nose. The palate is competent, with lemon-lime, apple and spiced Asian pear flavors. Dries out nicely on the finish; good Torrontés to drink as soon as possible.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Ripe plum and berry aromas are supported by a full dose of smoky, savory oak. The palate is round yet jagged, while flavors of toasty, chocolaty berry fruits are also lightly herbal and heavily oaked.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This oak-heavy Syrah from northern Argentina opens with milk chocolate, mint, vanilla and briary berry aromas. The palate is full and chewy, with a creamy, resiny feel and peppery, spicy, herbal blackberry flavors. An oaky, slightly green tasting finish is round in feel.",Syrah
Argentina,"Aromas of tarry asphalt, hockey puck and pasty oak dominate the creamy berry component. Jammy in feel, it has prune, spiced berry and herbal flavors. On the finish, the tannins are grabby while volume drowns out finesse.",Cabernet Franc
Argentina,"With floral aromas, toasty oak notes and solid berry fruit, this bottling is the best among Trapiche's 2007 single-vineyard Malbecs. The palate features smoky berry fruit but also high acidity and some scour. Fortunately it's also layered and structured. Will do best with meats and fatty foods. Drink now through 2015.",Malbec
Argentina,"Waxy and warm, with peach, sweet ham, spice and vanilla aromas. As Catena Alta goes, this is not stellar. In fact, it's light on fruit and lacks the depth of flavor and punch you'd hope to see from a $34 wine. What you get is a fleshy, soft Chard with mild peach, papaya and melon flavors, and then a whack of finishing oak.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Firm and leathery smelling, with a drying, oaky nose and then lifted, sweet flavors of jammy raspberry and cassis. The fruit here is riper than many '08 Cabs, and while it's a bit lean in feel, it tastes good and offers ample spice for balance.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Simple, well made and tropical, with a touch of oak. The palate is zesty, citric and healthy, with pineapple and orange flavors along with a pinch of star anise, vanillin and pith. Finishes fresh and juicy, with mild vanilla shadings.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Rubbery, tarry and quite black in nature, with a full-bodied mouthfeel and meaty, spicy dark-berry flavors. This ranks as a voluminous wine with a heavy disposition; it's sweet and spicy late, with generic bold-fruit character throughout.",Syrah
Argentina,"Modest, minerally and clean, with mild dusty apple aromas. The palate is pillowy and comfortable, with just enough acidity to push up the apple, green grape and white plum flavors. Finishes similarly, with a sweet lasting impression.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"A good value Cabernet from Argentina? You bet. This one smells like a bowl full of berries touched up with spice, vanilla and leather. It's fresh and ripe in the mouth, with flavors of blackberry jam and nutmeg. Smooth on the finish, it gets things right without pushing the envelope.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"As Argentinean rosé goes, Maipe's is a success. The wine is clean and colorful, with cheerful cherry and raspberry aromas that are decidedly not funky, skunky or stale. The palate is snappy, with mild berry fruit flavors and a clean, medium-length finish. Candied and friendly but not forced. Drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"Altocedro's 2011 stable of high-end Malbecs all carry something in common: heavy, creamy oak that gives the wines severe milk chocolate and vanilla characteristics. This is sticky in feel, with ripe berry fruit, mulchy earth and resiny flavors. Carob, vanilla and cocoa flavors control a syrupy finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Deep as a country well, with lush black plum and blackberry aromas as well as lead pencil and balsam wood. The palate is solid but not overly tough or complex, and the flavors of cassis, berry and black cherry are more than satisfying. A pure, textbook modern red wine; drinkable now and over the next couple of years.",Malbec
Argentina,"A touch leathery and cooked at first, but with time the bouquet deftly blends saucy, savory Syrah aromas with sun-baked black fruit notes. The palate is saturated and chunky, with aggressive sweet-and-sauvage flavors of grilled meats, spice and burnt brown sugar. Roasted, warm and mildly bitter on the finish. Drink now through 2012.",Syrah
Argentina,"Quite intense, with blasting aromas of blackberry, coconut, cocoa and even leather and horse hide. It's 65% Tannat and 35% Malbec, and as a whole it's big, grabby, tight and full of blackberry and raspberry flavors that bring an herbal twist. Smoky and herbal on the finish.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Dark in color, with aromas of coconut, leather, chocolate malt balls and generic black fruit. The wine is tannic and a little bit grating but generally in balance, with bold cassis, cherry and blackberry flavors. Not complex and seemingly made more for the everyday wine drinker than the collector.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A joint venture between the Renacer winery of Argentina and Chile and Allegrini from the Veneto in Italy. Thus it makes sense that this five-grape blend is done in the Amarone style, with concentrated, dried grapes. Aromas are generous, minty and floral, and the palate is jammy and concentrated. Rich and a little raisiny, just like Amarone. Drink now.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Syrupy and strange, with a lactic palate feel and cloying cherry fruit. Finishes bitter as well as candied.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Aromas of light raspberry and cookie dough are a bit sweet, but taken together they are attractive. The palate delivers snappy berry flavors and plenty of tannic kick. It loses a touch of focus as it opens but at $10 it offers more than enough quality.",Malbec
Argentina,"A nice step up from previous vintages; this affordable Syrah sports dark-fruit aromas and muscle, while the flavors veer toward jammy blackberry. Not a tannic, spicy, complex wine; instead it's easy as pie.",Syrah
Argentina,"A better overall ride than the more oaky Koch Cabernet, this bottling, aged 13 months in barrel, is crisp and fruity, with firm tannins that clamp down on the finish. Along the way there's bright raspberry and pie cherry flavors that are fresh albeit stark.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Blackberry, tar and other dark notes coat the masculine bouquet, while cherry and cassis work the palate. This is a solid, big wine with structure; it's also fairly tannic and hard. Has its merits; pretty full and rugged.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Tight, concentrated and deep, with rubbery aromas of black fruit and earth. The palate is rich and layered, with lemony oak setting up herbal, powerful berry fruit flavors that come with hints of tea and briar. Zesty as well as rich, and well balanced. Nicely done for Salta Syrah.",Syrah
Argentina,"Winemaker Silvio Alberto, working with consultant Michel Rolland, is clearly a proponent of the bigger-is-better school, and he deserves credit for making big wines that are balanced despite being brawny. This high-end Malbec, which is very reasonably priced, blasts with menthol, prune, chocolate and cassis. It's modern and chewy, but has enough tannin, acid and grit to keep it in fine form. Drink now through 2008. Imported by Kysela Pere et Fils.",Malbec
Argentina,"This jumpy, lively Malbec is a hulk that starts with funky aromas of wet dog and bacon before settling to reveal bold blackberry and plum notes. It's saturated and solid in the mouth, where black-fruit flavors dominate. On the finish comes spice and mocha. A full-force wine that needs time in the glass to show its best.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fairly dense on the nose, with aromas of coffee grounds, leather and beef stew along with berry fruit. The palate is true, with plum and brambly berry flavors. However, the feel is a bit choppy due to sharp acidity. A good blend that will do well with food.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A tiny bit heavy and soupy at first, but the palate brings things into perspective as it delivers sweet berry and spice flavors and only modest acids and tannins. It's a wine for now, with lasting jammy notes that are generally quite pleasant.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"Slightly brambly but otherwise dominated by strong red-fruit aromas and flavors. The palate is fairly rich and full, as it should be, with chocolate and herbal/pepper notes sneaking in. Doesn't have a lot of finish or sweetness. Pretty good mouthfeel and core acidity.",Malbec
Argentina,"For Argentine Sauvignon Blanc, Toso's version is nice. There's light green-apple aromas in front of green melon and grapefruit flavors. Finishes fairly full and grabby, with likable flavors. Not to be confused with Sancerre or anything, but solid.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"A typically huge Colomé wine with initial damp, murky, funky aromas that give way to earth, roasted fruit and compost. Fortunately it's fresher in the mouth, and the wine definitely improves with airing. Still, the palate is big and oily, with roasted berry, herb and wild, exotic flavors. A unique style of Malbec from old Calchaquí vines.",Malbec
Argentina,"Potent smelling, with black pepper, lots of oak and true berry fruit aromas. The palate is a bit pointed and high in acidity, while the flavors of raspberry, currants and red plum are solid. Finishes a little jagged and acidic, but at worst that staunch acidity will keep it alive for years to come. Hold until at least 2011.",Malbec
Argentina,"The nose displays some tree bark and sawmill, but underneath there's savory spice alongside black fruit. The palate is ripe and deep, with berry essence and clove. Dark chocolate carries the finish, which is firmly tannic but not overly hard.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tannat by nature is a hard, brooding grape, and this version from northern Argentina's Salta region is funky, with olive, horse hide and plenty of dark-fruit aromas and flavors. The palate is leathery but proportioned, with spice and length. Could use a touch more cushion, but hey, that's Tannat.",Tannat
Argentina,"You don't see much South American Tannat outside Uruguay, but this one scores points for its dark charcoal and cola nose as well as its deep black cherry and plum flavors. Yes, it's kind of hard and tannic, but it's also got some verve and length to it. With meat, it would be worth the gamble.",Tannat
Argentina,"Nicely put together, with a solid blend of spice, leather and smoked meat vying with juicy berry aromas. The palate is tangy and fresh, with flashy cherry flavors. Finishes strong, with coffee and chocolate. A good wine for the money; recommended for everyday Shiraz.",Shiraz
Argentina,"A full-octane wine with notes of olive and berry on the bouquet. It runs bright in the mouth, with zippy cherry and cassis flavors. Later on you detect olive at the core, but that's admirably covered by a blanket of fine oak. Good in its class.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Freixenet, the big cava producer from Catalonia, Spain, has entered Argentina via this cutely named winery. The wine, however, is pretty much your standard-fare Malbec. The nose and palate are fruity and bold, while the finish offers spice and coffee. Good but not up to the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"This funky Argentinean Pinot pours on the rubber, turned earth and heavy fruit aromas, and then backs them up with a full, meaty, starchy palate that's loaded with dry cherry and red-pepper flavors. A robust, grabby wine with virtues and question marks.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Fairly smooth and berry dominated, with almost rubbery fruit flavors that are at once tangy and satisfying. In terms of mouthfeel it's a bit hard and tannic, especially given the depth of fruit. But the flavors and intensity are there.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Very big and brawny is this single-vineyard, new-to-the-market Malbec from grower Jose Blanco. Expect lots of fresh-cut cinnamon on the nose along with leather, earth and gum. Heavy but balanced, with big tannins wrapped in plenty of coconut and mint. Takes a while to grasp; it's a giant with huge fruit and some clumsiness. Better from 2007–2009. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Malbec
Argentina,"A nice wine with aromas of lead pencil, violets, black fruit and a sprinkling of lemon zest. The palate has body and a chunky outlook, while the flavors of berry fruits, spice and something slightly exotic work. A solid, approachable wine that should bring a smile to the face of any Malbec lover.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dynamite Malbec from the Renacer family that's behind the emerging Punto Final label. This is a monumental effort with 24 months of French oak aging. What you get is quality from head to toe, with pure and unyielding flavors backed by a big wave of tannins. Will age for several more years, and by then this rock's power may have settled down a little. 275 cases produced.",Malbec
Argentina,"Anyone looking for a whole lot of wine for not too much cash will be pleased with this blend, named for former Argentinean president Juan Perón, husband of Evita. Back to the wine: it's rich, heady and borderline opulent, with ripe tannins, plumpness and hedonistic fruit. Incorporates 10% Cabernet and 5% Syrah. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Malbec
Argentina,"From the beginning you can tell that this Bordeaux-style blend has the requisite components to make the grade. The bouquet offers baking spices, berry and vanilla in large doses, while the palate is ample, fresh and fairly racy. Nothing dull or clumsy here; it's a balanced, structured wine with aging ability. Drink now or hold through 2009. Imported by Kysela Père et Fils.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Pitch dark in color, with a huge, oaky/earthy nose that cuddles deep black-plum fruit. Ultraripe and modern in style, with mounds of plum and blackberry flavors. Toasty and minty on the round finish. This is one rich wine; a massive improvement over the 2000 vintage, the last Altimus we rated. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Varietally floral, with spice, tropical fruit and citrus on the nose. Clean and wispy on the palate, with touches of lemon extract, banana and pineapple. A zesty, easy white wine; best as an apéritif.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Black cherry, citrus peel and a touch of charcoal and grilled meat make for a solid nose. Ripe blackberry and dark plum work the palate, while coffee, licorice and spice grace the firm, grabby, mildly tannic finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Good but a step down from recent vintages. Big and brawny on the nose, with oak-based aromas of shoe polish, chocolate mint chips and mocha. The thick palate is deep, raisiny and chunky, with roasted black fruit flavors touched up by chocolate. Very good and likable, but not as thorough and alluring as it has been. 40% Malbec with 30% each Cabernet and Merlot.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Dark, piercing, crusty black fruit aromas suggest burnt toast and lemon, and although there's a lemony bite to the palate, once it airs out chunky black fruit flavors take over. Not a thriller but it's pure and clean. Textbook mid-to-upper-level Malbec with some flair.",Malbec
Argentina,"The price on this perennial bargain brand from Valentin Bianchi has crept up in recent years, and thus its value potential has stalled somewhat. But it's still a fruity number that once it opens and settles delivers jammy aromas and solid red-berry flavors. We like that it's neither candied nor weedy. 60,000 cases proves that good wine can be made in quantity.",Malbec
Argentina,"An entirely different breed. The nose hints strongly at bacon and spice, but it also weaves in subtle red-fruit notes. Out of the ordinary on the palate, too, where cherry flavors are light but savory. A touch odd and slick, but good because it's not standard.",Malbec
Argentina,"There's no other way to put it: Perdriel from Norton is one of Argentina's best high-end blends. It's rich and extracted, but still carries that just-right mix of preserving acidity, structured tannins and dynamite fruit. Opens with chocolate and berry marmalade, and then effortlessly transitions to flavors of cassis, blackberry and fudge. Touches of prune, leather and coffee grace the meaty, substantive finish. 500 cases made.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Starts with rubbery, intense aromas, but with breathing it settles on earthy berry fruit and oak-driven coffee. The mouthfeel is good and shows nice lemony acids, while the flavors vascillate between tangy/floral and herbal blackberry. Sweet, concentrated and rich on the finish, with a lasting wave of mocha.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sweet and candied on the nose, almost like a jelly doughnut at first. But with airing it turns more savory, herbal and dry. Flavors of tomato, raspberry and herbs are robust and interesting, while the finish is less so as it flattens out and seems baked. Very good but needing a bit more spunk to rate higher.",Syrah
Argentina,"The polar opposite of boring, this lovely blend offers aromas of mint, herbs, flower petals and sandalwood. The palate, meanwhile, is all about pure, robust blackberry and plum. It's a chunky, rich wine with a bit of burnt toast on the lusty finish. Thorough and textured. A bona fide winner. Imported by Billington Imports.",Malbec-Merlot
Argentina,"After an earthy, aggressive, almost sweaty start, this joint-venture red from Nicolas Catena and Eric de Rothschild finds its course and manages to improve. The palate is full of acid-driven, amplified cherry and plum flavors, and while there's a hint of buttery oak resting on the finish, that should subside with airing and a good food pairing. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"is one way to describe this Cabernet-Malbec blend. The bouquet is full of smoky balsam wood, leather and solid berry fruit, while the palate is both juicy and plentiful as it pushes equal amounts of bold black fruit and warming oak. A very solid Argentinean icon wine with impeccable structure and liveliness. Better in 2008.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"Ripe, bulky and fruity, with simple, granular aromas. The mouthfeel is full and warm, but generally speaking the balance is where it's supposed to be. Smooth and chocolaty across the palate and onto the finish. Shows power and density.",Syrah
Argentina,"Aromas of melon and baby powder are light but attractive, while the peach and citrus flavors are wet, zesty and fresh. Finishes with dried-fruit flavors and a sprinkle of minerality. Commendable for its simplicity.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Light strawberry aromas lead the way, with a touch of almond candy as background. The palate is fruity but nondescript, with tangy acidity and good mouthfeel. This is a perfectly competent rosé, especially for Argentina, which isn't really known for the style.",Rosé
Argentina,"Quite basic and innocuous. The nose offers simple berry and plum, but nothing exciting. The palate is earthy, fruity and solid; but again, nothing out of the ordinary. And it's short on the finish. Good but leaves you wanting more.",Malbec
Argentina,"Consistency in the wine world is a virtue, and Cheval covers the consistency issue with ease. Aromas of earth, mushroom, leather and so forth add an Old World touch to this New World Malbec-Cabernet blend. It's healthy and even juicy on the palate, with blackberry, dark plum and tobacco flavors. An interesting wine that grabs and holds your attention. Drink now through 2012.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Year by year, Salentein's top wines are improving. Primum is truly a fine wine, right up there with the country's best. It's harmonious and inviting, with cola, mineral, floral notes and honest black fruit aromas and flavors. The feel is secure and tight but also well balanced, with a touch of molasses but mostly just deep, driving black fruit. Muscular, intense and long on the finish. Drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rock solid, clean and composed. For the past several years this Malbec-Merlot-Cabernet blend has been an Argentine flag-bearer, and the '05 is as good as past vintages. Look for bold berry flavors accented by medicinal, herbal notes. And then comes a finish that's chewy and round. This is like a fat fastball in the proverbial wheel house; just see it and swing away.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Until now all we've tried are Callia's basic $9 varietals. So this is a big step up in intention, price and power. The bouquet is compact and sweet, with coconut, juniper and foresty aromas. Fresh and slightly grating on the palate, with spunky raspberry and cocoa. Turns more raw and rough as it expands, but overall we like this blend of Shiraz, Tannat, Malbec and Merlot.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A little sweet and candied on the nose but there are also floral aromas that are alluring. The palate is plump but offers good balance and structure, while the flavors run toward beefy dark berry fruit, spice and chocolate. Long, deep and roasted on the finish. Quite good for ten bucks.",Malbec
Argentina,"This Malbec is easy, ripe, stylish and 100% attractive. The plump black fruit is distinguished and solid, while the mouthfeel is tight yet proper, with good tannic structure and pulsing acidity. Drink now through 2008. Imported by Winesellers Ltd.",Malbec
Argentina,"Spicy and woody at first, with tons of black fruit. The nose shows a hint of dill, but for the most part the wine's pure and full of plum, blackberry, vanilla and good tannins. Firm and loaded, with cola on the finish. Yet another success in Trapiche's new line of old-vine, single-vineyard Malbecs. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Malbec
Argentina,"Jumpy and leathery at first, although time in the glass settles it down. The palate offers blackberry as the lead flavor, although there's some lemon peel and citrus in the background. Finishes simple and short.",Malbec
Argentina,"Argentinean Tempranillo is a slippery slope, as evidenced by this mossy, olive-ridden red that has its moments as well as its faults. Positives include a nice spice element and good intentions. But beware of the herbal flavors and rock-hard mouthfeel.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Fairly earthy and stewy, but not too baked to suffer. The palate is expectedly chunky and meaty, with full-weight dark fruits and some rooty depth. Fairly easygoing and likable, but a tad muddled.",Malbec
Argentina,"Basic but full and ripe, with black cherry and cassis aromas. The palate has some snap and clack to it, but flavors of raspberry are softened and enriched by vanilla and creamy accents. Shows more on the nose than in the mouth, but overall it is a nice wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Ripe and cushy, with deeply defined fruit aromas that carry enough soft touches to make you want to dig in. Delicate but daring on the palate, with chocolate notes darkening the cassis and cherry flavors. Very round and exceedingly mouthfilling. Imported by Kysela Père et Fils.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Gets going with aromas of molasses, black olive and pencil lead, which accent the rich black fruit that's prominently on display. Intense in the mouth, where dark plum and black cherry dominate. The mouthfeel is ripe and warm, and the finishing notes of licorice, chocolate and coffee are sturdy and refined. Imported by Tastings Import Company.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"A bit of marmalade and violets accent the bold, dark nose. Not at all subtle, with syrupy berry flavors offset by a whack of bitter chocolate. Full-bodied, with chewy tannins and plenty of oak on the finish. A ripe, untamed, candied wine that will settle with more bottle age. Imported by Dourthe USA.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Starts out with bubble gum and sweet candy aromas, which are followed by black cherry flavors. Seems a little hard and grating at first, although airing does open it up. Ultimately it's a basic Malbec with good flavors and adequate mouthfeel.",Malbec
Argentina,"Robust red wine, with ever-changing aromas of earth, leather, baked fruit and more. Shows glimpses of complexity amid standard, chunky Malbec flavors of plum and blackberry.",Malbec
Argentina,"Part of the fun of exploring Argentine Malbec is tasting all the new kids on the block. Having not seen Guentota before, all signs point to high quality. The bouquet is dark, with accents of cola, mineral and burnt toast giving it a masculine edge. Round, plump and full in the mouth, with cherry, berry and cassis flavors. A total package of a wine, with character, nuance and serious base-level fruit.",Malbec
Argentina,"A bit warm and ripe at 15.5%, but the nose of prune, raisin and blackberry is rich and only gets better with airing. The palate features tobacco and savory black fruit, and the finish runs for miles with chocolate and licorice. Despite its weight, there appears to be ample acidity to protect the wine's integrity. A blend of 75% Malbec and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Kaiken Ultra has emerged as a consistent top-shelf Malbec. This vintage shows power, purity, mineral, ripe fruit and well-applied oak. It's a generous wine with kirsch and raspberry parfait flavors. It almost makes it to creamy but by holding onto its core acidity it guards overall balance. Unforced but a little forceful; good for those who like a ripe, meaty red wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"There's a mix of good and questionable here. The nose starts out gaseous and stinky, as if it's begging for air. Give it time and it settles on exotic, warm blueberry and floral aromas. The palate is downright syrupy and thick, with licorice, bitter chocolate and sweet berry flavors. Rich as they come but also soft and on the brink of overripe. Not a wine for the cellar.",Malbec
Argentina,"Like many Cafayate reds of stature, this opens with funky murkiness, leather, animal notes and baked characteristics. The blend is 70% Tannat with Malbec and Syrah, and overall it's full-bodied, snappy in the mouth, and good in terms of offering integrated plum, raspberry and spice flavors. Shows a lot of heat and burn on the finish, however. A wine with individuality. Drink now through 2012.",Red Blend
Argentina,"This is probably the best of the new line of Festivo wines from Monteviejo. The nose has a clean, fresh neutrality that serves it well, while the palate is bright and offers apricot and nectarine flavors. Turns more pithy on the finish, which is why we suggest that you drink it ASAP. Questionable value at $18.",Rosé
Argentina,"Nice color and plenty of fruit on the nose add up to a welcome mat. The palate deals berry fruit galore, especially raspberry, cassis and black cherry. Juicy but still a little plump on the finish, with overall balance equal to that of a dancer. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"The bouquet on this bold red amounts to one big blast of fruit, nothing more or less. The palate matches the nose, with black plum, blueberry and cola flavors. Broad in the mouth and fiercely tannic. Spirited but a little untamed.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Year after year I taste this wine, and it always seems oaky and short on fruit. That said, it's a balanced, serious wine from well-tended vines, and it's made by folks who care. If you take the plunge, look for coconut and vanilla from the oak and dry fruit with touches of tomato and herbs.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Light up front, with slight floral and banana aromas. Flavors of lemon and apple are short and clean, while a tangy finish closes it out. Fairly big for Torrontes but not offering much in the way of character.",Torrontés
Argentina,"This rosado is made from Bonarda and Malbec grapes. It's a touch vegetal on the nose, with hints of vanilla to sweeten it up. The palate is tart and dry, with peach, nectarine and apple flavors. Decent feel and body keep it afloat.",Rosé
Argentina,"Simple earth, rubber and berry aromas come prior to cranberry, plum and cherry flavors. Finishes quickly, with drying tannins. A tight, limited wine that won't offend or excite.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A typical New World Chardonnay in that it starts with corny aromas that are matched by heavy toast notes. Act two is an ultra sweet palate that seems more sugary than ideal. Very tropical as well, with sweet mango and pineapple flavors. Too sweet to be convincing as a dry white.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Lightly waxy, with inoffensive but innocuous floral aromas. The palate shows citrus candy and weight, while the finish is more or less the same. Registers as a pulpy, chunky white as opposed to something lithe and snappy.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Slightly oily, nutty and harsh on the initial nose, but better as it opens and airs out. The body here is good and has balance, depth and substance, and the flavors of lychee, mango and other tropical fruits ring true. Persistent on the finsh, with good structure and length.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Concentrated, with plenty of aromatic richness and dark fruit aromas of blackberry and cassis. The palate features proper extraction and weight, with forceful, powered-up flavors of wild berry and toast. Solid on the finish, with good ending weight and legs.",Malbec
Argentina,"For a lighter-bodied wine, this sure shows a lot of aggressive, resiny oak. The nose has sawmill qualities, while the palate is woody and spicy, with apple in the background. Seemed better in 2004; wasn't nearly as oaky.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A wine that's seriously muscled up with tannin and oak. That's what you get with this rugged Argentinean Cabernet that comes with leafy notes of tobacco and mint along with raspy, grippy berry fruit. Maybe another year in bottle will help; now it's not that pleasant.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Scattershot aromas of wet paint and berries are the opening salvo. Acid-based red fruit carries the palate, while the mouthfeel is electric to the point of overbearing. Tastes alright but doesn't have the cuddly feel or lushness that's the signature of a good Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Starts with aromas of strawberry and raspberry, but to be honest they're a touch green and grassy. On the palate, there's plum and chocolate, and late in the game it's all about milk chocolate. Not complex but decent.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dry and toasty on the nose, but tart, racy and raspy on the palate. The raspberry and cherry flavors are sharp and fall off to dry and lean as the wine progresses.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Pungent grapefruit aromas carry the aggressive yet fragile nose. Sheer and citric in the mouth, with sharp lemon-lime flavors. Zesty almost to the point of scouring.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"A bit grapey and jammy on the nose, with a slight hint of bramble and stem. It's solid in the mouth, with kick and sweet berry fruit flavors. On the finish it falls off some, leaving a mildly candied aftertaste. Not perfect but overall it's a well-made blend of 85% Malbec with Cab and Syrah filling things out.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Ripeness is apparent from the first whiff of blackberry and prune. Yet the palate features tangy flavors that lead straight to a rubbery, almost bouncy finish. Full for sure but not very polished.",Bonarda
Argentina,A gold-colored heavy wine with butterscotch and apricot aromas followed by a tangy palate that features a beam of acidity running through the middle. Remains tangy and narrow through the finish.,Chardonnay
Argentina,"Not a lot of ambience to talk about. The nose is almost peanutty in its murkiness, while the flavors of cherry, burnt toast and green pepper are less than impressive. Not an overly bad wine; it just fails to impress at any juncture.",Malbec
Argentina,"Modest, unfocused tangerine and passion fruit aromas lead to a plump, flat palate with dried apricot and passion fruit flavors. Seems soft on the finish, as if the acidity is low.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Foresty and damp on the nose, with just a touch of standard red fruit propping things up. Runs leafy and dry in the mouth, with a hard, almost bitter finish. Too tough and tannic to really enjoy.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Gets out of the blocks with grassy, almost murky aromas. The palate is loaded with clipped, pinched fruit that's overly acidic and leaves a harsh impression on the cheeks and tongue. A wine that needs better balance and more.",Malbec
Argentina,"A lot of funk on the nose, and it never really goes away. Aromas of burnt coffee, sulfur and charred meat are less than attractive, while the palate runs weedy. Just too shaky and off to rate better.",Malbec
Argentina,"Mint and tomato blend with red fruit on the nose. The palate is tight and tannic, with limited cherry and cassis flavors. Finishes dry and blanched, with little to offer.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"In general, we've been liking Bosca's wines. But this Cabernet is murky and tomatoey, with too much stagnant character to earn a better score. Not really up to par.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Hard and spiky on the nose, and not a whole lot better in the mouth. The flavors are tart and juicy, while the lean finish is ultratangy and sharp.",Malbec
Argentina,"The color and aromas stir intrigue, but the brutally sharp palate that runs on steam-roller acidity does it no favors. Succulent to the point of sour, and giant to the point of overdone, this wine needs to head back to the garage for a tune-up.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Smells lifeless, with mild bitterness and banana flavors. Sort of waxy on the finish, despite sharp acidity. Not as good as the winery's basic Torrontes.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Aromas of mocha, rubber, smoky leather and berry fruit indicate good things to come, but in the mouth this wine fails to deliver equal to its price and the previous successes of Trapiche's single-vineyard Malbec project. Scouring acidity is the main culprit; the wine seems clipped, tartaric and angular, thus it's all superficial and not deep or rich enough to rate better.",Malbec
Argentina,"Initially it gives off murky, soupy aromas. But with airing it rounds into form, displaying prune and oak scents in front of a round, soft, stewy palate of chunky berry flavors. Gets better with time before finishing with toast, herbal notes and tobacco. Offers more highs than lows.",Merlot
Argentina,"For some time now this wine has been the measuring stick for Argentine Viognier, and the '05 vintage is one of the best yet. Mineral, melon and peaches coat the bouquet, while the balanced palate is full of sweet melon flavors. This is a warm, ripe, slightly creamy wine that's meant to be drunk as soon as possible, before it loses steam. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Viognier
Argentina,"Broquel is Trapiche's higher-end label, and generally speaking this Chardonnay is one of the best Argentineans going. Yes, there's a heavy dose of wood, but with time it meshes nicely into the apple, melon and citrus fruit that's prominently on display. Pure on the finish, with forward acidity. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"The color is a rich gold hue, while the nose offers a collection of apple, cinnamon, mineral and toast. This is a full-bodied and well-made wine, with baked-fruit flavors offset by spice and white pepper. Then it finishes creamy and sweet, highlighting toffee, caramel and vanilla. With proper weight and acids, it's balanced. Imported by Kysela Père et Fils.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Tropical and zesty on the nose, with a big shot of lemon blossom and a secondary note of melon. The palate is juicy, fresh and sort of lean, with lemon, pineapple and green apple flavors. Arguably tart and angular, but at least it's clean and crisp.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"This vintage of Broquel reflects the cool, challenged characteristics of the '08 vintage. It has snap and berry aromas and flavors along with obvious oak, char and mocha. The palate is more driving and linear than previous years, with juicy, snappy cherry and wood at the base. Finishes with coffee, toast and controlled bitterness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tropical and toasty, with buttercup and banana on the nose. Good acidity keeps the palate zesty and moving forward, while the flavors of lemon, lime and pineapple are juicy and clean. Good in a fresh and simple way, with just a spot of oak character.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Borderline heavy, with stewy black fruit aromas that turn savory then murky and gaseous. The palate has clacky acidity and flavors of sweet, roasted berry fruits. Lasting on the finish, with citric acidity that seems as though it was forced onto the wine. 50% Malbec with 30% Cabernet and 10% each Syrah and Merlot.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Smooth and ripe, with a sweet, doughy character to the nose. Ripe, lush and healthy, with cassis and chocolate oozing off the palate. For the money this is rock-solid Malbec, saturated and chewy, with ample tannins. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Malbec
Argentina,"Familiar aromas of lemon blossom and air freshener get it going, and all together it smells a lot like a bathroom cleanser. Later on it shifts to lean, lemony, citrus fruits, with lime sticking out. Good and racy in the mouth, with another squeeze of lime juice on the finish. Good for Torrontés but with limits.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Savory, baked cassis and blackberry aromas show form and solidity, while the palate is deep and a little soft, with lush, slightly roasted berry and black currant aromas. Chocolaty on the finish yet not too heavy or forced. Not all that Syrah-like but it still smells and tastes good.",Syrah
Argentina,"Big and ripe, with chewy fruit and a lot of plum and blackberry character. At 15.3% it hides its alcohol amid berry, cassis and black-pepper flavors. Modern in style, with tannin and texture. Very nice and fairly natural despite its heft.",Merlot
Argentina,"Earthy and ripe, with lots of black cherry and raspberry on both the bouquet and palate. Comes on equally juicy and smooth, with good length on the back end and plenty of acidity to push the flavor. Balanced and on the money. Imported by Stanza.",Malbec
Argentina,"Bright boysenberry aromas offer a touch of sugar beet and perfume, while the palate is all about jammy berry flavors with dark, lush shadings. Firm on the finish, with no holes to speak of. Undeniably ripe, with a good feel and plenty of richness. Imported by The Global Vineyard.",Malbec
Argentina,"Not all that expressive on the nose; about all you get is basic yellow fruit and lettuce. The palate shows more intensity, but the flavors of lemon and tropical fruits are basic at best. Chunky, sweet and common on the finish. Good for Argentina but still it leaves you asking for more.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"With its vanilla and caramel accents on pure pear and apple fruit, this is a good, basic Argentinean Chard. The palate is clean and forward, with solid apple forming the framework. Shows just enough butter and toast to warm it up, but it's not a heavy wine. Smooth and easy. Imported by Winesellers Ltd.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Dry and bit herbal, with red-fruit aromas and a spot of green. The palate deals good red-berry flavor with accents of black pepper and vanilla. Persistent on the finish, with moderate tannic grab. Streamlined but not what you'd call thin. Imported by Broadbent Selections, Inc.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Not sure why a Mendoza Malbec is named Havana Rose, but that's not really important when you taste this ripe, candied wine that shows reasonable balance and character. The palate offers bright, candied raspberry and sweet plum flavors, and the finish is warm and full. About all you can ask for in a $9 wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big, fragrant, lightly oily and tropical, with zingy, lively acidity pushing lemon and green melon flavors. The finish is round, a little pithy and solid, and overall this strikes us being the quintessential quaffing white for the summer and early fall.",Torrontés
Argentina,"This new casual wine from Valentin Bianchi is solid with full berry aromas. The palate is round and a little soft and plump, with prune, fig and blackberry flavors. Sweet and easy throughout, with a mild finish. Nothing out of the ordinary.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"For Argentine PG it's attractive. The nose is clean but simple, while the palate is fresh and easy, with driving pineapple and lemon flavors being pushed along by good acidity. Juicy and wet on the finish, and overall it ranks as a nice, fruity wash.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"A balanced Malbec with red fruit aromas and just a touch of aged cheese on the nose. The palate is creamy and slightly candied, with layered black fruit, fig and chocolate flavors. Creamy and candied but lively on the finish, with enough integrity and structure to rank as a Best Buy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Granular, raisiny and heavy on the nose, with jammy blackberry aromas. The palate then hits with a thud; it's chunky and low in acidity, which yields a thick flavor set of prune and coffee. Better once it breathes, but it's still a bit too sticky and syrupy for our liking.",Malbec
Argentina,"This blend from the Nicasia and Adrianna vineyards is the best Malbec on the market today. There's raisin, mineral, licorice, blackberry and more. The mouth is like a Mack truck on ice skates, meaning it's both huge and elegant. And the mile-long finish of coffee, mocha and molten black fruit is awesome. Drink now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"Features intoxicating pastry, blueberry, cola and coffee aromas in front of a minerally, terroir-packed palate of soft black fruit, chocolate, fine herbs and other character-aiding touches. The mouthfeel is fabulous and the finish of Swiss chocolate and integrated spice is as smooth as silk. Drink now through 2011.",Malbec
Argentina,"Catena's signature wine is Cabernet Sauvignon-based, and it's a purple haze of dense, exotic aromas that lean toward lavender, flower petals and black fruit. It's saturated and fruity to the point of no return, with impeccable structure and mouthfeel. An avalanche of flavor and style. Drink now through 2015.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"Starts with roasted, heavy aromas of rubber, prune, shoe polish and toasted wood. The palate shows pretty good texture along with flavors of blackberry, herbs and prune. Solid but basic, with minimal complexity and depth.",Merlot
Argentina,"A little stewy on the nose, with vanilla, liqueur and roasted berry aromas. The palate is young and vibrant, arguably teetering on sharp, with piercing cherry flavors and lots of oak. Flavorful but rough, with burnt brown sugar on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Round, dark and slightly baked on the nose, with quasi-syrupy and creamy berry flavors that have plenty of the label's “oak cask” character. The finish is endowed with mocha and toast, and overall it's your textbook, good, regular Malbec from Argentina.",Malbec
Argentina,"Earthy up front, with a heavy, mildly herbal set of berry aromas. The palate is juicy and fairly solid, with fresh red-berry flavors accented by a dose of creamy vanilla. Long on the finish for basic Merlot, with an herbal lasting impression.",Merlot
Argentina,"Adrianna is a higher-elevation, higher-acid single-vineyard Malbec, and it's a component of the otherworldly Argentino blend. On its own, it's fresh, healthy and sturdy. The nose offers smoky, jerky, rubber and black-fruit aromas, which are backed by exotic herb, plum and boysenberry flavors. Firm, delicious and finely structured. Drink now through 2012.",Malbec
Argentina,"Deep purple in color and rich on the nose, with bacon, roasted berry, rubber, spice and heft. The palate is thick and round, with smooth edges and flavors of bacon grease and roasted black fruits. Sweet and spicy late, with a lasting flavor of savory barbecue. Hard to peg as Cabernet Sauvignon but not a bad wine if you like yours lusty and rich.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Floral and tropical aromas are a direct reflection of the 75% Torrontés in the blend. There's also lychee, another Torrontés byproduct. Otherwise, it's lean and tangy, with tangerine, lychee and green melon flavors. The more it opens the more it smells like a kitchen cleanser. But the forwardness and snap are admirable. Contains 15% Viognier and 10% Chardonnay.",White Blend
Argentina,"Big, roasted and full, with slightly earthy, burnt aromas to go with standard berry fruit. The palate is solid in feel, with herbal berry and tea flavors along with zesty acidity. Finishes toasty and a little herbal, with any leftover fruit heading quickly to the shadows.",Malbec
Argentina,"About five years into its existence and Colomé has found its groove in this excellent, luscious Malbec-Cabernet blend. The bouquet is exotic and savory, with classic dark-fruit aromas, spice, cocoa and more. Big on the palate, with cassis, wild berry and chocolate flavors, and the finish is big, ripe and sturdy. Good now through 2013.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Inky dark and an outstanding example of high-end Malbec. This is the finest Alta we've tried; it is ripe as can be but not raisiny. The palate is creamy and lush, but with good acidic balance. And the flavors of black fruits, chocolate and spice make it a league-leader. Drink now through 2012.",Malbec
Argentina,"The nose is dusty and inviting, with notes of spiced berries, molasses, sandalwood and artisan soap. Very saturated but well balanced, with a creamy, oily mouthfeel and sweet, generous flavors of plum, blackberry and chocolate. Mellow and delicious from start to finish, and a winner even at this high price.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Unus is 70% Malbec and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, but what you need to know is that it's 100% excellent. The nose features a rich blend of tobacco, baked plum and leather, while the palate is saturated, concentrated and tastes of cassis and blackberry. Clean, intense and complex",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"An unusual blend of Riesling, Albariño and Sauvignon Blanc that is largely neutral on the nose and then waxy, honeyed and pithy in the mouth. Along the way there's an appealing dry, melony, petrol character and some good old-fashioned tang. A breed unto itself.",White Blend
Argentina,"Starts out with nice aromas of ripe black fruits and toasty oak, however it drops down in class in the mouth, where pointed, jabby acidity causes tang and sourness. There are good berry and plum flavors to offset the tartness, but it finishes narrow and snappy. Pretty good but needs better balance and structure.",Malbec
Argentina,"On one hand you'll find bacon, rubber and smoke aromas, but on the other there's stem and murky notes that bring it down. The palate has sharp acidity and flavors of roasted red berries and pepper. For a Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend, it seems lean, stemmy and wanting.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A touch stemmy on the nose, but in the mouth it comes around. The flavors are in the plump, pithy zone (think orange rind and grapefruit peel), while the finish is zesty but also pithy. Registers as your typical full-styled Malbec rosé that is o.k. on its best day.",Rosé
Argentina,"Fairly brambly and a little sour on the bouquet, with prickly fruit aromas. The palate is just as sharp and angular, without much cushion to fall back on. Flavors of cherry and raspberry are slightly herbal and tart, while the finish is more of the same. Not as round and ripe as you'd expect for an $18 Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Monteviejo, one of the Clos de los Siete wineries, has entered the unofficial “fun Malbec” category with Festivo, which has a stemmy, slightly burnt character that is present from start to finish. Along the way there are leathery black fruit flavors, herbal qualities and a good mouthfeel. Decent wine but decidedly herbal and stemmy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Starts with jammy, dusty, simple aromas of raspberry and strawberry. The palate has both a juicy front edge but also a creamy middle that houses lactic-tasting pie cherry and strawberry flavors. Regular stuff for simple sipping, nothing more.",Malbec
Argentina,"Simple and peachy, with a mix of sweet and citric flavors. Tastes candied and tropical, with banana coming onto the finish along with orange and pineapple. A lot of fruit and flavor; just not much sophistication. A quaffer, pure and simple.",White Blend
Argentina,"Dark as night, with a rich, round, deep nose. Overt on the palate, with cherry, blackberry and plum. Juicy enough, with chewy tannins and firm acidity. Beefy enough to match with any meat and dark enough to substitute for paint. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Malbec
Argentina,"Ripe and plummy, with blackberry on the inviting nose. Sizable on the palate, with raspberry and cassis in spades. Wholesome and nice, with no noticeable flaws. Good, affordable Cabernet doesn't come around every day, but this is an exception to the rule. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Quite good for the money, with mild coconut and caramel aromas on top of berry fruit. The palate is ripe and sweet, with cinnamon, chocolate and coffee notes mingling with berries and currants. Shows the slightest hint of grass at the core but overall it's very good. Imported by Victoire Imports.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Ripe, tight and fresh, this is what everyday Merlot should be like. There's some roast meat and leather atop cherry on the nose, and behind that there's black fruit, leather, bacon and pepper flavors. A totally legitimate table wine for a good price.",Merlot
Argentina,"Spicy and alluring, with molasses, earth and barbecue on the nose. Bold blackberry, plum and cough syrup work the palate, while the finish is tannic and firm. Not particularly plush, but lively and tasty. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Smells a lot like fresh celery and/or asparagus, with vibrant green fruit aromas and lettuce thrown in for good measure. Juicy in the mouth, with apple, citrus and green veggie flavors. Turns more vegetal the longer it goes, but freshness and acidity keep it on a solid plane.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"A little out there on a limb, with ultra-tropical aromas and limited flavors. It starts out fine in the mouth, and then come basic citrus, sweet pineapple and melon flavors. Tastes a lot like powdered sugar on the finish, but lasting acidity manages to cut through the candied sweetness.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Light on the nose, with modest peach and apple. Apple, pineapple and a touch of toast carry the palate, which is clean and acid-based. Arguably a touch sweet, but overall it's a good South American Chardonnay. Imported by Tastings Import Company.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A bit of burnt character clouds the grapy nose, but it's not a heavy, overoaked wine. In fact, the palate is a touch tangy, with zesty black cherry and a decent amount of protruding acidity. Rigid but solid, with full fruit flavors. Imported by Epic Wines.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is a traditional-styled Malbec, one with leaner cherry and raspberry fruit as opposed to heavy blackberry. It's a bit racy and acidic, but it's stylish as well. Big enough to satisfy but complex enough to intrigue. Imported by Dylain Produce, LLC.",Malbec
Argentina,"This Malbec-Tempranillo blend is trying to be one of those new-wave super bruisers and it achieves that goal, but only to a point. It's big, round, savory and lush, but it's shallow in the midsection because it lacks acidity and punch. Beefy but incomplete. Imported by Winesellers Ltd.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Smoky and sultry smelling, with berry jam aromas and ample subtleties. The palate is tannic and lively, like a good, masculine youngster should be. And the flavors of raspberry and plum are vivid and smack hard against the inside of your cheeks. Could use a year, but it's drinkable now with steak.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Sometimes price is not indicative of a wine's overall quality, and this appears to be a case in point. The nose is dry, cheesy and overly oaked, and the palate is downright screeching with acidity, so much so that there's a sour flavor and scour to both the palate and finish. Too much tartaric acid? You bet!",Malbec
Argentina,"Like many of this winery's bottlings, this is heavy and raisiny. However, amid all the thickness and extract there are lusty, robust roasted black fruit flavors and candied darkness. Baked on the finish, which feels hollow and doesn't last long.",Syrah
Argentina,"Piercing leather, berry and foresty aromas lead to a zesty palate of medicinal cherry and raspberry flavors. The acidity here is high, and so there's some tartness and scour to the palate and finish. Tastes pretty good but rides rough and bumpy.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Heady and well choreographed, with roasted sweet aromas to get things going. Some char and weight appear next, setting up solid cherry and blackberry flavors. Juicy, ripe and structured. An unusual blend that works nicely. Imported by Billington Imports.",Malbec-Syrah
Argentina,"Peach, melon and apple carry the clean but ordinary bouquet, and behind that comes a round palate full of ripe banana, pear, caramel and vanilla. Fully oaked but not overdone, with toast on the finish. Good Argentine Chardonnay. Imported by Billington Imports.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Very oaky, with a can't-miss scent of butter, and also some maple. Sweet and syrupy on first take but then it settles down to deliver licorice, cooked brown sugar and toast. What's best about this wine is its feel.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Hands down, this is the finest Pinot Noir from South America that I've ever tasted, and that includes Chile, Argentina and anyplace else. Italy's Piero Incisa della Rocchetta of Sassicaia fame started this project in 2004, and it's now finding a groove. This wine is as elegant as Burgundy but as full of flavor as something from California. The color is rosy, the aromas beguiling, and the meeting of oak and fruit just perfect. Terrific for contemplating on its own or with food. Versatility should be its middle name.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Big and fruity, with notes of rubber and graphite on the bouquet. Textured and pretty full-bodied, the berry, cassis and pepper flavors come across as dedicated and real. Kind of short and basic on the finish, but by then it has made its point.",Merlot
Argentina,"Aromas of pithy citrus and pineapple are decent but unrefined, while flavors of tangerine and pineapple are tropical, zesty and what they are. This is nothing more than a fresh, simple, citrusy white to sip on the patio. Anything beyond that would be stretching it.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Generic to the max, with simple white fruit and lettuce aromas. The feel is wet and juicy but nothing more, with simple green fruit flavors of melon, apple and kiwi. Bland but decent if well chilled.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Harsh and less than clear on the nose despite a lack of oak. The palate is pithy and hot, with bitter apple and apricot flavors in front of a similarly pithy finish that brings banana into the fold. Sweet and heavy on the finish, which isn't all that surprising given its 14.5% alcohol level.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Varietally correct on the nose, but weak, with lychee, tropical fruit and Fantastik cleanser aromas. The palate fails to hold form, yielding an oily, heavy feel along with lemony, mealy flavors. Pithy on the finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Hot and rubbery on the nose, and while it doesn't smell bad it doesn't persuade you to go further. The palate has size, but it's not smooth as the acids dominate. And the flavors of berry and cherry are generic and almost impossible to identify as Syrah. Forgettable wine with tartness.",Syrah
Argentina,"Much better and way more complex than your average Torrontés. The bouquet is flower power, lychee and tangerine, and overall this is an exotic, driving wine like no other from Argentina. Expect roundness and similarities to Viognier; it's amplified and impressive.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Immediately this one shines. The nose offers deep bacon, crusty mineral and hefty, perfectly ripe dark-fruit aromas. Balance is key to the wine's success, with beefy, sweet flavors of black plum offset by some fire and proper acidity. Peppery on the finish, with an overall warm, ripe, toasty personality. Ready to drink now.",Red Blend
Argentina,"From vines planted in 1932, this Pinot Noir is simply beautiful. It's bigger and more dense than its younger brother, No. 55, but maybe a tad less elegant and a bit more cellar worthy. The aromas are a blend of fine French oak and natural Pinot aromas of tea, cherry and raspberry. Mineral and coffee appear late on the finish. Unlike any other Pinot from the continent and much more like Burgundy or Oregon than most neophyte New Worlders.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"This is the best and most expensive wine ever released by Dutch-owned Salentein, and it proves that this winery has finally mastered Mendoza. The color is excellent and the nose is full of bold fruit, leather, mint and more. It's a huge Malbec with saturated cassis and black cherry flavors, and the feel and lushness are just right. For a ripe mini monster that's sure to please, drink this now and over the next three years, preferably with grilled beef.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dry and full of savory plum and spice aromas. With zesty and developed raspberry and cherry flavors along with a mostly fresh and balanced mouthfeel, this is a pretty good bargain Merlot.",Merlot
Argentina,"Closed and heavy on the nose, with baked-apple flavors and caramel. Weighs in as full-bodied, with toffee and bitter pith notes on the finish. Aims fairly high and delivers up to an extent: there's size and substance but also some overripeness, corn and pith. Not perfect, but not bad. Imported by Billington Imports.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Intensely colored and miles better than the label's troubled basic Tempranillo, this is an Argentinean rendition of Spain's workhorse grape that showcases berry and plum flavors, plenty of oak and ample chocolate and espresso on the finish. More impressive when taken as a whole; best to drink with barbecue and not get too analytical.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Here's an inexpensive wine that delivers tasty pear and melon flavors. The body is solid, maybe a bit hefty, but there's enough acidity to keep it on track. Easygoing stuff with no surprises. Imported by Hemingway & Hale.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Fairly oaky, as the name might indicate. Flavors of lemon, apple and pineapple are complete, if a bit common, while the feel is round and a touch resiny. Finishes solid, with a modicum of butter. On the heavier side, but acidic enough to maintain its balance. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Although it kicks off on the stewy, baked side of the fence, airing reveals good fruit and ample wood; indeed, there's brandied cherry, vanilla and chocolate to ponder. Long on the finish, albeit a finish that's one-note simple. A little stark in terms of feel.",Merlot
Argentina,"Raspberry, bramble and leather are convincing opening aromas, while the ripe black cherry on the palate is spiced up by some light wood notes. Textured on the tongue, with vanilla and cherry notes to the finish. Not all that Syrah-like, but good as red wine goes.",Syrah
Argentina,"A Cabernet that resides on the dark side. The nose is baked and earthy, with coffee notes. Dark plum and chocolate flavors run wild on the tannic palate, while the lengthy finish is slightly bitter with the taste of espresso. Imported by Epic Wines.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Chunky, flat and stemmy on the nose, with herbal, generic fruit aromas. The palate is o.k. but sort of scratchy, while the flavors veer toward herbal, roasted cherry and berry. Herbal and sort of sweet and heavy on the finish. Pretty much what you'd expect for a $10 Cab.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Roasted, oaky and resiny on the nose, and then the palate delivers a bolt of acidity that makes the wine feel pointy in the mouth. The flavors are herbal and resiny, with foresty black fruit at the core. Creamy and sticky on the finish, and overall it struggles to present a pure, balanced picture.",Syrah
Argentina,"A hot and fiery wine from San Juan province that mixes stewy barnyard aromas with black cherry. The palate has a syrupy, sugary feel and medicinal, creamy, baked berry flavors. Peppery on the finish, but with a medicinal aftertaste.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Chunky and generic smelling, with a nutty, oily palate that isn't purely focused or clean. The palate has some bitterness and excess weight along with fading lychee and melon flavors. Not a terrible wine for $9 but the low price doesn't erase its flaws.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Dull and dilute, but painless. The palate is chunky but with enough acids to stay lively, and the flavors of green apple, lemon and pineapple are decent enough. Tangy and slightly bitter on the finish.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Smoky and rubbery smelling, with brambly, mildly stemmy fruit aromas. The palate is plummy and red in character, with herbal raspberry on the back side. Dry, tangy and herbal on the finish; adequate at best as a whole, even at $9.",Syrah
Argentina,"Bland and chunky, with aromas of talcum powder and apple. The palate feel is a mix of spritz and heft, and the flavors of melon and peach are pithy and lean toward bitter. Dusty and heavy on the finish, an indication that it won't last long and has already seen better days.",Bordeaux-style White Blend
Argentina,"Clos de los Siete, the amalgmated product of Michel Rolland's Uco Valley wine commune, is rich, round and ripe, with deep aromas and trimmings like polished oak and minerality. The wine is proper, medium to full in size, and full of blackberry, plum and cocoa. No hiccups, pure fruit and complexity make this stellar for the price.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Basso's premium blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah and Merlot is an example of good fruit meeting good winemaking. With leather and brick dust accenting black-fruit aromas, the bouquet is positive. And the flavors of plum, blackberry, soy sauce and cola are very nice. A breakout wine for this winery.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Intense, saturated and well balanced, with touches of motor oil, earth and herbs on the nose. The palate is flush and mouthfilling, with proper tannic bite, fine acidity and stylish flavors of blackberry and raspberry.",Malbec
Argentina,"One of the best $15 red blends being made today. Carrascal gives us 45% Malbec, 35% Merlot and 20% Cabernet in rock-solid form. The nose has toast, mineral, balsam wood and good berry fruit, and the palate provides the troika of cherry, raspberry and plum with no interference or oaky gimmicks. Pleasant, warm and long on the finish.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Sweet and rooty on the nose, with hints of cola and earth. This is a solid red wine, with plum, berry and some mild astringency to the palate. Finishes a bit tart but still makes it to the quality level. Likely better with food than by itself.",Merlot
Argentina,"This blend of Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon is very woody, so much so that the nose offers mostly cinnamon and green lumber. The palate, however, is ultracreamy, with vanilla and milk chocolate running the show. Seems a bit sticky and oaky. Could use more uncut fruit. Imported by Epic Wines.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Lightweight in its approach, but still sturdy. The bouquet offers melon, tropical notes and white flowers, while the palate deals mostly cantaloupe and banana. A modestly oaked wine without a ton of stuffing. Good for basic sipping. Imported by Billington Imports.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Standard fare, but nice. The nose offers some burnt sugar in addition to black fruit, while the palate is full of plum, cherry and spice. Chocolate and vanilla are detectable on the medium-length finish, while the feel and balance are proper.",Syrah
Argentina,"Snappy, prickly, red-currant aromas fail to improve with airing. The palate is high in acidity, creating a sheer feel to the cherry and raspberry fruit that drives the flavor profile. Drying and hollow on the finish. Very regular wine, with bramble and tartness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark, crusty aromas mix with sweet coconut on the nose, while the palate seems lactic and oaky despite fairly pointed acidity. Berry and plum flavors are entirely regular, and the finish is sharp due to the aforementioned acidity. A bit leafy tasting as well.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Burnt rubber, roasted generic berry and rooty tobacco aromas define the nose, which sets up a tangy, sharp, angular palate that shows little more than tart, quick cherry and raspberry flavors. Short and light on the finish.",Merlot
Argentina,"Flat on the nose, with neutral, slightly floral aromas. The palate is zesty and tart, with midland flavors of lemon, sour apple and lime. Chalky but o.k. on the finish. A one-dimensional white with hardly any lasting potential.",Pinot Gris
Argentina,"Incredibly candied and sweet smelling, much like cotton candy or pink marshmallows. The palate has a cloying, sticky mouthfeel and flavors of raisin, milk chocolate and herbal, tart berry fruits. Creamy and carob-like on the finish. Tastes and smells affected.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Jammy and murky smelling, and lacking clarity and zap on the nose. Surprisingly, the palate is jacked up with acidity, and thus it's sharp in the mouth and strained. Flavors of red fruits are made creamy by forced oak, yielding a milk chocolate note to the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Stemmy and earthy, as it smells like a mud puddle with herbal fruit mixed in. Tastes more like bitter, rubbery cherry than anything, and it's hard and dry on the finish, with a lasting flavor of baked beans. Not the worst thing going but not very good either.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Full, chewy, doughy, spicy and intensely fruity. This single-vineyard Malbec offers a little bit of everything, and all in balanced, measured doses. The cherry and blackberry fruit is bold but pure, while chocolate comes in to darken things up. A textbook steak and potatoes wine with a bit of complexity, but mostly it's about easygoing fun.",Malbec
Argentina,"Since coming onto the scene with the 2002 vintage, this Chilean-run venture (Montes S.A.) has hit the right notes time after time. The 2005 Ultra is exactly as we've come to expect: It's saturated, dark, meaty and ripe, with huge blackberry flavors and lavish creamy oak. Very modern, but done in the right way.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sweet from the start, with maple and pear on the bouquet. More soft than sturdy, with a candied palate that offers round, almost sugary citrus flavors. Easy for a glass or two, but without the voltage to go further.",Sparkling Blend
Argentina,"Gold in color and on the dry, waxy side. Shows mineral and dried fruits on the nose, with heavy pear and apple bulking up the palate. Finishes short, with some pithy bitterness. But good overall, with a roundness that's appealing. Imported by South Valley Wines.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A little bit of bramble and green  on the nose, but by and large this wine is solid. The palate offers sweetness and brown sugar along with zesty fruit, while the tannic structure and persistence are unavoidable. Imported by Victoire Imports.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Light, tropical but ultimately dilute, with chalky, drying, tart flavors that run toward lemon and underripe pineapple. Lemony on the finish and monotone.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Not bad on the nose, where you get some tropicality, buttercup and flower blossom. But once you get onto the palate things go south. The acidity is high, creating tangy, lemony flavors, and all totaled there's not much here besides generic citrus and water.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Aromas of applesauce, lemon cake and lychee are probably the best part of the wine. In the mouth, it's chunky and wan, with candied, sweet apple and melon flavors. Finishes heavy, and overall it seems to be on an early fade.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Maybe this wine is already past its prime, but given that we aren't that familiar gauging barrel-aged blends of Sauvignon Vert, Pinot Gris, Chard and Torrontés, all we can say is that it comes across odd, resiny and heavy. Barrel notes and mustard flavors aren't all that great, and overall it's chunky, soft and tastes strange.",White Blend
Argentina,"Dusty, flat and cidery on the nose, and then heavy and clunky in the mouth, with flat, bland mildly bitter citrus and apple flavors. Finishes broad and pithy, and maybe a bit oxidized as well.",Pinot Gris
Argentina,"Much of what's wrong with Argentinean Chard is on full display here. The nose is stalky, hot and oily, with little freshness of fruit. And the mouth is hot and grating, with stemmy, bitter apple and citrus flavors. Tolerable on a good day, but is this really what the consumer wants?",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Vanilla and a dusty hollowness define the nose, and then comes an extremely sweet and sugary palate that almost makes your teeth and jaws hurt. Very sweet and unctuous, and thus it's to be avoided if dry whites are all you drink.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Congratulations go to Schroeder for having the guts to blend Pinot Noir and Malbec, and to get a great wine out of it. The mix is pure Patagonia, and after some fiery, dark aromas the palate takes over with a mix of bright fruit and chocolate. Round, large and full to the last drop, this is well worth a go should you come across it. 1,000 cases made.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Cruz Alta is a new, higher-end label from Escorihuela, the long-time maker of value-priced Don Gascón. This is indeed a reserve-level wine (with 15% Cabernet and Syrah), and it's ripe, forward, powerful and mildly tannic. And there's lots of oak to offset the dark berry flavors. Finishes toasty and firm, with mocha.",Malbec
Argentina,"The nose offers hints of rubber and smoked meat, but the fruit is difficult to peg. The mouth is ripe enough, with notes of blackberry and chocolate. Mouthcoating, but with soft tannins.",Merlot
Argentina,"The nose bears a strong resemblance to canned fruit, particularly peaches. The palate offers some zesty nectarine and even more fruit cocktail. Moderately snappy, with some solid core acidity. The blend is 50% Chardonnay and 50% Viognier. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Chardonnay-Viognier
Argentina,"Chunky and on the verge of overripe, with soft peach and melon aromas. Additional peach and melon flavors define the overweight palate, while the finish is heavy but flavorful. Tasty stuff with merits, but its lifespan is going to be short. Imported by 57 Main Street Wine Co.",Viognier
Argentina,"Flowery and lively, with apple and mild citrus flavors. More than decent on the tongue, with good balance. More steady and solid than spectacular, with varietal correctness and ample weight.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A bit of pumpkin and squash on the early nose, with apple coming later. Comes across with orange and honey on the palate, and there's soft melon on the finish. Sort of sweet but it works.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Generic at best, with lemon and pool water aromas that aren't about to stir many smiles. The palate is flat almost to the point of mushy, with dull lychee and green apple flavors.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Green, grassy and not very appealing. There's a can't-miss murky, green, herbal character here that yields almost weedy fruit flavors and carob. Sweet, candied, green and just not that good for a Paul Hobbs-made wine.",Merlot
Argentina,"Off the grid in terms of aromas, which hint at blueberry and candy but don't seem right or familiar. The palate is grainy and jammy, with raisiny flavors as well as souring acidity. Herbal and then bland on the short finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Wines like this are why Argentina would be best served sticking to reds. This has no bouquet to speak of, and the palate is dilute, tangy, citrusy and sharp. Acceptable but that's it.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Yellow and chunky, and definitely on the way toward the grave. Mustardy aromas are severely short on freshness, and the palate is just as flat, dull and mealy as the nose. A weird, low-acid blend of Chardonnay, Viognier and Chenin Blanc.",White Blend
Argentina,"Smells like a can of green beans, or maybe it's canned peas. Either way, the nose is a siren call of what's to come: celery, acid, lime, asparagus and canned peas. No thank you.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"If the color doesn't tell the full story, the nose will: it's impeccably perfumed, round and sweet, with amazing fruit aromas and a toasty background. The feel is as lush and rich as they come, and there's outstanding purity to the lusty black fruit flavors. A masher with elegance. Maybe the best Malbec Argentina has ever produced. Drink from 2011–15.",Malbec
Argentina,"All sorts of smoky berry, cola and controlled toast aromas get this wine going in the right direction. It tastes very good, with pure, less than bashful plum and cola flavors leading straight to a fruity, lasting finish. This may not have much sauvage, old world Syrah character; but for Argentina it's made right and registers from head to toe.",Syrah
Argentina,"A five-grape mash-up with savory aromas of roasted oak, smoke, bacon and clove aromas. Despite slightly crisp acidity, the wine is lusty and giving, with juicy cherry, cassis and other bright-flavored fruit. Good length and some chocolate on the finish send it away in fine form. 550 cases made.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Deep purple in color and fierce on the nose; there's no shortage of piercing French oak aromas to send this one on its way. But once it settles, the oak supports classy blackberry, boysenberry and peppery flavors along with a structured, dense mouthfeel.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is a lively, slightly jagged wine with full ripeness and lots of berry, spice and zip. The palate hits hard with cherry, raspberry and pepper flavors, and there's a bit of rasp and burn to the finish. Should get a little softer with more bottle age.",Merlot-Malbec
Argentina,"Warm and earthy, with a touch of sulfur that subsides with air. The palate is juicy but also sort of rich, and the flavors of mixed red fruits feature a couple of layers of potency that are followed by a compact, medium-length finish.",Malbec-Merlot
Argentina,"Cavas Weinert is an old-school Mendoza winery and it holds its wines longer than most, which is why this 2002 is just now a new release. Thank Weinert for the bottle age and give this wine plenty of air. What you'll get is earth, leather, complexity, depth and ample berry fruit and chocolate. Decant for best results.",Malbec
Argentina,"Chakana makes some good wines, and the pack is led by this prestige-level blend of Cab Sauvignon, Malbec and Bonarda. It's plenty racy and forward, with plum and berry flavors that ring the bell. Toward the end some oak-based vanilla enters the game to applause. A yummy, well-made wine.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Simple and floral; not concentrated. This lightweight is tasty enough and overall it's balanced. The palate deals citrus, melon and crispness, and the feel is lively and juicy. Tastes more like Spanish Albariño than Chardonnay.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Stately, stunning Malbec with alluring aromas of balsam wood, flower petals, cocoa and cola along with major league berry action. The palate is saturated, pure, tannic and loaded with blasting berry fruit, licorice and more. Let it age for at least another year or two (maybe more). Then let it rip with a porterhouse steak.",Malbec
Argentina,"Probably the best value in high-end Malbec from Argentina is Trapiche's single-vineyard series, which in 2006 was led by this bottling from an Uco Valley vineyard. It's lush, perfectly ripe and full of cola, black fruit and intensity. There's nary a chink in its fiber, and the rush of fruit that hits the palate followed by layers of subtleties is impressive. Great with grilled meat; drink now through 2015.",Malbec
Argentina,"From a 50+-year-old vineyard in La Consulta in the Uco Valley comes this bold, seriously built Malbec. Black cherry and coconut aromas settle in nicely, followed by forward raspberry, mocha and coffee notes. Great acidity, tannic foundation, structure and fillings; it's like a happy house. Drink from 2011 through 2015.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big and burly, with a semi- syrupy nose that brings berry jam, molasses, shoe polish and crusty, baked berry aromas. But don't dismiss this Cab as overripe and over the top; it is complete and balanced, with good acidity pushing black fruit, chocolate, clove and herb flavors to their maximum expression. And it dials it in on the finish, where cola and coffee notes are just right. Drink now through 2010.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Ripe to the tipping point of being a little bit baked, but the nose of spice and mint mixed with violet, black cherry and plum is attractive. The palate on this blend is concentrated but well balanced, and the jammy flavors of plum and berry are not too heavy.",Red Blend
Argentina,"An elevated, classy wine with earth, tobacco, leather and currant aromas. It's a little saucy and saturated, but with air it unveils layering and flavors of coconut (oak-based), leather, cassis and plum. Rich on the finish, with chocolate and rubber notes. Drink now or hold through 2011.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Blueberry jam and some violet-like aromas get it off the mark, with plum and black cherry flavors playing second fiddle. Mildly tart and zesty in terms of feel, with a light finish. Mainstream all the way.",Shiraz
Argentina,"Moderately fruity on the nose, with a hint of leafiness and pickle. Raspberry and strawberry flavors are generally sweet, while the feel is a bit on the sharp side. Simple and straightforward, but with hardly any recognizable Shiraz character.",Shiraz
Argentina,"So woody at first you'd think you had entered a sawmill, but with time it settles down. Red berries, milk chocolate and wood spice work the palate, followed by lean fruit leftovers and vanilla.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Pickled at first, while oak comes on strong as it airs out. The palate shows a lot of butter and toast, with only mild fruit hanging out in the background. Dry and short in the long run.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Ordinary plum and berry aromas to start, followed by a more jammy palate that tastes of berry compote. A touch of chocolate and pepper carry the finish. All totaled this is decent wine with middle-of-the-road characteristics.",Shiraz
Argentina,"Mint and rubber band scents open the bouquet, and then black fruit and marmalade aromas take over. This Bonarda is riper, softer and more cuddly than most, with ultraripe black-fruit flavors and soft tannins that make it borderline sappy. Plump, easygoing and loaded with fruit. Drink now to get the soft, giving side of this grape.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Sweet blackberry fruit and minerally darkness give this Malbec a smooth, inviting bouquet. And in the mouth, it's just as nice: light butter, juicy raspberry and plum flavors, and then dark spice on the finish. Among the best values in Argentina.",Malbec
Argentina,"Speechless at first as the nose offers very little. The mouth offers basic dark fruit with some tannins. Grabby at first, but better as it opens up. Rubbery but fairly ripe.",Malbec
Argentina,"Starts with apple covered in oak-based caramel and vanilla, but loses its focus as it evolves. The palate is a mishmash of melon, citrus and papaya, while the overall take is that its less than stellar but not offensive. In this case, the organic qualifier isn't a boost.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Ripe, jammy and forward, with very little besides heavy berry fruit to offer. The palate is overtly oaky, with butter and wood notes. Grapy and a raw in the middle, with some displaced tannins.",Merlot
Argentina,"A big blast of oak rises up from the glass, a barrier to what fruit might lie below. Once you get to the palate, there's tight but somewhat tart raspberry and a touch of leather. Not nearly as ripe and rich as the oak on the nose calls for; thus the end result is almost sour, which isn't an attribute when it comes to Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Roasted and deep at first, which is encouraging. But it doesn't really stand the test, showing tart plum and berry flavors, out-of-place tannin and shortness on the palate. Finishes too thin and hard.",Merlot
Argentina,"Expensive Malbec, but there's no denying its quality and class. The bouquet is super smooth and silky, but also powerful. And that pretty much describes the palate: beautiful berry fruit rides a wave of richness that comes with accents of vanilla and pepper. Sexy, alluring wine with character.",Malbec
Argentina,"Another well-polished Malbec from Trapiche's single-vineyard series. This one, from Tupungato in the Uco Valley, is the most “red” of the '06s. The fruit is juicy and bursts with acidity and power. Cherry, red plum and cassis are the lead flavors, and it finishes on a bed of chocolate and peppery spice. Good now but will benefit from another year or two in bottle.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lively black cherry and plum aromas indicate that this slightly older wine is still vibrant and healthy. The palate is solid, tannic and medium in weight, with sweet but balanced dark-fruit flavors. This is a tasty, well-made, familiar style of Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Saturated Malbec, with an opaque color and dense, sweet aromas that are slightly floral and pastry-like. Big and rich in the mouth, with bold cassis, blackberry and plum flavors floating on a soft, almost jammy structure. Finishes full and oily in texture. Rich and ready to drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"Like its little brother Calvulcura, this wine is Cabernet Sauvignon mixed with Merlot. It's a big boy with stewed berries, prune and licorice on the bouquet. Below that heavy nose is a palate that's sweet and ripe, and arguably too much so. If chocolate, richness and heft are your thing, this is a winner; purists, however, may wish for more tannin, structure and nuance.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
Argentina,"Movie popcorn, baked fruits and plenty of toast and vanilla work the entry, while forward flavors of apple and pear are kicked up a notch by full acidity. And what that all means is that fruit pierces the fairly heavy oak on this wine, leaving you with a lot of the positives of New World Chardonnay. Nice in this price range.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Round, pretty and ripe; a dead knock-off for modern-style Rioja. There are sun-baked aromas but not the cooked type, with a palate that pushes dark berry flavors and chocolate. A rich, almost medicinal wine, the type that can often cost $50. And here it's $9. Weighs in at 14.6%, so it should have its fans.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"A blasting bouquet of oak and affiliated cinnamon and spice are wave one, while next up there's dark fruit and a wealth of vanilla. This is one saturated Malbec, with menthol and tannins in spades. Only medium follow-through on the finish tempers the final grade. Imported by Southern Wine Group.",Malbec
Argentina,"If you want ripe-fruit aromas and flavors along with spice, pepper and coffee accents, this well-oaked but reasonably restrained Malbec is your ticket. The flavors run closer to raspberry and strawberry than many big Malbecs, and the texture and balance are just right. This wine delivers the maximum given its price and pedigree.",Malbec
Argentina,"Heavy and flat, with dull apple aromas. The palate delivers simple yellow fruit, while the finish is soft and devoid of spunk. There isn't a whole lot more to say about this wine; it's a cipher.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Good color but the nose and palate don't offer that Cabernet lushness that most of us seek. The red-fruit nose is kind of lean, probably a reflection of Patagonia's cool climate. And the palate is peppery and starchy, with hard tannins.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Light and candied, with strawberry drink mix as the main aroma. In the mouth, it's rather sticky and sweet, with basic characteristics. Adequate in terms of feel and balance.",Merlot
Argentina,"Not a whole lot to say about the soft, flat nose. It's o.k., but that's really about it. The palate, meanwhile, turns sweet, nearly to the point of candied. And the finish is downright sugary. Decent weight and feel help it along.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Jumbled, with sweet, soft fruit that is sugary and quite strange. Not exactly off the mark but a hard wine to like. It's sweet and candied and unfocused.",Malbec
Argentina,"Awkward, with early aromatics akin to sauerkraut. Airing doesn't totally shake that funky character, and the fruit seems on the cooked side. Acceptable mouthfeel. Imported by Winesellers Ltd.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A lot of raisin and heavy cola aromas weigh down the bouquet in front of reduced, almost condensed baked-fruit flavors. A stewy wine with a saving streak of acidity in the middle tier.",Merlot
Argentina,"Round, red, ripe and rubbery. It weighs in at 14% but seems like a mystery wine when tasted blind. Yields little Pinot character but as generic red wine it's acceptable. Tastes mostly of anonymous berry and chocolate.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Nondescript in terms of fruit flavors, with a strong hint of green pepper. Decent feel and length, with spice. But just too much green character to score better.",Merlot
Argentina,"There's no drop-off in this wine from the excellent 2005. Expect blackberry, cassis and dry balsam wood/cedar aromas. The palate is lush and chewy, but also vital and lively. Toasty, dark berry flavors get a softening of vanilla on the finish. A winner to drink now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"Coconut and inky black fruit melt into an ultrarich and layered bouquet, and that's the perfect entree to the wine's sweet, broad, chocolaty black fruit flavors that come with a cool mint accent. Boiled down this is nothing more than a concentrated, bold Malbec that's sweet, tasty and uncomplicated. Drink now through 2011.",Malbec
Argentina,"Among full-bodied, old-vines Malbec, this is an unbridled winner. The nose is rooty and sweet, but also inky and dark. And the palate is totally pure, with snappy tannins, fine acidity and loads of black fruit flavor mixed with tobacco and coconut. Racy, juicy and delicious as it enters its prime. Drink now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"Warm black-fruit aromas along with earth and controlled oak give this Malbec a nice bouquet, and the palate features full berry flavors and a dark-spice accent. The finish is smooth, mellow and slightly chocolaty. Satisfying, legitimate Malbec in every way.",Malbec
Argentina,"One of the best Argentine value Chardonnays on the market. The nose is stylish, with butterscotch, honeyed apple and vanilla notes. Smooth on the palate, with more than adequate apple and peach flavors, and then pure and fairly long on the finish. For clarity and real Chardonnay character, there aren't many better options than this, especially for $12.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Full, dark and minty, with aromatic notes of coconut and ink. One look, sniff and sip tells you this is a dark, ripe wine with extract. It's fairly lush but still tannic and balanced, with black coffee and other dark flavors on the somewhat narrow palate and finish. Imported by Excelsior Wine & Spirits.",Malbec
Argentina,"At 15% alcohol and with a nose full of prune, blazing oak and simmering blackberry jam, this is not for the weak. In fact, it may not be for the strong, because while we like the wine's sun-baked, ultraripe personality, we also acknowledge that it's teetering on the brink and probably won't age for very long.",Malbec
Argentina,"Finca Las Moras is getting fancy with this proprietary blend of Malbec and Bonarda, and with good results. The wine offers earthy, heavily wooded aromas in front of generous black cherry and chocolate flavors. It's a saturated, superripe wine that may miss a beat or two along the tour but has its positives.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Overtly floral and jumpy, with potent aromas of perfume. Heavy in the mouth, with odd, bland flavors of applesauce and spice. Soft and sticky.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Sweet as can be, with strong aromas of talcum powder and air freshener. Rather lean in the mouth, with a watery, processed flavor profile. Not awful but not much to write home about.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Saucy and herbal, with leather and citrus peel on the nose. Heavy and undistinguished on the palate, with atypical plum and blackberry flavors. Hard to identify as Pinot Noir.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Granular and reduced on the nose, with bulky fruit flavors and an awkward mouthfeel. Finishes rather heavy and a bit burnt.",Merlot
Argentina,"Transparent in color, with bubblegum and candied fruit on the nose. Sweet and rubbery on the palate, with a lean, burnt personality. Not horrible but surely nothing to rave about.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Green and austere, with burnt grass on the nose and palate. Cranberry fruit is sharp; not a prime-timer. Barely acceptable.",Malbec
Argentina,"Deep and juicy Malbec with aromas of violets, blackberry, coconut shavings and mineral. There's also a cedary element to the nose and palate. Otherwise, look for full-force wild berry and cassis flavors and a smooth, clean finish. Nothing awkward or forced; Doña Paula's best Malbec ever. Drink now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"Interesting floral, herb, cherry and chocolate-mint aromas are a good preview of the racy black cherry and berry flavors that rule the palate. The acidity is a bit pointed, giving the wine an edgy feel. But with elevated flavors as well as cola and chocolate on the finish it comes across nice and ready to drink.",Malbec
Argentina,"Alamos takes Merlot to the next level with this ripe, jammy, crusty offering. The black fruit on the nose is dense and pure, the mouthfeel is round and generous, and the flavors of ripe plum and berry ring true. Layered, long and easygoing on the finish. Very nice for Argentinean Merlot.",Merlot
Argentina,"This is one of the best—if not the best—yet from this producer. Alluring plum, berry and cola aromas meet every requirement of a very good Malbec, while the palate is fresh, sturdy and shows a cool mix of red fruit, chocolate and spice. Even the finish is abnormally long and smooth for an under-$10 wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pure and stout, with prime black-fruit aromas supported by toasty oak and mineral-like char. Blackberry is the lead flavor on the thick, dense palate, while the finish is solid if a little sedentary. Nicely focused and forward; probably what most people are looking for from Argentinean Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smooth and consistent Malbec from Cafayate is what Michel Torino is all about. Don David is a higher-aiming effort, and while it shows a touch of northern Argentina's herbal, sun-affected characteristics, it's also a well-balanced, formulaic Malbec that hits all the markers: good color, nice body, friendly tannins and plenty of oak.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pronounced oak is the opening blast, and amid the shy red berry and tomato leaf aromas there are hints of leather, mint and coconut. All these scents indicate that heavy wood was thrown at the wine, so while the power and goals of the wine are admirable, it's weighed down presently by a touch too much resin. Maybe that'll drift with time but that's not for sure.",Malbec
Argentina,"A good finisher, with early minty, resiny aromas giving way to broader, more typical ripe aromas and flavors. The mouthfeel is lively courtesy of vivid core acidity, while the berry and cherry flavors come across ripe and grabby. The more air you give it the better it'll perform. Imported by Slocum & Sons.",Malbec
Argentina,"Open and rewarding, with strawberry and raspberry aromas followed by ripe, clean cherry and raspberry flavors. Don't expect a ton of depth or richness, but do expect a food-friendly wine that's convincing and well made.",Merlot
Argentina,"Soft, easy and totally ripe, this easygoing blend of Cabernet and Merlot should win over most consumers because it's a friendly sort that's endowed with cola, plum and abundant richness. Opponents may find it soft and mealy, but no matter where you stand it should be drunk as soon as possible. Imported by SWG Imports.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
Argentina,"Here and there you'll find a very well-made Argentine Viognier because the country's warmth and the grape can go together. A case in point is this plump, lush specimen that sports developed lemon and orange flavors and a long, acid-propelled finish.",Viognier
Argentina,"Concha Y Toro's Argentine property seems to be getting it right with Malbec. This affordable number is dark and dense, with plum and prune on the nose and concentrated berry flavors on the palate. For a meaty, structured, fully oaked Malbec, Trivento is the call. Imported by Excelsior Wine & Spirits.",Malbec
Argentina,"If you'd like a little character, bramble and spice to your Cab, then this is where you should go. Yes, it starts out with leather, pickle barrel and a lot of bramble bush, but every time you go back to it there's more fruit, polish, complexity and style. It's interesting, ripe and a step up from your basic street-level Cabernet.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A very rich and soft wine made from hand-squeezed Malbec grapes. There's a ton of oak on it, which comes out as coconut and cream on the nose. The palate is also creamy, with mocha, sweet blackberry and fudge flavors. Cola, coconut, coffee and other hedonistic, dark, masculine accents make this a fun and interesting wine to drink now. Best on its own or with meat.",Malbec
Argentina,"Here's a full-of-dynamite, small-batch Malbec that smells of bold berry fruit mixed with earth, smoked meats and mocha. The flavor set is pure, driving blackberry with mild herbal accents, and the finish is long, flavorful and lightly herbal. Expensive and a little fiery, but still excellent. Drink now through 2013. Only 250 cases made.",Malbec
Argentina,"Good from the beginning, with deep berry aromas touched up by mocha, vanilla and road tar. The palate of cassis, black fruit and light herbs is juicy and lively, and while the finish is standard in terms of feel and length, it offers oak-driven coconut and spice flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"This unusual marriage of Pinot Noir and Malbec has a familiar set of aromas and flavors. There's raspberry, tobacco and lemon peel on the nose, while the palate tastes of blackberry and tobacco, with some sweetness. Not pushy, a little strange, and overall very good.",Red Blend
Argentina,"This is the kosher version of Gran Malbec made by Flechas, and it's concentrated and rich, with an oily sort of feel along with fairly soft tannins. Aromas of roasted fruits hint at the olive, baked plum and tempered herb flavors that come later, and the finish is thick and chewy. A broad, succulent but shy Malbec. Drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"The nose is full of mellow raspberry and cherry, while the palate is fleshy and round, with blackberry and a touch of raisin. Plump, not edgy, and ready to drink, with coffee and mocha notes on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Hard black fruit and notes of tire rubber and tar indicate that this is a dark, masculine wine. And while it does offer power, it's actually quite racy and balanced in the mouth. Flavorwise, expect black raspberry and some bitter cocoa. Overall, there's nothing unripe about it.",Malbec
Argentina,"Interesting Argentine Cabernet, with rooty, baked aromas that settle in and impress if given time. The palate is balanced by subtle red-fruit and earthy flavors, while the feel is stocky and grabby courtesy of strong tannins. A good wine with a lot of positives.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"After you chop your way through the black forest of char, roasted berry and coffee aromas, you'll encounter a pretty large mass of flavors that include blackberry, cola, root beer and cinnamon. It's a fairly packed and saturated wine at 14.9%, and the finish of mocha and chocolate accentuates the wine's oak elevage. Best for those who like ripeness and size. The blend is 60% Merlot and 40% Cab Sauvignon.",Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Full, serious and ripe, with leather, animal and an underside of savory oak and bacon. Typical of the house style, the wine is lush and jammy, with syrupy black-fruit flavors setting up a composed, rich finish. Best for fans of hefty, New World reds.",Malbec
Argentina,"Mildly raisiny on the bouquet. The palate is round and full-bodied, with blackberry and roasted plum flavors backed by smooth tannins and a chocolaty, savory finish. Heavier and warmer than some red blends, but not clumsy or overdone.",Malbec-Merlot
Argentina,"Ripe and big, with campfire aromas and black fruit. There's a bulky molasses and brown sugar element to this wine along with blackberry and creamy mocha. Ripe and rich for a value-priced Malbec, but that said, it teeters on the verge of being syrupy. Best if you like creamy New World reds.",Malbec
Argentina,"Among Argentine high fliers this blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Tannat lacks a little. The nose is mildly stemmy and herbal, while the flavors of wild berry and cranberry are a touch reedy. Tannat and Petit Verdot are not commonplace grapes, and maybe that's why the wine seems sort of herbal and edgy despite having its good qualities.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Here is how you get Torrontés right. The nose sheds dusty lemon and apple blossom aromas, which are followed by lemon-lime and citrus flavors. The palate has solid density and stuffing, and the finish evolves toward orange and pineapple.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Touches of tree bark, nutmeg and aged cheese give the nose diversity compared to the standard blackberry and vanilla, and in the mouth the wine is full of cola, root beer and other savory flavors in addition to berry fruit. It's a bit grabby and tannic, but overall it is quite good.",Malbec
Argentina,"A good effort by Cavas Weinert. The wine is starting to mature, and along the road you get ripe berry aromas that broaden and improve with time. The plum, blackberry and red apple flavors are right, as is the tannin-to-acid balance. The only complaint is a mild chemical-paint thinner note at the base of the bouquet.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sweet plum, raisin and chocolate work the welcoming nose, and on the palate the wine is generous but easy to understand; the flavors are flush and ripe but none too complicated. Simply stated, this wine is healthy and well made.",Malbec
Argentina,"The opening of floral and plum aromas is nice, and that's followed by some earth and heft. The palate is fleshy and tannic, with deep raspberry and plum flavors. The depth on this wine is pretty good, yet it finishes sort of short.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"The wine has a dark, crusty top to the nose, with solid berry aromas under that. The palate is bright, zesty and features familiar plum and black cherry flavors. And the finish is straightforward but smooth. Stylish, with a little snap, crackle and pop.",Malbec
Argentina,"A big, full-bodied Malbec with charm. The nose is toasty, with black fruit, chocolate and other stocky, earthy aromas. Saturated in the mouth, with concentrated black fruit flavors. Shows touches of mint and spice on the finish along with coffee, licorice and chocolate. Drink now through 2012.",Malbec
Argentina,"Inky, dark, charred and serious, and it only gets better as it opens with air. The palate has a smooth, deep, comfortable feel and the flavors are sweet, fruity, creamy and proper for Malbec. Chocolaty and rich on the finish. A very nice wine made for near-term drinking.",Malbec
Argentina,"Every llama has its day, and for Funky Llama this is one to take to the bank. The olive, leather and dry oaky aromas set the stage for solid cassis, raspberry and herb flavors. The body, feel and finish seem right, so for the money it's a blue chip special.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This is Bousquet's better 2006 Malbec because it doesn't have the heavy-handed oak of the Reserva. Here you get a ton of ripe, clean fruit with secondary leather and earth aromas. The palate is lively as it hits with firm blackberry and plum flavors. Not complex but good in its simplicity. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Malbec
Argentina,"From a global wine bottler named Xavier Flouret, this Torrontés is a full-fruited, oily specimen. The nose boasts lychee, perfume and acacia, while the palate pumps out melon and apple flavors. Big it is; precise it's not. But it's rewarding. “Flaca” may mean skinny in Spanish, but this wine is far from that.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Blackberry and plum aromas have just enough leather and horsehide accents to give this wine character. The mouth is centered squarely on purple fruits like plum and wild blackberry, and the feel and finish are comfortable and fresh. Lively and with all the basics in the right places.",Merlot
Argentina,"Tight on the nose, with hints of resin, lemon peel and black fruit that smell inviting when all added up. The palate is juicy, arguably a bit acidic, and runs fresh with red cherry and plum flavors. Spunky and properly tannic.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"If a Chardonnay could suffer from something called “barrel breath,” this one would. It's like a bowl full of lacquer and heady melon, and the palate is sweet, sweet, sweet. There's vanilla, marshmallow and resin along with more typical melon and citrus. A case of more being less; just too much oak and candy to rate higher.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Scratchy raspberry aromas lend some harshness to the bouquet, but that's replaced soon after by earthy berry fruit notes. The palate is plump and full, with chunky, thick flavors of black fruit that are nice but quiet. Fruity, jammy and easygoing throughout. Drink now into 2012.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is a blend of Cab Sauvignon, Malbec and Merlot that's agile, fresh and offers good mouthfeel. The nose deals crushed brick, leather, spice and light red fruit, while the flavors run toward red cherry and red currants. Uncomplicated; drink now. Imported by Quintessential Wines, LLC.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A full and pulsing wine, with leather and other animal notes to make things more interesting. The mouth is like a black-fruit explosion: muscular berry and tannins fly all over the place, ending in a lively, almost fiery finish. A bit grabby and overexcited, but good with grilled meats.",Malbec
Argentina,"From San Rafael in southern Mendoza, this Cab Sauvignon picks up a little more steam and complexity every time you go back to it. The nose is your basic cassis and raspberry, while the medium-weight palate features ripe fruit finishing in a sweet cascade of milk chocolate and burnt brown sugar. Satisfying, especially if you like a hint of sweetness to your Cab.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Jammy red-fruit aromas mixed with buttery oak make for a simple, sappy nose. There's more butter on the palate in addition to solid blackberry flavors. It finishes round but short, with yet another wave of barrel. A very good wine but not one that wows.",Malbec
Argentina,"A light but obvious blast of coconut opens things, followed by aromas of black fruit, vanilla and toast. The palate is fresh and zesty, with snappy acidity adding tang and zest to the flavors of plum, raspberry and cassis. Overall it's composed but sort of short, while the finish is medium long and ends with a dash of mocha. Seems a little on the lean side while still showing the up side of Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Crusty on the nose, with aromas of leather, saucy fruit and alcohol. The wine is full and sweet, with ripe, sturdy flavors of blackberry, plum and raisin followed by fudge and herbs. It blends richness with agility.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark and full-bodied, with a big bouquet of coconut, char and blackberry. The palate is thick and chunky, and that seems right given the wine's sweet black-fruit and chocolate flavors. Add in some oak, baking spice and mocha and you've got a solid, tasty, generous wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dry berry fruit and spice make for a solid but very common and regular type of nose. The palate is based on a lively bead of acids that lift and amplify the flavors of plum and cherry. A little hot but solid on the finish, thus it leaves a tangy final impression.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Chunky and full, with raisin, oak and mocha aromas. The palate comes across round and healthy, with mint and herb notes accenting plum and blackberry flavors. To justify its “gran reserva” moniker the oak is front and center, but the fruit is solid.",Malbec
Argentina,"Norton's Lo Tengo (I Got It) line has a winner in this vivacious Malbec. It's light and a little candied on the nose, but also floral and attractive. The palate is medium-bodied and fresh, with raspberry, cherry and cassis flavors. Clean, mildly tannic, good acidity: what more do want from an inexpensive, trendy red?",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark fruit and plenty of oak on the nose, with a creamy vanilla-based palate that's sporting plenty of new wood to match the bouquet. The barrel is front and center here, but there's also solid Cab texture and power. Imported by Excelsior Wine & Spirits.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Smoke, rubber and a touch of herbs and leaves make this more traditional in style, meaning it offers Old World Bordeaux notes of earth, mineral and subdued fruit as opposed to ripe, jammy berry notes. It's not a big, aggressive wine but it does have tannic strength and intensity. Malbec, Merlot and Cab Sauvignon make up the blend.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"In a shrinking domain (wines for under $10), this junior-league Malbec shows sweet, jammy aromas and legitimate berry flavors. And that alone puts it ahead of the game. The palate is basically a mish-mash of berry flavors and raw tannins, but with food, preferably hamburgers or ribs, it will do the trick.",Malbec
Argentina,"A rambunctious young buck of a wine, with untamed aromas and plenty of aggressiveness from front to back. It clamps with firm tannins while delivering dark plum and other black-fruit flavors. Gets better with airing and may improve in the bottle. Now, it needs food to tame the beast.",Malbec
Argentina,"Familia Schroeder is making good, restrained wines in Neuquén. This Merlot won't rock your world but it will deliver firm, fresh raspberry flavors, food-friendly acidity and solid tannins. And it's even got some chewy sweetness.",Merlot
Argentina,"Powerful in Zinny character, this blend of Dry Creek and Russian River grapes bursts with brawny flavors of wild berries, chocolate-covered mint, tobacco and pepper, wrapped into sturdy tannins. Shows real class and character.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Opens with roasted fruit notes and an earthy character that qualifies as intriguing. The palate is fresh, wide and healthy, with cassis, blackberry and a hint of rhubarb that adds some edge. Overall this is a solid Cabernet; it finishes long and with coffee and mocha. Drink now into 2010.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"In this price class, consistency is a virtue, and year after year Santa Julia's Malbec delivers the basics and a little bit more. This wine has some up-front oak to give warmth, lemon and a mocha or root beer quality to the bouquet. The palate revolves around plum and wild berry flavors, and there's no shortage of oak and mint on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"For something a little lighter, more herbal and different than the usual Mendoza heavyweight, this multigrape blend offers aromatic notes of pancetta, herb, fennel and dried cherry along with flavors of blueberry and elderflower. It's light-to-medium in size, with a Rhône-style personality. Drink now.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Chunky, stout and solid on the nose, with round, pure flavors of black cherry and raspberry. The mouthfeel is comfortable and complete, especially for an $11 wine from Argentina. Finishes dry, smooth and slightly spicy; very pleasing in a no-nonsense way.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dry and lightly balsamic on the nose, with solid fruit aromas that show a marginal level of stem. The palate is stacked with black cherry and blueberry along with full tannins. The finish, however, is surprisingly silky, with chocolate and coconut flavors. A deep, nice, layered wine that has a lot going for it.",Malbec
Argentina,"A three-grape blend of Cab Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Merlot. The nose is rich and mossy, with vanilla and baked fruit aromas. It's big and tannic on the palate, and thus the sweet, semi-baked flavors of black fruit are appropriate. Sticky and tasting of brown sugar on the finish. Rich but good, especially with grilled beef.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Dense, rich and encouraging on the nose, with full blackberry flavors and a flush mouthfeel. For Argentine Cab this gets it right much more than wrong. The flavors are fairly well developed and the finish has length.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Not a bad steak or burger wine given that it offers some kicking acidity to go with sassy cherry and oak-based flavors. This is more of a forward, racy Cabernet. It doesn't lay heavily on the palate; in fact, it's a touch jumpy and staunch despite its oak cask moniker.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Having always liked this wine, which is 86% Cab and the rest Malbec and Merlot, the 2002 seems a touch bland and underwhelming. The color is dense and the nose muscular and herbal, but it peters out quickly and shows no signs that it will get better with age. Imported by Quintessential Wines, LLC.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A little loose on the bouquet, with a whiff of sulfur and leather to go with wild berry aromas. In the mouth, it's got an Old World coarseness that turns the flavor profile to pepper and espresso. At 60% Cabernet and 40% Malbec, it's worth the price.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"Leather, dark fruit and citrus peel make for a good nose, while the palate is meaty and a bit heavy as it pours on those classic dark-fruit flavors that Malbec is known for. Best to get at this one now because neither the palate nor the finish shows much acidity. A touch hollow.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big and jammy, and all in all it's a solid, good Malbec. Aromas of tar and prune give way to plum and blackberry flavors. On the finish, it's a touch salty and drying, but with food it will be smoother. Good for the money, although limited in depth and complexity.",Malbec
Argentina,"Solid, ripe and smooth on the nose, then red cherry and raspberry come forward on the zesty, tangy palate. The finish is long and healthy, but a bit monotone in its delivery. Freshness and pop are not lacking in this young Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Finding affordable but good Cab is not an easy chore, so let this solid, smoky wine fit that bill. The nose is like a cowboy campfire, complete with hickory, leather and cured meat. The palate is full-force and tannic, with plum and berry fruit. It may be slightly cooked and not for the long haul; so drink now.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Clove and other challenging aromas greet you, and never does this blend of Malbec, Cabernet, Bonarda and Merlot get it fully together. The palate seems a little reduced and short on feel, and while it widens and softens on the finish, the ride to get there is bumpy. Expect better in 2005.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Dark in color, with creamy aromas that hint at prune and chocolate. And while the wine is certainly soft and saturated, it isn't overly flabby. Still, it's ultraripe tasting, with rich blackberry and fudge flavors. Nocturnal in style, which is perfect for the jaguar (Yaguareté).",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark on the nose, with baked black-fruit aromas, graham cracker and charcoal. There's creamy oak on the palate, while the cherry, plum and herb flavors are pleasant. Finishes with fresh-roasted coffee notes and a wave of leftover acidity.",Malbec
Argentina,"Airy floral notes and a whiff of strawberry on the nose give this wine a lighter outlook, yet the palate is still fairly full-bodied as it offers ripe blackberry and chocolate flavors. Maybe a touch herbal here and there, but geneally speaking this is a solid, chewy Cabernet. 10,000 cases made.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Despite being a bit fiery on the nose, the aromas of plum and pepper come together and set the stage for solid, well-meaning black cherry and cassis flavors. First and foremost, the wine is healthy and sturdy. Beyond that, don't expect much in the way of richness or complexity.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Crisp aromas of wet stones, lime and eau de toilette give this Torrontés the proper air. It's lean and cut in the mouth, with green apple, pear and nectarine flavors coasting on a wave of bracing acidity. Finishes clean as a whistle.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Rubbery and a bit herbal on the nose, with a smack of rhubarb-like sharpness offset by deeper, more common berry fruit aromas. The palate is chunky and sweet, with meaty plum and blackberry flavors that lead to coffee and mocha on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Strong and extracted, and needing a few minutes to settle. The palate is concentrated, dark and chewy, with ripe berry flavors that hint at being medicinal and raisiny but don't fully go there. While this is nothing earth-shattering, for $12 it's complete and should offer mass appeal.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Earthy, spicy and rich on the nose, but then quite gritty, tough and tannic on the palate. Flavors of black cherry and dark plum are thick and sweet, while the finish rests on roasted, dark berry fruit. Solid as a rock, warm, baked and sweet.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Solid, basic Malbec with plenty of fruit and power. The palate is plump, mildly oaked and tastes of honest plum and blackberry. It's ripe and round, with medium tannins and then spice, licorice and black fruit on the tail. A very good wine with no skipped beats.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tight, rubbery and smoky at first, and then it shows more vanilla and sweet berry fruit after it has opened up. The mouthfeel is nice and fulfilling, while the flavors of black fruit, nutmeg and mild toast are pleasing. Nothing too exotic or out of the ordinary here. Just good red wine at a good price.",Syrah
Argentina,"Mostly it's clean and neutral smelling, but there is a bit of candle wax and peach to the nose as well. The palate is fresh and not too weighty, with melon, sweet apple and honeyed flavors. A solid wine, especially for the price range and origin. Don't expect miracles and it should be pleasing.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Ripe, healthy and pure, with familiar aromas and flavors of cassis and berries. In the mouth, it's bright and lively, with plenty of acidity but no sheering, harsh qualities. Finishes well, and as a whole it shouldn't raise any complaints while it may please value hunters and fans of Argentina.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A little jammy and heavy at first, but airing gives it better focus. The palate runs full and lush, with sweet tannins running alongside blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors. Holds it together on the finish, but overall the wine is more generic than individual.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A veneer of oak and aromas of root beer greet you, while cherry and raspberry flavors work the palate. It's a lively, tannic wine with a candied, slightly resiny/minty flavor profile and finish. Best with food.",Malbec
Argentina,"Plum, blackberry and other fruit aromas work the nose, which is light and airy more than deep and concentrated. The palate is also a touch thin for a reserve-level wine, but the fruit is clean and the finish offers both chocolate and black pepper.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Starts out good, with menthol and wintergreen dominating the nose. The palate is forward and endowed with a lot of red-fruit flavors, but the mouthfeel lets it down. There's too much bounding acidity and not nearly enough lushness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Mocha, coffee and other oak-based aromas are front and center on the nose. The palate is quite sweet and rich, with cola and dark fruit flavors. Generally speaking this wine has the right qualifications to make a positive impression; it is, however, oaky and on the stewy side. Imported by Kysela Pere et Fils, Ltd.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Don't let the bright purple color and plum/prune aromas fool you: the wine looks deeper and fleshier than it is. In fact, while the palate deals heft and tannin, the depth of fruit is modest and the final package winds up being uncomplicated, but in a good way.",Merlot
Argentina,"Light fragrances of talcum powder and apricots lead off this mild-mannered blend, which runs easy and smooth before thinning out on the back palate and finish. But along the way there's good citrus and green-fruit flavors backed by adequate acidity. A good quaff for the price.",Chardonnay-Viognier
Argentina,"Good out of the blocks, with full and creamy berry aromas. The palate doesn't exactly follow that lead as it shows slightly tart red cherry and cranberry flavors. And by the finish there's even a lemony tingle. Best if you like a juicy style.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,A bit jumbled and certainly it goes heavy on the oak. But as things settle you'll find buttery vanilla notes accenting relatively solid berry fruit. The end result is pretty good. Give it some air.,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
Argentina,"La Vuelta means “the return,” and after a glass or two of this, and with modest expectations, you may want to return to this lighter-styled Malbec. Flavorwise, we're talking strawberry-, cherry- and raspberry-infused tea, while light but noticeable oaking yields finishing notes of mocha.",Malbec
Argentina,"Argentinean Rieslings come along as often as Haley's comet. But this clean, round wine is pretty good in its own right. It features dry almond, white pepper and apple flavors, with additional almond skins on the mineral, lean finish. Not entirely a novelty with 1,550 cases total production.",Riesling
Argentina,"With varietally correct aromas and nice overall balance, this ranks as a solid, fairly legitimate Argentine Viognier. Hailing from warmer San Juan province, this is a citrus- and honey-based white with size, spice and mouthfeel. For the most part it gets things right.",Viognier
Argentina,"A chunky, deep-fruited Malbec that is all about blackberry fruit. There's no funk or odd, floral, overcropped aromas here; instead, it's focused on roasted blackberry flavors, a natural herbal character, and coffee and mocha on the finish. Emphasizes size and friendliness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smoky and floral on the nose, and then thick and ripe in the mouth, with syrup to go with medicinal berry flavors. It's chewy and dense, with chocolate, cream and vanilla to the finish. A bit plodding, but its full weight, feel and depth of fruit push it along.",Malbec
Argentina,"A blend of charred oak and violets lead the bouquet, which also offers some floral berry. The palate is lifted, medium-weight and juicy, with boysenberry and cherry flavors. Very nice if you like a floral Malbec with bright berry fruit as opposed to something dark, meaty and oaky.",Malbec
Argentina,"Give this young Malbec some time to settle and it rounds into form. The nose goes from funky to finished in a few minutes, while the cherry and cola flavors run with ease toward a lightly tannic finish. Straightforward and likable once it finds its legs.",Malbec
Argentina,"Hailing from San Rafael in southern Mendoza, this wine—named after a shade-providing tree—is interesting and different from the masses. The nose is floral and herbal, with pencil eraser and red-fruit aromas, while the mouth is earthy and sort of Old World, with dry, lean tannins and structure.",Malbec
Argentina,"Soft and composed bouquet, with fruit aromas you will recognize and nothing funky or strained. The mouth is complete and better than ordinary, with pure but simple cassis, blueberry and plum fruit. A hint of oak allows for coffee and mocha to grace the modest finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Looks good in the glass, and with citrus essence, plum and cherry aromas, and spice notes it offers a controlled but pleasant bouquet. Cherry, plum and spice flavors work well with the wine's racy acidity and solid structure. Powerful and toasty on the finish.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Sweet, intriguing aromas of orange peel, spearmint and boysenberry jam give this individuality, while the flush palate serves up soft but ripe plum and berry flavors. Uncomplicated, with weight and adequate freshness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big and bulky, with a mixed bag of aromas that includes field scents, rubber and baked fruit. The palate deals berry and plum flavors, while the finish tilts toward heavy and medicinal. Seems like this one got a bit overripe and sticky. The 2003 was better.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Nice on the nose. The palate is steady but on the leaner side, with prickly tannins joining berry fruit, chocolate and toast. A tighter, Patagonian style of Malbec, meaning it's firm as opposed to lush.",Malbec
Argentina,"For an everyday red that won't wreck the wallet, this juicy, fresh Malbec qualifies. It offers sweet aromas of plum and berry, and the palate follows suit with blueberry and blackberry. The depth and complexity are limited but the fundamentals and enjoyment factor are measurable.",Malbec
Argentina,"A little choppy and tannic, with thin red-fruit aromas. The palate is of medium depth, with a bit of tannin-driven rawness to make things a little harder than ideal. Otherwise it's steady and warming.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"An elegant, better-than-most Torrontés with floral, tropical aromas sitting in front of melon, lemon and lychee flavors. The texture and weight suggest melon, and the finish has just the right level of glycerol and grab. Very nice Torrontés that manages to distinguish itself.",Torrontés
Argentina,"An extracted, full-bodied style of Malbec with blackberry aromas, density, meatiness and heft. It's thick and a bit awkward, especially early on, and then a roasted berry quality takes over. Solid as a rock, somewhat floral and young, with good kick at the end.",Malbec
Argentina,"Quite tropical on the nose, with aromas of pineapple and passion fruit. The palate is a soft, honeyed bowl of kiwi, melon, cucumber and white pepper, while the finish is dry and gets more hollow as the wine warms up. Not a classic Sauvignon, but it has its virtues.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Stick with Sur's basic 2005 Malbec because it's fresher and cleaner than this raisiny, tannic brooder that tastes a little too much of stewy fruit and liqueur.",Malbec
Argentina,"California winemaker Patrick Campbell makes this perfumed, unusual Chardonnay, which is challenged but ultimately proves its worth. While it's nothing like Burgundy or other varietally correct Chards, it does show sweet melon, mango and other candied flavors. More for those wanting a simple, sweeter style.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"This Patagonian Malbec requires patience and forgiveness. The nose is milky and green at first, but airing paroles riper, redder aromas and flavors. Ultimately there's decent berry character and plumpness but not a lot of follow through or finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cabernet may always struggle to achieve ripeness in Patagonia, but Schroeder is getting pretty decent plum and blackberry character out of this wine. The mouthfeel, however, runs kind of hard and sheer. May get better in future vintages.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Plenty of patience is required with this wine, because at first it's rough and stewy, with herb and tomato aromas. Airing reveals a blackberry core and tannin-infused oak notes, while the finish features mostly char and vanilla. Has its merits but also some weaknesses.",Merlot
Argentina,"A little buttery and wayward, but not without its good points, which include ripe apple, melon, citrus and papaya flavors. The body is fairly hefty and the finish carries heat, but overall offers decent fruit-salad flavors and pretty good balance.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Aromas of lychee fruit, pineapple, nectarine and baby powder are fairly typical and welcoming. The palate offers bright but somewhat nondescript flavors that ultimately tilt toward melon. The finish hangs in there, showing moderate grace and length. All in all this is decent Torrontes from La Rioja, a province to the north of Mendoza.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Opens with brambly, leathery aromas; later shows some true Tempranillo character, namely body, tannin and dark-fruit flavors. This is not flawed, but it is rather oaky and demanding.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Minerally peach aromas keep things lean to start, and it's somewhat narrow in outlook throughout. The palate has melon, nectarine and papaya fruit, and there's both citrusy acid and custardy richness to give modest complexity. Like a green-fruit lollipop in liquid form.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Jammy and rubbery on the nose, but undeniably bold and friendly as well. The palate is what we'd describe as “happy,” meaning it's full, not too tannic and tasty. Flavors of cassis and ripe plum offer some fatness, and the finish is easygoing. Uncomplicated and good as a value wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark in color and that's backed up by deep earthy aromas and black fruit. In the mouth it's full and sweet, with baked fruit, chocolate and coffee flavors. Finishes with rich berry and molasses notes, and for a candied, sweet-styled Cabernet it gets the job done.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dark and a little baked on the nose, with prune, fig and earthy aromas. The palate is a bit hard and reduced, with pounding tannins, but the fruit is equally big and ripe, so it all seems to be correct. Mellow on the finish, with a hint of chocolate. Good Merlot for the price.",Merlot
Argentina,"Not a bad value. The wine is a touch reduced and short on mouthfeel and aromatics, but it still delivers creamy vanilla flavors, raspberry essence and decent density. The sum of all its parts is better than the individual components. Best now, and in casual settings.",Malbec
Argentina,"Better than jug wine even if it comes in a big bottle, with clean, lightly expressive cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. There's a little heat and roughness to the finish, but given the league that it's playing in you can't complain about the overall quality of this Mendoza Cabernet. A big-time barbecue or party wine.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Opens with a smoke shack full of hickory and jerky before settling in a dark mass. The palate is sweet and a touch awkward, with heavy Port-like weight and strange but provoking berry flavors. An odd blend of Malbec, Cab and Syrah that needs fine tuning.",Red Blend
Argentina,"For the price, this is pretty good. Not very Syrah-like, but if you enjoy plum, cherry and currant flavors along with pretty good mouthfeel and balance, you'll get it here.",Shiraz
Argentina,"Warm, earthy, leathery and grapy, with a mildly tart, underdeveloped palate that offsets any roughness with a blanket of creamy oak resulting in flavors of berries and milk chocolate. With more focus, riper fruit and less oak, this wine could better.",Malbec
Argentina,"Almost sugar-beet sweet on the nose, with a good dose of oak and size. The palate is expectedly big, but with fairly hard tannins and limited depth of fruit. Ultimately there's not much cushion, so it seems hard.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Black Label is a step up the quality ladder for Las Moras, based in San Juan. And this wine is full and chunky on the nose, with blackberry and plum-based aromas. In the mouth, it's more racy and oaky, teetering on sharp. But the freshness it boasts bodes well for pairing with meat, and the aforementioned oak lends a hint of cappuccino to an otherwise snappy finish.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Interesting enough on the nose, with aromas of cotton candy, charcoal, lemon peel and coffee. The palate deals the usual suspects for Cabernet: cassis, plum, tobacco and herbal accents. Competent as a whole and probably a bit above average.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Fruity but common on the nose, and acidic and sheering on the palate. No matter how many times you slide this across the palate, it seems tangy and electric. In the midst of all that zest there's bright plum and berry flavors followed by a lively finish. Tasty and cleansing, but choppy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Despite some initial sweet gummy aromas, things settle into form on the nose. In the mouth, raspberry and cherry flavors are almost in the bubblegum range but are more complex and true than candied. With freshness, nice tannins and decent structure, this wine is giving about all it can.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smells distinctly of cherry cola with a dash of lemon peel. The palate is medium-bodied at its richest, with red-fruit flavors of raspberry and cherry. As a whole it's colorful and easy to like, even if it finishes sort of thin but fresh. Good intentions; low on stuffing.",Malbec-Syrah
Argentina,"If you like a muscular, sweet, full-bodied wine with chunky wild berry flavors topped with a dollop of raisin and chocolate, this is it. It has lower acidity and therefore size and richness. For some it may be syrupy and less than exciting; others will enjoy its ripeness. Drink this year.",Syrah
Argentina,"A nice, highly affordable bottling that highlights Argentina's value potential. The palate is soft, almost silky, with melted tannins and full flavors of raspberry and ripe plums. There's even some toasty warmth to the finish. A textbook easy rider.",Malbec
Argentina,"A good effort for the money. The nose has rubber and bold fruit, while the palate has a natural, balanced feel and nice flavors of berry, cassis, brown sugar and chocolate. Blends juiciness with enough weight and sweetness to rate highly in the value class.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Starts out with nice black cherry and cassis aromas before transitioning to roasted plum and prune flavors that come with sticky, fierce tannins and plenty of heat and grab. A very big and hard wine with midnight darkness but little subtlety. Finishes with sweet flavors of caramel and brown sugar.",Meritage
Argentina,"Slightly hard and herbal at first blush, but exhibiting more purity and depth of fruit as it opens. Flavors of sweet berries and plum are generic but welcome, and the palate is full and tannic. Overall it's pretty well stacked with fruit and power; it's also tannic and stout.",Malbec
Argentina,"Nicely aromatic, with all that's good about affordable Malbec from Argentina: bold fruit, depth and some richness. The palate is plump and stocked with tasty blackberry, plum and raisin flavors, while the finish is sturdy and subtle. A good wine that should not offend anyone.",Malbec
Argentina,"Jammy aromas of strawberry and raspberry are just solid enough to win you over, while the flavors of red fruit and cola carry a bit of tang and acidic bite. This is a fresh, lively everyday wine with sweet, standard flavors and a basic, competent mouthfeel.",Malbec
Argentina,"Full on the nose, but there seems to be some brett resulting in aromatic hints of hard cheese and leather. There's energy on the palate, with lemony notes preceding core flavors of cola, cassis and kirsch. Ripe and sweet, but with nothing out of the ordinary. Good Cabernet for the price, but not what you'd call interesting or exciting.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Saucy and sulfuric at first, but better with time. The palate amounts to a saturated fruit bomb with grip, while the core flavors of cassis and black fruits are very sweet and chunky. Bulky, broad and on the cusp of syrupy. Ripe and ready but maybe too ripe and creamy for its own good.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Some barrel influence works its way onto the largely natural bouquet, while the flavors of peach, banana and melon surf a smooth, modestly deep palate. This is better than your average Argentinean Chardonnay, especially if you like some tropical warmth and weight. Drink right away to catch its vitality.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Round, simple and easy to enjoy if you don't mind a lack of Viognier typicity replaced by chunky apple aromas and flavors. There's also some citrus and apricot to bulk up the flavor profile. Overall it's a full-bodied but indifferent white. Drink right away for best results.",Viognier
Argentina,"Coconut, green herbs and fresh-cut wood work the nose, followed by fairly herbal berry flavors. There is oak throughout, and mildly coarse tannins, thus the structure is solid.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Bold berry aromas turn a little sweet and simple with airing, while the palate deals plum and berry flavors on a tight, tannic frame. Bright and colorful but fairly rough and basic in what it has to offer.",Merlot
Argentina,"If this isn't one of the strangest, most unique Sauvignon Blancs on the market, then please tell us what is. With a tan/peach color, this wine has its own agenda. The palate pushes peach, cantaloupe and floral notes, but where's the acidity and where's the grassiness?",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Big and colorful, with soupy aromas blended with a waft of heavy berries. The palate is packed with anonymous red fruits, but the mouthfeel is pretty hard and miserly. Tastes reasonably good but has little in common with Spanish Tempranillo.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Floral aromas lead the show, backed by meatiness, minerality and wild sage and thyme aromas. The palate is fresh and young, with edgy but saturated plum and raspberry flavors. Turns more narrow and simple with time, but for a basic Malbec it more than gets the job done.",Malbec
Argentina,"Multifaceted on the nose, with aromas of horse saddle and mulch that give way to cleaner floral and berry liqueur scents. The palate is thick, chewy and on the softer side, while the flavors shows rich berry flavors that hint at syrup. Chewy, with a coffee-like essence to the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Black cherry and a light floral perfume get this generic Cab going in the right direction. The palate is healthy but not heavy, while the flavors of red berries and currants are tasty but anonymous to the point that it's hard to identify the wine as Cabernet Sauvignon. Still, it's smooth, fruity and easy to drink.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dark, robust and slightly medicinal, with a bouquet that's not run of the mill. The palate is juicy and jacked up on acidity, so we find live-wire cassis, berry and chocolate flavors that aren't quite as integrated as they should be. And it finishes slightly hot and sticky. Expensive for a wine that's all over the map.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"It's been many years since we've reviewed a Q Cabernet from Zuccardi, and this one is typically oaky, with plum, raisin, rubber, pepper and roasted fruit on the nose. The palate is tannic and firm, with meaty, grabby berry flavors offset by mocha, vanilla, caramel and other wood-driven flavors. Good wine but it comes with some bite and burn.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Large and ripe on the nose, with rubber, leather and rusticity. The palate is juicy and quick, with medium-weight tannins that frame lively cherry and blackberry flavors. Finishes earthy and dark, with length. A solid effort that should go well with steak and lamb skewers.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Septima's first crack at making a big wine leaves us intrigued but not thrilled. This is dark, meaty, saturated and most of all heavily oaked. It smells like coconut and veneer, while the rich, bulky palate is packed with resin, vanilla, cinnamon and blackberry. The blend is Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Tannat, and it could stand to be more refined and balanced than it is.",Red Blend
Argentina,"After starting out somewhat murky and muddled, it gets to better footing. The palate is thick and meaty, with sweet, semibaked fruit flavors and a handful of carob nibs. More carob and an herbal element work the finish, and overall the wine is good and substantive even if it doesn't stand out.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A very rich, sun-drenched style of Malbec that smells like a chocolate-and-fruit candy bar and tastes like ripe blackberry, raisin and pie filling. With a finish of licorice and pepper, this comes on as a dense, Porty Malbec with tons of fruit but questionable balance. Best for those who like their reds big and rich.",Malbec
Argentina,"Once you cut through the heavy, minty oak, there's a decent wine hiding in the folds. The body carries reasonably ripe black cherry and raspberry flavors as well as plenty of wood-generated tannin, but does it taste much like Syrah? I find it more generic and woody than varietal.  Imported by Excelsior Wine & Spirits.",Syrah
Argentina,"Earthy and mildly lactic on the nose, with tight, lean, herbal flavors. Doesn't rise above mediocre.",Malbec
Argentina,"This colorful, clumsy wine shows glaring powdered-drink and candied cherry aromas and flavors, and while it's kind of scouring and rough it manages to make its mark via its juicy ripeness. Not a stellar wine but has its merits; the blend is Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Bonarda.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Holds it together for the most part, but this isn't what you'd call a focused or interesting wine. The nose is mildly fruity, while the palate is shapeless and doesn't deliver recognizable Chard flavors. It rates as a generic dry white wine with hints of melon and peach.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Mildly grassy and dilute on the nose, with sweet, candied berry flavors and a sticky, woody finish. It's fairly full in the mouth, but it lacks the precision, darkness and focus of a top-flight Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Most of Bousquet's wines are enigmatic. They show some good qualities but also signs of overcropping and underripeness. That said, this wine is typical: it's scattershot in its delivery of green-infused berry fruit, tannins and wood. It's O.K. but never settles down. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Can't say that the heavy dose of oak on this wine is helping the cause. The nose is quite resiny and cloying, while the palate is creamy and full, but loaded with wood chip and vanilla flavors. As might be expected, even more oak flavor dominates the finish.",Chardonnay-Viognier
Argentina,"Simple jammy aromas lead to a hard, acidic palate offers some red fruit flavor but also an undercurrent of field greens. A lasting streak of bell pepper on the finish doesn't help bring it around.",Merlot
Argentina,"With aromas of talcum powder, gardenia and lychee, this offers classic Torrontés aromas. The palate is wet, refreshing and not at all heavy, and the flavors of gooseberry, lychee and lemon are simple but nice. Good, tasty and clean, which is all you can ask for from $10 Torrontés.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Shows pretty good concentration and depth on the nose, where it only slightly hints at the herbal character that comes later. The palate is a touch astringent, with cola, blackberry and herbal flavors. Persistent on the finish, but also herbal and not overly complex.",Malbec
Argentina,"For a five-grape blend priced like this, Don Tiburcio is well worth a go. The nose is rich and jammy, much like berry marmalade. The palate is on the heavy side, with sweet flavors of raisins, prune and chocolate. Rich on the finish, with fig and black plum as well as candied accents and tannic leftovers.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Opens with bold, cuddly black fruit aromas, which are backed by a palate of driving tannins and dark berry and chocolate flavors. Not a lot of complexity or angles to ponder, but the wine's fruit content and mouthfeel are both more than good for the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"Mint and heat on the nose give way to baked dark-fruit aromas and earth. The palate is warm, structured and solid, with solid raspberry and plum flavors. Slightly creamy and candied on the finish, with coconut from the barrel and a final blast of heat. Not a wine for aging; drink now with food.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A fuller-bodied wine with round, cidery aromas and a whack of wood resin. The palate is spherical and honeyed, with apple, pineapple and nectarine flavors. For Argentinean Chardonnay it's well made and respectable, but at $20 it's not going to turn many heads.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Ample red plum and cassis both on the nose and palate makes this a proper Malbec wine. However, it's juicy and a bit acidic on the tongue, which makes the plum core a little shrill. Overall it's lively, mildly herbal, honest and gets the job done. Definitely falls into the fresh and snappy category.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dense, robust and a little jagged, with violet, graphite and blackberry aromas that stir interest. The palate is ultraripe, a touch saucy and thick, and full of black fruit and chocolate flavors. Short on the finish but a good carry over from the nose and palate. It sits on the cusp of being overdone but manages to hang in there.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cherry and plum-like aromas carry a dry, dusty edge and some stem, but as a whole this wine is light on its feet, easy to drink and proper. The flavors are quite red in scope, with a twinge of buttery oak adding softness. Licorice and another tick of wood take care of the finish. A fresh, forward wine for everyday use.",Malbec
Argentina,"Licorice, dark spice and berry pie right down to the buttery crust make for a decent nose. In the mouth, it's creamy and warm, with full-bodied plum and raisin flavors alongside a shot of acidity and chocolate on the finish. Not very complex but it delivers the basics.",Malbec
Argentina,"This old-timer proves that Argentinean Malbec is not a great cellar dweller. This smells, tastes and feels much older than its eight years. It's full of tobacco, dried spices and a dominating leafiness. The blend is 70% Syrah and 30% Malbec.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Rubbery and overly woody, and the palate really burns along with high acidity and short, staccato fruit flavors. Zesty and challenging throughout; it just doesn't push the right buttons given its reserve status and price.",Malbec
Argentina,"This Tempranillo is leafy and leathery, with light raspberry aromas backed by thin plum and berry flavors. It's an aggressive, standard red wine that's neither here nor there.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"With little to compare it to, it's hard to evaluate the correctness of this Semillon sweetie from Argentina. Let's just say that it's a weird wine that carries a vivid yellow color and aromas and flavors of honey, corn syrup and hominy.",Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Sweet berry aromas are also noticeably green and medicinal, while the palate offers raspberry flavors with a giant supplement of leafy, weedy flavors. On one hand the wine has some class and style; on the other hand questionable purity and ripeness stand out.  Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Merlot
Argentina,"This Cab is sheer and tannic, with red plums and stern berry flavors. Adequate initially but the heat and tannins soon cover the palate.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dormant and a bit chemical on the nose, with rubbery fruit and a lean body. Woody and borderline hot on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"Clean but weightless, with little substance or stuffing to it. This is a cool-climate, Patagonian Chard from young vines, hence it is reticent and watery. The winery's pricier Patagonian Select is a better option.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Something seems afoot with Sur de los Andes' so-called Gran Reserva Malbecs. Both the 2004 and epecially this '05 are wines that don't handle their oak well. This wine has an aromatic package of green tobacco and ash, while the wood burns its way through the palate. A rough ride that gets marginally better with a lot of swirling and patience.",Malbec
Argentina,"Competent from the start, with well-formed fruity aromas of raspberry and plum. There's even some leather and dried cheese to the nose. In the mouth, it's all about earthy, intense berry fruit and juicy freshness. Finishes a little tart but lively, with good form and feel.",Malbec
Argentina,"Standard all the way, but isn't that what we want from a $9 wine? The nose offers raspberry and strawberry aromas, while the flavors are generic but familiar, with a lean toward cherry and berry. Solid on the finish, and fairly intense as a whole. Imported by Clock Tower Imports.",Malbec
Argentina,"Heavy, inky and seemingly a bit overripe, with grassy, doughy, cake-like aromas. The palate is simple and soft, and it comes with deep berry, candy and herbal flavors. More herbal on the finish, with coconut entering the picture.",Malbec
Argentina,"A big step up from previous failures, this vintage shows tropical fruit aromas and some sea breeze. The flavors are of pineapple and tangerine, and the acidity is nice. On the finish, the fruit holds and the feel is right. Drink soon to capture the wine's perky freshness.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Lots of red-fruit aromas send it out in familiar fashion, while the palate runs a bit zesty and acidic. This is not as soft and rich as in the past; the flavors rest on bright plum and cherry fruit with plenty of acidic kick. Solid but regular as Malbec goes, and probably in need of food to give the acids something to work on.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with sweet berry aromas that are inviting yet generic. The palate has plenty of acidity, making this Merlot food-friendly but racy on its own. Flavors of black cherry and dark plums are juicy, and there's a touch of spice and chocolate late.",Merlot
Argentina,"Cherry and plum aromas carry the mildest touch of stem, yet the palate is reasonably stocky. Cherry and chocolate flavors may seem slightly confected, but given the wine's price it's hard to register many complaints. A creamy and flavorful finish makes this well worth the money.",Malbec
Argentina,"With solid peach aromas and an otherwise clean nose, this llama is worth the ride. Peach and honeydew flavors are sweet but not cloying or mucky, and there's even a hint of spicy white pepper to give the finish character.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Light, semisweet aromas of cherry show a modest level of concentration, while the palate is a bit rubbery and delivers good but regular cola and cassis flavors. There's a wave of milk chocolate to the fairly smooth but basic finish, and overall it's fine but doesn't get you excited. Only 250 cases made.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Sweet, candied and ever so slightly green on the nose, with generic but fairly solid cassis and berry flavors coming next. The feel leans toward gritty, while the finish is of moderate length and depth. Like a million other Cabs, but still o.k. for everyday drinking.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A gamy, slightly stemmy and rubbery style of Bonarda that reflects the variety, Mendoza's terroir and the vineyard. Which doesn't mean that it's great; far from it, the wine is good but stemmy, with green-ish notes and reedy accents infiltrating the red-fruit flavors that control the palate. Solid and structured, but still it leaves something to be desired.",Bonarda
Argentina,"The nose is a dark, clumsy confluence of rubber, stewed cherry and horseradish, and the palate is both tangy and bouncy, with a hard feel and plenty of acidic kick. Misses too many marks to rate better.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"This variety doesn't seem to have adapted well to Patagonia. For starters, it has virtually no inherent Sauvignon Blanc character: it's oaky, sour and scratchy, with a lean and watery finish. It's not a foul or dirty wine; but it isn't what we've come to expect from SB.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Candied fruit aromas lead to a hard, underdeveloped palate that houses tannin and oddly flavored raspberry notes. Not a lot else to say about it.",Malbec
Argentina,"Hot and earthy up front, with mocha-like aromas. The palate and finish are syrupy, and the wine ends in a pool of chocolate and berry extract. This is an example of why Argentine Syrah has not found its groove.",Syrah
Argentina,"What else can you say about this three-grape blend other than it's heavily oaked and doesn't have the fruit or complexity to handle it? The bouquet is like a trip through the sawmill, and the palate is akin to biting into a log.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Flat and soupy, as if the life had been drained out of it. Barely acceptable, even with a big production of 40,000 cases.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Too funky, animal and vegetal to recommend. The wine has color and size but the aromas and flavors just aren't that pleasant. Tastes more like rhubarb and carob than fresh berries.",Malbec
Argentina,"It's hard to understand why Santa Julia would want to make an oaked Pinot Grigio in Mendoza, but they did. And we find it as odd and difficult to get through as you might expect. The nose is nutty and full of popcorn, while the palate offers heady, honeyed apricot and peach flavors.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Tan in color, with musky aromas. Flavors of cucumber and citrus alert you to the fact that this is Sauvignon Blanc; because nothing else really does. Overall it's a foxy, musky wine without much SB character.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Quite green and on the verge of deserving the dreaded weedy designation, this Cab fails to show much ripe fruit character even if the mouthfeel is decent. It's like a wet-vintage cru bourgeois Bordeaux.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Rowdy and aggressive stuff; where's the charm and poise, even in a value-priced wine? The nose is rambling and penetrating, while the palate is tart like sucking candy. A raw wine that should be better.",Malbec
Argentina,"By Belasco de Baquedano, this is a chunky, low-acid Malbec with mint, raisin and slightly damp, earthy undertones. The palate is weighty almost to the point of syrupy, while the flavors are of cola and sweet berries. Soft and slightly herbal, but good in a no-fuss sort of way.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rubbery and warm on the nose, with good berry aromas that turn flatter under the microscope. The palate shows sweet, baked berry flavors and brown sugar, while the feel is round, gritty and full of life. Nice for $8.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cola, black cherry and lemony grit mark the bouquet, which is backed by acid-driven, lightly lemony flavors of cherry and raspberry. There's isn't a ton of volume, depth or follow-through to this wine; it is what it is: fresh, tangy and straightforward.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is a straightforward, regular Cab with berry/cherry aromas and flavors. Nothing is out of the ordinary; the palate is bright and focused on simple berry flavors, while the finish has proper feel, lift and power. Shows a good mixture of fruit, acid and tannin.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A chunky wine with a full, round, sweet, tropical outlook. The nose settles on pineapple chunks, while the creamy palate features flavors of baked yellow apple and melon. Finishes upright, which is better than many. Not sophisticated but still good for Argentina.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A nice, regular sort of Malbec for everyday drinking. The nose is familiar, with basic berry aromas that have some sharpness, while the palate is solid if a bit tangy, with lively cherry flavors. Juicy and fresh, although slightly angular in feel. Ages only three months in oak, hence the fruit-forwardness.",Malbec
Argentina,"The Oak Cask in the name is evident in the bacon, vanilla and creamy berry aromas that open things up. The palate, however, is fairly acidic, making the fruit taste bright and feel zesty. Flavors of cherry and plum are distinctly red in character, and the finish is quick and lean.",Syrah
Argentina,"A long with aromas of dried cheese, earth and rubber, there's enough clean black fruit to bring it home. The palate is snappy and fresh, with edgy, lively plum and berry flavors. The finish is short but offers some flashes of quality. Basic but solid Cab.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A big, sweet wine that doesn't have much teeth or bite but is friendly, rich and pleasing. The nose is all about berry fruit aromas and cassis, while the palate is equally gracious in terms of flavor but a little flabby and weak. Finishes with a kiss of chocolate bon bon but little structure or grip. Drink now.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
Argentina,"Sort of sweet and gaseous to start, with rubbery, medicinal aromas. The palate is tight and closed, with warm, crusty dark-fruit flavors, an herbal influence and heat. Thus the finish is a little fiery and peppery, and there's chop and bite to the overall feel. A kitchen-sink blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Syrah.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Jammy stuff, with hints of mint, leather and cotton candy. The palate is basic, with adequate structure and nicely presented berry fruit as well as herbal accents. Sweet on the finish, with some sugary stickiness. Gets better with time in the glass.",Malbec
Argentina,"Starts with bulky fruit and bacon aromas. The palate is sort of rattled and jagged in terms of feel, while the flavors of baked berry fruit slip toward herbal. All in all, it's a pleasant, jammy, friendly, easy-to-drink, generic Cabernet.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Clean white wine, with white-fruit aromas and some prickle. The palate is linear and simple, with nectarine, citrus pith and tangerine-orange on the finish. A good, basic wine with one-dimensionality. Perfect for party time quaffing.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Opening aromas of cola and dark fruits are belied by the tangy, edgy palate that's fresh in terms of its raspberry and plum flavors but not all that deep or complex. A clean, straightforward wine with zest but limited flavors.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Mild, light aromas of apple, toast, mineral and petrol are solid before they evaporate, while the palate is easygoing and on target, with citrus and apple flavors. Without calling it overly exciting or complex, we like the mix of Chardonnay and Viognier because it's lively, fresh and perfectly drinkable.",Chardonnay-Viognier
Argentina,"Lively nectarine and citrus aromas give it early life, and the palate is equally zesty, with tangerine and pineapple flavors. This is good Sauvignon Blanc for Argentina, with plenty of citrus but not a lot of nuance or complexity.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Plump and sweet smelling, with bacon, wood smoke, sawdust and cotton candy aromas. The feel is jammy and the flavors of bacon-infused roasted fruit suggest some forced wood treatment. But overall the wine is satisfying, with pretty good mouthfeel. Approach it noncritically and it should do the trick.",Merlot
Argentina,"Lightly baked and sweet on the nose, which draws you in. The palate is brighter and more austere, with sheer, slightly bland cherry and raspberry flavors. Fresh, clean and bouncy on the finish, but never does it turn the corner toward greater complexity or quality. Good to average overall.",Malbec
Argentina,"A light, mildly stemmy and roasted Pinot with medium body and a solid mouthfeel. While not all that aromatic, the wine tastes of strawberry, raspberry and rhubarb, and there are accents of pepper and herbs along the way and on the finish. Shows good weight and color.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Ripe, pure and dense for a bargain-priced Malbec. The palate is a bit chunky and stolid, but the flavors of ripe berry, chocolate and beef stock ring true and the feel is clean and cushioned. A good but regular wine where the basics are covered.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pretty good and solid for an uncommon blend, but the Chardonnay and Pinot Grigio thrown together results in nice buttercup aromas along with some apple pie and pear. The palate runs sweet but maintains its freshness, and the flavors of apple, pear, melon and powdered sugar come together. A novelty wine that shows the right signs.",White Blend
Argentina,"Not short on intensity but it is a little candied and gummy on the nose. It remains somewhat jammy in the mouth, with a mild creaminess softening up edgy red berry flavors. Good but candied and basic.",Malbec
Argentina,"A little bit baked, but overall it's a good, semirich Malbec with roasted, dark fruit flavors and a backdrop of chocolate. The palate has slightly more acidity than you might expect, so it doesn't come across heavy or out of whack. Regular wine done well.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dense, soupy and a little raisiny, with an overripe quality to the nose. Jammy in the mouth, but on the palate things unwind and improve. The flavors are of ultraripe but not cooked berry fruit, while the finish hints at stewed and chocolaty. Only go here if you like full, rich, sweet red wines.",Malbec
Argentina,"Aromas of roast plum and earth are a bit nutty and muddled, but overall this is a likable and slick wine with soft tannins and ripe candied-fruit flavors. With lushness and cola on the finish, it ends a bit syrupy and sweet. Good but not what you'd call refined or elevated.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Nice on the nose, with masculine, dense aromas of ripe berry fruits. The palate begins snappy and gets more sheering as the wine unfolds; in the meantime, the cherry, berry and plum flavors are more compact than candied. Well-done for Bonarda, but slightly narrow and grabbing the more you get to know it.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Opens with fairly deep blackberry aromas, but there's also a stemmy edge to the bouquet. Generic flavors of baked plum and berry are lifted by slicing acids, while the finish bounces along before ending with some straightforward chocolate and berry notes.",Malbec
Argentina,"Stemmy on the nose, with aromas of rhubarb, pie cherry and sucking candy. The palate is also candied, with a lean, fresh mouthfeel and floral, red-fruit flavors. Not a lot of darkness or concentration, but it does seem floral and refreshing. Shows some heat and scour on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Basic Torrontés aromas of citrus, greens and saline water greet you. The wine is light-framed and rings and zings on the palate. Lemon and green apple share the palate before lime rises up on the finish. A bit clanky but gets the job done when chilled down.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Tropical aromas of pineapple and melon are simple but clean, while the palate is fresh yet a little plump, with pineapple, mango, apple and banana flavors. This one will wet the whistle but it turns monotone on the finish. Drink as soon as possible for maximum vitality.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Yet another solid but unspectacular Malbec from Las Moras. The nose is rubbery and meaty, with leather and barnyardy brett notes. The palate is chunky and fleshy, with blackberry, stem and tobacco flavors. Good structure; mediocre aromas and flavor components.",Malbec
Argentina,"Neutral aromas of apple and peach kick it off, then round citrus and a mild hint of pickled vegetable and apple carry the palate. This is a fleshy, basic Chardonnay with youthful bounce and a touch of additional pickle on the finish. Drink soon.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Robust up front, with bacony aromas mixed with leather, violet, pickle and blackberry. The palate is crisp and racy, with a fresh, acic-driven profile that's dotted with raspberry and blackberry. Has its share of flare but also some heat and unabsorbed acidity.",Malbec
Argentina,"A big, roasted and fiery nose is act one, while act two offers a raisiny palate with black cherry and cassis flavors. This is a saturated, rough, gritty wine that's defined by baked, dark flavors and then coffee and roasted fruit on the finish. A hot-climate wine with integrity but marginal balance.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Starts with thick, raisiny aromas and later perfume and violets enter the scene. But in the mouth it's sort of thick and lumpy, with blackberry and cassis flavors but not much verve, tannin or acidity. Seems top-loaded, without much structure or finish to seal the deal.",Malbec
Argentina,"There's no escaping the wine's funky, leathery aromas that settle on moss and earth. Familiar plum and berry flavors have a touch of stem in the mix, while the finish is full, medicinal and anchored by mildly bitter tannins. Not bad but tastes and feels a little roasted and rough.",Syrah
Argentina,"Opens with light but earthy raspberry aromas and plum, and then it breaks up a bit with airing. The palate is lean but fresh and gritty, with cherry and cola flavors in front of a limited, narrow finish. Run-of-the-mill, which isn't bad given the price.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Powerful but reduced, with gritty berry aromas and a ton of clove on the nose. There's a carry over of the clove in the mouth, and also roasted fruit flavors, wood spice and sweetness. Powerful for sure, but arguably a bit too woody for its own good.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sweet haystack and banana aromas carry some smoke and burnt stalk, while the creamy, tropical palate shows pithy citrus fruit and sweet banana flavors. Tropical on the finish, but also slightly bitter. Solid by Mendoza standards but nothing special.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Pretty well composed on the nose, with a core of blackberry. The palate runs narrow and grabby, but the generic sweet berry fruit is tasty, albeit ultrasimple. Snappy on the finish, with the gritty feel of cherry and grape skins. Good in a basic way.",Merlot
Argentina,"Smoky and rubbery on the nose, with some green oak aromas. The palate has a soft, pasty quality to it as well as flavors of black cherry and mildly roasted berries. Finishes sort of bland and slightly herbal. Good but entirely basic in its approach.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A little flat, but the nose is adequately melony, so give it points for that. The palate is on the plump, lower-acid side, so the green fruit and lychee flavors are fleshy. Finishes solid but soft. Drink this year.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Melon, peach and dusty aromas give the wine a solid but flat bouquet. With soft edges and modest citric acid, it's a little dull and disjointed as it stresses melon and apple flavors. As Argentine SBs go, this is expensive for what it offers.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"The Cabernets here, if you hadn't already guessed, are Sauvignon and Franc. There's a distinct herbal element to the nose, creating a “green” aromatic sensation. Meanwhile, the palate is coarse and on the acidic side, with red-fruit flavors accented by tarragon and oregano. Spicy but hot on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc
Argentina,"Browning in color, with mounds of dry spice, tea and earth aromas, but also a cooked, overoaked quality that doesn't serve the wine well. The palate is plodding and doesn't really evolve, while flavors of brown sugar, obvious oak and roasted berry seem to be fading. Expensive for what's in the bottle.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Powerfully oaked but awkward, with bruising aromas of fresh-cut wood, sawdust and campfire smoke. Amid the woodiness and thick body you'll find roasted plum and berry flavors, but on the finish resin reappears and lingers. Tastes too saucy and resiny to be called “clean.”",Red Blend
Argentina,"Orange peel, green fruits and then not much else make for a standard nose. The palate is full-sized and melony, and so is the plump, sweet finish. There's size, tropical fruit and green banana all over this wine, but not much spine or structure. Drink now.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Not very vivid in color, with aromas of rhubarb, raspberry and red licorice candy. The palate is a touch scratchy, with flavors of cassis and brown sugar but not a whole lot of true Cabernet character. The finish has a slight tannic bite, but overall this is generic red wine to the max.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Early sulfur and rotten-egg aromas are none too attractive, but in the mouth the wine is better. While sweet as sin, the soft, lush palate is a chocolate-lover's dream, and the finish is like mocha ice cream. Low acidity makes the structure sort of weak, but drink it now and that may not matter.",Malbec
Argentina,"Subtle on the nose, with restrained berry, cherry and citrus peel aromas. The palate is a little grabby but mostly fresh in its approach, with flavors of fresh berry fruit. Light and mildly candied on the finish. A no-brainer that's easy as they come.",Merlot
Argentina,"Slightly oily on the nose, with a fair amount of baby powder. The palate is round and wet, but also fairly regular in its intensity and approach. Flavors of green melon run toward fat and easy, while the finish is in the same mode.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Pungent and a little pickled on the nose, with oak and cream coming on a second wave. The palate is composed, normal in feel and shows slightly choppy cherry and berry flavors. Regular but short on the finish. Good wine; nothing more than that.",Malbec
Argentina,"Strawberry, cherry and other red-fruits comprise a thin-styled bouquet, and pretty much the rest of the show follows suit. The palate is of medium weight, without much heft or structure. Flavors of red fruits are lean.",Merlot
Argentina,"Smells like apple blossom and saline solution, and the wet, fresh palate tastes of pineapple and mango. It's a modest Chard in every way, with medium concentration and nectarine and pickle on the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Floral, young and jumpy smelling, with gumball aromas that leave you with the impression that the wine's clarity, balance and purity may be tenuous. The palate is raw but fresh, with simple but snappy wild berry flavors. Not a lot of structure or depth here.",Malbec
Argentina,"In an attempt to ramp things up, Rutini has a wine that's loaded with candied black fruit, tire rubber and a distinct green streak. The palate is all blueberry and sweetness, but it's short, green and terribly basic. And the feel and finish are narrow and scratchy, respectively. Not one of Rutini's better efforts.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"It doesn't take a great brain to figure out that this is a rocking, beautifully crafted international red wine. Mint, spice and chocolate aromas are dipped in lovely new oak, while the palate is all about bold plum backed by coffee and mocha. Stellar now and shows all signs of a wine that will only get better. Imported by Vias Imports.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lemony and stretched on the nose, with resiny oak aromas and a light hint of green. The palate has size, tannin and lots of oak, while the flavors run creamy and woody, with generic berry fruit residing under the surface. Decent for under $15, but an excess of oak creates a one-sided final product.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Like most inexpensive Malbecs, there are some strained aromas here: tire rubber, stemmy fruit and cranberry. But in the mouth it has good body and grab, with roasted fruit flavors and a touch of hickory. Savory and pretty good for under $10.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lychee, melon and peach aromas are straight from the textbook, while the palate is forceful and more acidic than many, with aggressive lemon, lime and white grapefruit flavors. Racy and citric, with a cleansing finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"A bit foxy and stemmy on the nose, with hints of orange that make things seem nervy and stretched. The palate is clumsy and a little tart in flavor, with herbs and zest leading to a wavy but unique finish. Walks to the beat of its own drummer; uncommon for Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"This Reserve holdover from '05 is '0 well-oaked, so there are clear-cut coffee and mocha aromas to go with adequate fruit scents. But the forceful oak leaves a lemony, hammering flavor on top of simple cherry fruit. With some oil and shoe polish on the finish, this wine doesn't impress.",Malbec
Argentina,"Quiet aromas of peach lead to sweet, basic flavors of nectarine and white table grapes. The finish is fleshy and pithy, with some heat and bitterness settling in after initial sugary sweetness. Drink immediately.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Deep purple in color, and soupy on the nose, with a strong hint of lemon. The palate is almost astringent due to elevated acidity, thus the balance of this Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon-Bonarda blend is sketchy. Tastes more like grape juice than fine wine, with a hollow, tangy finish.",Red Blend
Argentina,"The nose is full of dust, cotton candy, peach pit and banana, while the palate is sugary and tastes like honeydew melon and pear. Fleshy and bland on the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Purple in color and smells like sweet fruit, citrus peel and powdered drink mix. Round in the mouth, with generic plum and berry flavors that don't taste all that much like classic Pinot Noir. A simple, bulky wine that's young and probably not going very far.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Earthy and showing clay, milk chocolate, baked cherry and mocha aromas and flavors, and while the wine feels fairly smooth it doesn't do much but lay there on the palate. Kind of heavy, amorphous and seemingly fading, and overall it's a junior version of Salentein's dying Primum Pinot from 2004.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Gaseous and scrambled at first, with leathery aromas that mask the fruit component. Better later on, although it remains sulfuric and leathery, with confused cherry and raspberry flavors. Not much grace or precision, but not an overtly poor wine either.",Malbec
Argentina,"Waxy, lemony and sort of acrid on the nose, and that's followed by fleshy citrus and baked corn flavors. Along the way there are waves of sugary sweetness and pithy bitterness.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Smells like black cherry Kool-Aid, so don't be surprised that it tastes snappy and angular, with flavors of cherry and raspberry. Crisp and lean all the way through, with some grit and scour to the finish. Not much stuffing or size, but generous with the candied flavor.",Malbec
Argentina,"Red-fruit aromas carry a distinct citric edge, while the palate is made up of sweet cassis and cherry flavors along with an incongruent orange essence. The feel is a bit hard and pedestrian, while the finish is quick and ordinary at best.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Aromas of buttercup and sweet pear are acceptable but cheesy, while the palate is wet, vapid and shows nothing but anonymous white-fruit flavors. The finish is dry, hollow and mildly buttery.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Hints of wisteria and lemon blossom give this dilute Chardonnay a respectable bouquet, while the palate is mild and tastes like bites of lemon, apple and orange. There's not much weight or stuffing to it, but it's generally clean and inoffensive.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Fresh like a peach on the nose, with a bit of warm radiator dust. Flavors of lemon and green apple are narrow, and the mouthfeel is limited and indicates that the lifespan of the wine may be short. Citric on the finish, and overall there's just not a lot going on here.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Licorice and char on the nose hint at size and ripeness, but the palate does not deliver. Tart raspberry and red-plum flavors are sweet for a fleeting moment and then decidedly sour, while the finish is bland. Shows a few positives but overall it's too snappy and sharp for Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Baked apple and buttercup aromas get it going in a good way, but the palate doesn't really keep the momentum. It's citrusy but low in acid, while the flavors are simple and narrow as they revolve around citrus fruits. Chunky and soft on the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Tropical on the nose, with floral, lychee aromas that seem more like Torrontés than typical Sauvignon Blanc. In the mouth, the feel is basic, with sweet flavors of lychee, mango and melon. Vacuous on the finish, but overall it's not going to turn anyone off.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"This yellowish SB from Argentina's northern Salta region is a strange bird that has never caught our fancy. This vintage shows melon, peach, lychee and wax aromas, while the palate is both sweet and tart, with a fresh-for-now feel that doesn't inspire confidence that it will last for long. Flat on the finish, and unsusual overall.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Oily and funky on the nose, with a custardy, eggy undercurrent. The palate is oily and dull, while the flavors are of bitter citrus, pith and banana. In two words: not great.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"This wine is herbal and burns on the nose, where aromas of horseradish and tomato sauce don't really work. Flavors of raisin, brandy and black cherry are hardened by fierce tannins and a chemical-like dryness. Rubs like sandpaper on the palate.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Nothing much sublime about Sublimis. The nose is reedy and sweet, with licorice and overripe raisiny aromas. The palate is big and grabby, with clamp-down tannins and hard, crusty raisiny flavors. A bruising red without elegance.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Rhubarb and vinegar on the nose are ominous signs. The wine maintains a briary, sharp personality in the mouth, where red-fruit flavors have an extra juicy feel. Fresh as a cold winter's morning, but is that really what you want from Malbec?",Malbec
Argentina,"Quite the melony wine. It's heavy on the nose and chunky in the mouth. The flavors of cantaloupe and honeydew are weighty, and while it's seemingly portly, there isn't much core to it either.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Aromas of brick dust, sweet spice, rubber and leather are good if you're not seeking saturated berry fruit, while the palate is starchy and grabby, with flavors of stewed berry, tomato, leather and earth. Raspberry is detectable on the thin finish, but so is a soupy flavor. Decent wine with some faults.",Merlot
Argentina,"A little bit funky and unsettled when you pop the screwcap, but soon it finds its floral, blueberry base. Remains superficial and sweet in the mouth, with candied flavors, vanilla and mild oak. Highly regular; could use more concentration and density.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sharp, pickled and sour smelling at first, although it does improve with airing. The palate has a good feel and proper size and roundness, yet the berry flavors are ultraherbal. Some oak and spice is detected on the finish. Unappealing on the nose; better on the palate.",Malbec
Argentina,"At $7 a liter the price might be right, but that's about as far as we're willing to go in praising this boxed combo of Chardonnay with 10% Torrontés. The wine has mushy aromas of corn and hay, while the apple flavors are mealy and bring back some of the baked corn from the nose. Candied on the finish and flat.",White Blend
Argentina,"Heavy and raisiny stuff, with thick but narrow black plum fruit boosted by a streak of acidity that doesn't do much besides make things fiery. Poorly balanced Cab-Malbec, even for box wine.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"Gold in color and heavy, with melony aromas and citrusy, melony flavors that end fast and veer toward bitter. Quite heavy and seemingly on the fade; there aren't many reasons to go here, chief among them the weird blend of Chardonnay and Sémillon.",Chardonnay-Semillon
Argentina,"Past its sell-by date, with mealy aromas and dull flavors of apple and banana. The feel is flat, the acidity is not there, and the finish is bland and a little bitter.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Heavy hayfield aromas are oxidized, and the flavors of almond peel, citrus pith and baked banana do nothing to impress. Not a fresh or healthy wine, if it ever was. Past its prime.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"A step down from the respectable 2007. This vintage of Elsa Torrontés is weak and candied, with a sweet, buzzy almost bubbly palate. Tastes green and soda-like, with scallion and alfalfa notes.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Off the grid and strange smelling, with jumbled aromas that are hard to describe. Exceedingly sour and lean on the palate, with a vegetal finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is one of three new single-vineyard Malbecs from venerable Trapiche, and it proves that with rich, old-vine fruit winemaker Daniel Pi can make ultramodern vino that will please New World palates the world over. This particular bottling is a potent brew of well-oaked juice that shows wintergreen, menthol and a ton of blackberry, black cherry and coffee. It isn't fooling around, that's for sure. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Malbec
Argentina,"Minty, herbal and slightly grassy on the nose, and of course there's berry fruit to boot. The palate has normal feel and balance, with regular red fruit flavors from the currant and cherry family. Lengthy on the finish, but overall it's as basic as they come.",Malbec
Argentina,"Brickish in color, and seemingly thin. Aromas of baked fruit, compost, tobacco, vanilla and burnt coffee are challenging, while the palate is earthy and tastes leafy as well as sweet. On the positive side, it's neither heavy nor overdone. On the negative side, it's thin and on the fade.",Merlot
Argentina,"A little burnt and rubbery on the nose, but with enough lemon and apple to balance things out. The palate is fleshy and soft, with banana and lemon as the lead flavors. Shows a bit of pithy bitterness late, but overall it's good if you like sweet, warm Chardonnays.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Floral but dilute, with mild red fruit scents mixed with herbal fern and juniper aromas. The palate has a good but innocuous mouthfeel, and overall it's fresh but simple, with herbal, generic red fruit and dried oregano flavors.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"In recent years Michel Torino has been making better and better Malbec, and this vintage is the best we've tasted. It offers sweet fruit and marzipan on the nose, while the big, chewy palate is lush and packed with berries, vanilla and chocolate nesting on pillowy tannins. Very chummy and almost lavish. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Malbec
Argentina,"A tough sell at this price. The nose is minty, green and smells of tobacco, spice and fern fronds, while the palate is tangy, clangy in feel and dry. Flavors of semisour, herbal cherry and plum are touched up by sweet oak, but overall it's rather dry and scouring.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Red in color, with neutral aromas of red apple skins. The palate is sticky and weighty, and the taste is akin to fruit punch with tangerine on the side. Tastes o.k. but is too full, chunky and heavy to be refreshing",Malbec
Argentina,"The second wine from Bodega Noemía de Patagonia is an unbridled winner in 2004. It's ripe and saturated, with a warm and spicy nose that blends just the right amount of rusticity with blackberry and plum. Quite a heavyweight with some raw oak, chocolate and mocha. Everything that fans of Argentine Malbec are looking for is on stage here. Imported by Vias Imports.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark purple in color, but more leafy and murky than you'd expect on the nose. The palate has texture and weight, but it's also kind of dull feeling, which matches the wine's chunky, dull flavors. Decent enough, but still too herbal and challenged.",Malbec
Argentina,"Deep and jammy on the nose, and nothing if not potent. But elegance, clarity and sophistication are nowhere to be found as the wine's grapey, soupy, flat character takes over. Bitter on the finish, and throughout there's little to latch onto besides weight and heft.",Malbec
Argentina,"Two vintages of this wine are on the books, and frankly something isn't clicking. After a flat-out weak wine in 2007, this one is showing raisiny, pasty, lactic qualities and too much clumsy sweetness. It's like a cloying ball of blackberry candy accented by bacon fat.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fully oaked, so the nose deals plenty of coffee and maple. Under that there's vibrant red-cherry and cassis flavors amid firm tannins. The finish is solid and spicy, with chocolate folded in. Although it is a bit gritty and hard now, each additional month you hold it the hardness will dissipate. Made of 70% Malbec and 30% Bonarda.  Imported by 57 Main Street Wine Co.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Smells strange, like a bowl of Smucker's raspberry jam or applesauce. The palate is creamy and dull, with flat, jammy, candied red fruit flavors that do little to excite. Finishes with a wave of sweet marshmallow and vanilla.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Salmon colored, with soapy tangerine and nectarine aromas. The palate is watery and soft, with bland citrus and berry flavors. Comes across like a wine cooler that's lost its fizz.",Malbec
Argentina,"Among the new crop of Patagonian Malbecs, this wine shows a sly style. It's not that full of bells and whistles but it does offer plenty of ripe red fruit such as cassis, cherry and strawberry. Blended in are touches of tobacco and leather. Goes down smooth and easy; registers more lush and ripe than anything. Imported by S&F; Trading Company.",Malbec
Argentina,"A rough, harsh nose of mustard and burnt stems does almost nothing to draw you in, while the palate is heavy and sweet, with cloying fruit flavors and weak structure. Not up to par on the global level.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Impressive and saturated, with ripe aromas. The mouth is focused and, generally speaking, quite rewarding. The blackberry and dark plum flavors are big and aggressive. If there's any one place the wine doesn't wow, it's on the finish, which is short and a bit sharp-edged. Needs food. Imported by Billington Imports.",Malbec
Argentina,"Yet again this relatively affordable wine shows the charms and potential of Argentinean Malbec. It has a beautiful color and full, fruity aromas. The palate runs a bit snappy and upright, with cherry-based fruit that will go great with any type of grilled or braised meat. Clean, ripe and tasty, with the slightest bit of perky acids. Imported by Billington Imports.",Malbec
Argentina,"As good as it gets from Argentina. Winemaker Jorge Riccitelli has artfully crafted a bruising but lovable modern Bordeaux blend that hits every note on the head. The nose offers black olive, berry essence and a ton of chocolate, while the tannic but balanced palate sports luscious black cherry, cassis and more. For a stud of a wine, it has nuance and character—meaning it's not just a fat fruitball. At 70% Malbec with Merlot and Cabernet, this is the ideal wine for a great steak. Just 250 cases produced.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Frenchman Bernard Magrez is building a global brand via high-quality, smartly named wines such as this (La Bienvenida means The Welcoming in Spanish). But the cuteness ends there; this is serious Malbec with maple, leather and coffee aromas in addition to rich berry scents. The palate is integrated and deep, with lively acidity and tannins but enough cuddly fruit to ensure balance. An excellent Argentinean debut for Monsieur Magrez. Imported by Bernard Magrez USA.",Malbec
Argentina,"Is there a better, more consistent Malbec on the market today than Punto Final? The 2005 is typically rich and dense, with saturated berry aromas and a strong but balanced oak element. The palate is a potpourri of berries, chocolate and vanilla, while the mouthfeel is juicy and stacked. Quite delicious; this is the type of wine that gives Argentine Malbec its good name.",Malbec
Argentina,"Purple as can be, with a loaded bouquet of black fruit and oak. This is your classic heavyweight, and while 2004 was not a great vintage in Mendoza, this wine still shows excellent depth, weight and balance. Firm on the finish, with big tannins and grab. Production was only 175 cases; drink now–2009. Imported by Southern Wine Group.",Malbec
Argentina,"Attractive and well put together from start to finish. This Cab (with 15% Malbec) is jammed with cassis, raspberry and other juicy berry flavors, while the lushness of the wine rolls over your palate with ease. It's not easy to find Cabernet this good in the $20 range, so get after this one while it's under the radar.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Nothing is hidden in this bruising, forward Cab. The nose is oaky as can be, but also endowed with intense black fruit. The palate might register as soft to some, but there's still a tannic foundation that bolsters blackberry, spice cake and molasses flavors. Not super long on the finish but intense in a lumbering sort of way. Drink now–2011.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This is a delicious and somewhat rare style of Malbec: it has none of the usual oak. What you wind up with is fruity, clean and pure. The body is maybe a touch leaner without the oak; the flavor profile is brighter and more linear.",Malbec
Argentina,"Regal and ready, and showing equal amounts of early maturity along with youthful fruit and menthol aromas. The palate is saturated with raspberry and black cherry, while the lengthy finish offers coffee and chocolate. Drive and power are not in short supply, so take this one with fatty foods like ribs or steak.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rich, warm and possessing a ton of dry oak, this is one serious Argentine Cabernet. The palate is grippy as a rubber glove, with snappy berry flavors and pointed acidity. It's ripe, racy and edgy, with substance to the fruit, feel and finish. Drink now through 2010.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Here's another success from Bodega Norton. The nose is rich and big, with crusty chocolate and coconut aromas. More chocolate blends with blackberry and pepper in the mouth, while on the finish there's sexy layered darkness. It's New World pomp and pleasantness in all its glory.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This wine needs time to get its legs underneath it. It comes on young and rugged and gamy, but if you let it sit and air out for 20 minutes it turns deeper, riper and much more fruity. And by the time it settles you're smack dab in the middle of mountain berry and other natural flavors. Will get better with some bottle time.",Malbec
Argentina,"If you don't mind a little overt wood on your Malbec, then this will certainly do the trick and more. The nose offers some maple and mature berry aromas, while the palate pumps oak-infused black cherry fruit. Lengthy on the finish, with mocha and vanilla. Like we said, it's a bit toasty and woody, but overall it works like a charm.",Malbec
Argentina,"Few Argentinean wineries are doing everyday red wines better than Chakana. A case in point is this excellent, superbly balanced, easy-drinking Cab. The nose is meaty, earthy and magnetic, while the palate is ripe, harmonious and full of cassis and raspberry. It's fruity more than complex, with stature and style.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Color, power, flavor and commendable balance; that's pretty much the format for Punto Final, one of Argentina's go-to brands for Malbec. This youngster is ripe and ready, and it holds form onto a long finish. If it seems a little young and clumsy upon pouring, air it out and it'll improve.",Malbec
Argentina,"Even if this full-bodied Cab starts with some eggy, pastry-like aromas, it soon finds its form. The nose brings char and baked black fruit, while the palate is full of creamy blackberry and brown sugar flavors. Rather rich and ripe, with medium tannins and mild acidity. Drink sooner than later.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Mauricio Lorca makes wine for Enrique Foster but his private label is something to keep an eye on. Poetico is potent and fairly pure; and it contains 10% Cabernet and 5% Syrah in addition to 85% Malbec. The palate delivers hearty blackberry, plum and vanilla flavors, while the finish is sturdy as a statue, with length and firm tannins.",Malbec
Argentina,"In the past this was a Bordeaux blend but now it's all or almost all Malbec. And because it hails from cooler Tupungato it features floral aromas more than heavy berry scents, and in the mouth it's all about red fruit as opposed to beefy black fruit. If it's a bit short on the finish, chalk that up to its racier, more streamlined frame.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pure, jammy and heady: voilà, it's modern Malbec. The palate here is inviting, with decadent plum and blackberry flavors working in tandem. The finish is plush at first, with chocolate and espresso notes coming later. With plenty of virtues, this is a very nice wine from an average vintage.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fast becoming one of Argentina's most reliable value brands, Altosur got it right in 2006 with its basic Malbec. The wine is full, chewy, healthy and bright. It has all the attributes of good, young Malbec: plums, berries and chocolate, with lushness and some style.",Malbec
Argentina,"Starts out sort of soft and shy, with modest red-fruit aromas. In the mouth, raspberry and cherry flavors get a quick lift from grabby, firm tannins. And by the time this baby hits its groove you're onto a finish defined by a starchy feel and long-lasting Cabernet essence. Airing is this wine's best friend; decant or drink over time.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"The bouquet is fairly tight, with aromas of coffee, crushed minerals, crude oil and fine herbs. The palate runs snappier than most high-end Malbecs, but it also delivers on the promise of ripeness and black-fruit flavors. Finishes in healthy fashion, with some slickness and speed. Very nice and likely even better with food. 1,000 cases made. Imported by Slocum & Sons.",Malbec
Argentina,"Here's a nice wine that pushes the right buttons while not raising any red flags. Raspberry and vanilla flavors are solid and pleasing, while the medium-weight palate features depth and balance. This is not the richest, most overpowering Malbec you'll find, but it comes from 75-year-old vines and its virtues far outdistance its faults.",Malbec
Argentina,"Quite earthy and ripe, as tree bark, leather and prune make up the bouquet. The mouth is lively and snappy, with red fruit taking over and holding reign. Sheer, zesty and juicy describes the mouthfeel, while overall the wine delivers depth and integrity. Not overly complex but very good and straightforward.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Good wine, especially if you like some new oak that brings a lot of cream, vanilla and chocolate to the game. Along the way there's plenty of boysenberry, blueberry and other sweet dark-fruit flavors. A winner that should meet the expectations of many.",Malbec
Argentina,"Robust and with a touch of raisin, this full-bodied Cab hits many correct notes. The oak may be a bit buttery and the tannins fairly full, but overall this does a good job of impersonating a much pricier wine; it's big, liberally oaked, ripe and quite good as a whole.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Overt oak is the first thing you encounter on the nose, but underneath the heavy wood covering is a polished and sincere wine. The mouth is lively and juicy, with commendable plum and raspberry flavors. And while the finish is sort of basic in its vanilla and chocolate character, it has a nice feel to it. A wine with virtues but maybe a touch too much new oak.",Malbec
Argentina,"Full and inviting up front, with hickory and leather in addition to dark-fruit aromas. This is a collaboration between two Italian buddies and the wine features black cherry and plum flavors but also rather grabby, heavy tannins. It's ultimately chewy and a bit hard, but still it's eminently satisfying.",Malbec
Argentina,"Still not sure what the difference is between Sur de los Andes and Alma de los Andes (they're from the same winery), but this wine seems a tiny bit more open and friendly than the Alma. It's evolved, sweet and full of blackberry and blueberry flavors. And the finish carries some warm baked notes that anchor the deal.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Santa Julia doesn't try to trick you with its wines. They are what they are, and for under  10 this creamy, berry-packed wine should please the masses. The fruit is plump and ripe, while the mouthfeel is round and healthy. A great model for quality, affordable Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sauvignon Blanc is far from being Argentina's signature grape, so the fact that this one from San Juan province is legitimate, crisp and varietally correct is impressive. Beyond that, the wine delivers true lime, passion fruit and citrus aromas and flavors. Fresh and easy to like.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"If you've never tried Argentine Bonarda, Chakana is a good place to start. The nose offers the varietal's typical vulcanized rubber and dark-fruit aromas, while the palate is smooth and full of straightforward blackberry. Complicated it's not, but it is pleasant.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Dark to the eye and nose, with aromas of rubber, black fruit and lots of sharp-edged oak. Wood more than fruit controls the front of the palate and the finish, but inbetween the folds you'll find plump berry and black pepper flavors. A nice Malbec but arguably a little heavy on the oak.",Malbec
Argentina,"This reserve-level Chardonnay isn't that expensive yet it shows considerably more balance and complexity than the winery's regular Chard. This version offers peach and other stone-fruit aromas, while the palate presents smooth white fruit and toast flavors. Fairly long, with a healthy feel throughout.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"As always, this late-harvest white delivers peach and lychee aromas, and it's even better in the mouth, where intense lychee and pineapple flavors rise up and steal the show.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Like most of Alma's wines, this Bonarda is smooth, fruity and approachable. The nose is simple and offers some spice, licorice and herb notes, while the berry flavors are just as they should be: easy and jammy. There's nothing challenging about this red; just pour it with pizza or burgers and enjoy.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Punchbowl melon and tropical fruit aromas are the lead act. Next up is a zesty palate of green apple, melon and citrus. The body is a bit plump and round, while the finish shows orange peel and lime zest. Good for Mendoza Sauv Blanc.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Warm earth and other dark, leathery aromas dominate. In the mouth, there's black cherry and raspberry flavors supported by scratchy tannins. Despite some grab and clumsiness, this is a good Cabernet with ripeness and a forward personality.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Starts out all rowdy and sweaty, with animal hide and warm earth. And that all makes sense: this is unoaked, unmolested Syrah and thus it has its funky side. Along the roadside there's blackberry and pepper flavors and peppy acids and tannins. An interesting ride that's not without its ups and downs.",Syrah
Argentina,"We've been watching this wine for several years and it doesn't seem to be on the upswing. This vintage is good as Cabernet goes, but it comes across a little racy and jumpy. The mouthfeel runs tight and the tannins are spunky and on the border of being rough. Maybe another year will settle it down.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Simple red-fruit aromas, sweetness and balance come right away on the bouquet, and the palate is basically the same thing: pleasant strawberry and raspberry flavors and a good feel. Nothing fancy but smooth and fun to drink. Commendable given that production is 50,000 cases.",Malbec
Argentina,"Leather, mint and a touch of raisin make for a fairly ripe and mature bouquet. The palate follows with reasonably vibrant berry flavors and a little chocolaty heft. If it falls a bit flat on the tail that only means that it's not for aging and is meant to drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"Spunky and funky on the nose, with some heat and bramble. There's definitely a gamy side to this wine, but as it airs it picks up more of Malbec's trademark feel and fruit. Not as forward and clean as it should be; but has its benefits. Imported by Southern Wine Group.",Malbec
Argentina,"Black fruit and a hint of tire rubber work the nose, and that's backed up by raspberry and sweet vanilla flavors. This wine is pretty good overall, with depth and push, but it's also a bit starchy and slightly green at its core.",Malbec
Argentina,"For an average vintage this is an average wine. It has some bramble, leather and mild green notes to the nose, which are backed by red-fruit and brambly flavors. The feel is fresh and racy due to firm acids. Not the most expressive wine going, but nobody is going to call it flat or flabby.",Malbec
Argentina,"Young and sturdy, with pear and apple aromas enveloped in popcorn and wood. The palate offers standard New World weight and sweetness along with flavors of pear, vanilla and oak. More on the full-bodied, oaky side, but generally it's balanced and approachable.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A little damp and heavy, with molasses, stewed berry and char on the nose. The palate, however, is fairly jumpy and alert; fiery berry flavors hit with force and some heat. On the finish you'll find berry essence and some bramble. Is it slightly green at its core? We think so. Imported by Southern Wine Group.",Malbec
Argentina,"Simple but nice in its class. The nose offers bulky but clean fruit and a touch of saddle, while the palate is ample, fruity and round. It flairs out on the finish but keeps rolling in the right direction. Good for the price.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Getting pricey as Argentine Chard goes, this moderately rich wine has true aromas and flavors, meaning there's some apple, pear and butter to sniff and vanilla-tinged peach and melon to taste. Not as complex or complicated as maybe it should be, but easy to like.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"The wood is a bit forced, and overall this wine has a heavy, full-fruited personality. But the depth and ripeness are pretty nice and the blackberry, dark plum and cassis flavors are earnest. A bit tannic and not all that varietal.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Honeysuckle and other sweet aromas greet you. In back of that there are flavors of pineapple, mango and apple. This runs crisp and tangy with more lemon-drop character than butter or vanilla.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Soft, lightly fragrant and peachy, with a hint of talcum powder to the nose. The palate offers your basic mix of melon and lychee, while the feel is good and there's a persistent finish. Straightforward stuff.",Torrontés
Argentina,The nose kicks off with ripe apple and zest and draws you in. The palate is live-wire pineapple and green apple with plenty of tang and a worthy mouthfeel. Even on the finish it holds the line.,Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Sweet pear and powdered sugar carry the confected nose, while the palate is also on the sweet side, with sugared citrus and banana flavors. Feelwise, there's adequate acidity to keep it wet and juicy, while the finish is candied but not what you'd call sticky. Imported by Quintessential Family of Wines, LLC.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"For an affordable Argentine Chardonnay, this is not a bad effort. But it is a little oily and loaded down with movie popcorn and buttery aromas. Medium in depth, with candied flavors and a peppery bitterness to the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A little charred and bulky, but pretty good for a basic New World Cabernet. The nose is a mix of ripe fruit, licorice and herbs, while the palate is tame and veers to strawberry. Simple and a touch herbal.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Good but sort of generic. The nose exudes strawberry and milk chocolate, and the palate features blueberry fruit and some citrus-like acidity. The mouthfeel is a bit raw and tangy, but overall it is clean and presents itself well.",Syrah
Argentina,"Fading fast; this plump, hot-climate Chard is pretty much as expected: there's lots of oak covering peach, butterscotch and apple cider aromas and flavors. Borderline cloying.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Fairly sweet on the nose, with plum and a touch of spice. Things get more rugged in the mouth, where cherry and blackberry flavors carry a medicinal edge. A big Syrah but also a clumsy, heavy-handed one. Proceed with caution.",Syrah
Argentina,"Some dry oak and smoke frames simple earth and berry aromas, but the mouth is condensed and flat. There isn't much bounce to this overripe red; it's heavy and seems to have caught a lot of sun in the vineyard.",Malbec
Argentina,"Novus' basic Cab is probably a better wine for the money. This one seems to want to justify its reserve status by offering more oak. But that oak carries that creamy vanilla and carob flavor, making the wine sticky. And maybe the raw material is a bit overripe as well.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Intense on the nose and colorful, but in the end this wine shows little character, complexity or style. It's all about color and extract but you don't get much richness, charm or ripeness. And it's almost sassy and tangy on the palate and finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Not sure exactly what's happening at Bianchi in San Rafael. A few years back Bianchi's wines were almost all exemplary but lately they've been all over the map. This overoaked, charred Cabernet is a perfect example of a wine without a cause. It's burnt, herbal and while it has mouthfeel, nothing seems to be working in tandem.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Light and spicy, with snappy, lean flavors of cherry and cranberry. This is more tart and underwhelming than most Malbec fans probably want, but it's not bad if you crave a lip-smacking red with zest.",Malbec
Argentina,"Jammy on the nose, with a touch of hard cheese backing that up. The mouth is jumpy and rustic, with raspberry and cherry skin flavors. Finishes lean, scouring and a bit hard.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Sort of soupy and stewy to begin with. The palate is stocky and forward, with short black plum and berry flavors. Quite ripe on the back end as it finishes chewy and soft. Organic.",Malbec
Argentina,"All in all this isn't a bad little wine for the price. It is a touch musky and heavy on the nose, but the palate holds form as it delivers round banana and melon flavors along with some vanilla and sponge cake on the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A bit heavy and bitter, but otherwise this is pretty decent. Not much can be said about the mild nose: it's typical but not that expressive. The palate, meanwhile, has a lot of weight and peach-pit bitterness, while the finish is a bit sluggish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Warm and oaky up front, with menthol. The palate is short and feels kind of flat as it offers up standard raspberry and other red-fruit flavors. Finishes with milk chocolate notes but overall it doesn't have much texture or personality.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,". Pencil eraser, tomato leaf and sweet fruit aromas are the appropriate set up to a candied palate that's sweet with cherry and strawberry essence. It's a wine with kick but it has also has chunky side.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Rather raisiny and herbal, with deep plum and blackberry flavors. It's a weighty wine with a finish that runs straight to prune and chocolate. A bit heavy and dull even at this everyday price point.",Malbec
Argentina,"Quite syrupy and stewy, with chunky fruit flavors and a lot of wayward heft. On the plus side there's coffee and bitter chocolate, but overall there's just not much elegance or lightness.",Malbec
Argentina,". The citrus and grapefruit aromas come across a little mealy and the wine never really rises above its candied citrus and apple cider qualities. It is pretty good on the tongue, however, and feels juicy. If chilled down it won't be a bad quaff.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,Spearmint and dry red fruit carry the nose. The palate shows basic sweet cherry and strawberry flavors but not much Cabernet character. All in all it's a stripped-back wine that offers rudimentary red-fruit character.,Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Wines can be big and loaded with everything, yet still be hard to enjoy. This is a case in point: It weighs in at 15% and brings searing aromas of tree bark, char and shoe polish. The palate is a saturated fusing of berry syrup, chocolate and alcohol. Almost Port-like in weight and style, but also very aggressive.",Syrah
Argentina,"A stewy Cabernet; the nose mixes cola with Fernet Branca and never does the wine approach anything we might label charming. It's linear and tight, with narrow flavors of cranberry and cherry. Short on texture and never shows much variation.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Vanilla and floral aromas have a suspicious artificiality to them, and in the mouth it's a sweet, sugary ride toward a cloying finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"The bouquet hits with reduced aromas of children's vitamin and pineapple, while the palate goes straight to hard cider and orange peel. It's a firm, acidic style that finishes citric and a touch bitter. Doesn't really smell or taste much like Chardonnay.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Granular and syrupy on the nose, and that same thickness of fruit is resurrected on the palate. Gritty on the finish, and sweet and lifeless as a whole.",Bonarda
Argentina,Nail polish on the nose along with clay will have you wondering. The palate on this organic wine is also a bit shaky; rubbery cherry and raspberry flavors are lean and the aftertaste is fiery. Too unusual and challenging.,Syrah
Argentina,"Ripe to overripe apple grips the nose, while the palate deals one-note citrus flavors. It's a flush, fat Chardonnay that's losing balance with each passing day. Finishes with an avalanche of orange character.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Floral red fruit aromas settle on raspberry and plum, and there's not much obvious oak or darkness. Round and juicy on the palate, with spicy and sweet blackberry along with clove. Integrated and solid, with a lightly toasted, chocolaty finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"On the bouquet it leans toward ripe and heady but there's also a strong herbal and tomato element that creates a green element. Feels full but choppy and tannic, with berry, tomato and spice flavors. Feels warm on the finish, with herbal shadings. Drink now; Malbec with Cab Sauvignon, Merlot, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Tropical aromas blend nicely with honey, peach and fresh-cut hay notes. The palate is focused and properly acidic, with lemon, green apple, vanilla and toasty flavors. Perfectly fresh and easy on the finish, with good citric carry through.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"With ripe yet oaky aromas, this is a basic Malbec to enjoy with simple foods. The palate is juicy but comes with a buttery, creamy feel. As for flavors, look for buttery oak riding on top of modest, quick-hitting berry. On the finish, it's oaky more than fruity.",Malbec
Argentina,"The nose on this Syrah is attractive as it doles out spicy, earthy berry fruit aromas that are typical for the Cafayate region of Argentina. In the mouth, however, the wine is hard and short, with oaky, herbal flavors of roasted fruit followed by green notes and raw oak on the finish.",Syrah
Argentina,"This is a meaty, toasty style of Malbec with heady berry aromas that become gritty with airing. A full and deep palate hosts toasty, ripe plum flavors along with lots of oak, which leaves a toasted and hot finish that's also minty.",Malbec
Argentina,"Concentrated and jammy smelling, with a note of iodine to go with racy black fruit aromas. Dense as night in the mouth, with gamey, roasted berry flavors. Turns minty on the finish, with a hint of herbal green. Fruity and nice but lacks that final gear.",Malbec
Argentina,"Stocky, smoky and well composed on the nose, with aromas of blackberry and hickory leading the charge. Shows pulse and concentration on the palate as toasty oak, chocolate and chewiness blend nicely with black fruit and cassis flavors. Firm, deep and tannic on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This comes out swinging, with bullish berry and prune aromas that hint at being stewy but then pull back. It's saturated and tannic but not rough, with black fruit, chocolate, toast and pepper flavors. Minty and dark, with a licorice note on the finish. Drink now–2016.",Red Blend
Argentina,"This big, lush, friendly and serious Malbec is packed with prune, blackberry and toast aromas. On the palate, it's deep and layered, the perfect bed for flavors of blackberry, chocolate and herb to fill. Huge for sure, but still complex, with dynamite prune and licorice notes on the finish. Drink now–2015.",Malbec
Argentina,"The nose of this Malbec is fresh and shows black-fruit and plum aromas. Medium bodied, with plum, red berry and herbal flavors. Tasty on the finish, this delivers all the basics for $10.",Malbec
Argentina,"This Syrah leads with standard berry and chocolate aromas. The mouthfeel is largely fresh, and while there's creamy oak as part of the flavor package, there's also good berry character and mint.",Syrah
Argentina,"This light, tropical wine captures the positives of Torrontés. The nose offers melon and mango, with no bitter notes. A citrusy, bouncy palate delivers spiced orange and pink grapefruit flavors before finishing juicy and chalky.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Opens with prickly, slightly stemmy aromas. The palate, however, is smooth and round, with chunkiness and roasted flavors of raspberry and plum that are true to warm-climate Pinot. Finishes warm, a bit toasty and chocolaty. Weighty but achieves balance with airing.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Raspberry, leather and baked aromas are the entry to a lush palate that registers as soft and chunky. Baked, savory flavors of bacon, blackberry, mocha and earth finish smoky and with an echo of cured meat. This is warm but not hot or sticky.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"With light, tropical aromas of melon and mango combined with a juicy, clean palate, this is a good PG. Peach, nectarine, melon and papaya flavors finish with citrus notes. Drink this patio white as soon as possible.",Pinot Gris
Argentina,"With hard, rubbery aromas and a lot of black fruit notes, this wine registers as textbook Bonarda. The palate is bouncy and full feeling, but not complex, while flavors of dark fruits, leather and herbs set up a crisp and drying finish.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Woody on the nose, with aromas of tree bark, pepper, cola and black fruit. The palate is tight but under control, with spiced black plum and herbal berry flavors. Toasty and healthy on the finish, but also slightly bitter tasting, with zesty lasting acidity.",Malbec
Argentina,"Full and forward smelling, with generic, slightly hot berry aromas. Feels good and tight, with a firm structure and sweet, lush red berry flavors. Narrows down on the finish, focusing on ripeness and red fruit. Nothing sour or astringent here.",Malbec
Argentina,"Foxy aromas are in the lead, backed by milk chocolate, a pinch of volatility and minty berry. The feel is good, with candied, herbal flavors of sweet berry and cassis. Sweet, sturdy and still a bit foxy on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lean and angular on the nose, with crisp cherry and rhubarb aromas. Surprisingly elegant in the mouth, with citrus notes, zesty raspberry, clean cherry and a lightness of being. Nice in an unassuming way, with a touch of complexity.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Deep, dark and charred on the nose, this features campfire and black cherry aromas. It feels fresh, alert and snappy for being so dark and ripe, with blackberry and padded oak flavors. It's layered and a touch creamy on the finish. A modern, powerful Malbec to drink now–2016.",Malbec
Argentina,"Among Argentinean Chardonnays, Catena's Alta is among the very best. This vintage supplies toasty apple, pear and banana aromas in front of a fresh, full-bodied palate that's clean, pure and Burgundian in character. Flavors of baked apple, oak and spice lead to a long finish. Drink now–2014.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Woody aromas of tree bark, forest floor and earthy, minty berry fruits lead to a full and stocky feeling palate with wiry, herbal, oak-heavy flavors of plum and mint. On the finish, this is tannic, with strong spice notes and a hint of green.",Merlot
Argentina,"This is a clean, basic wine with white-fruit aromas of peach and apple. The palate is well balanced, and there's a good level of citrus flavor along with green herb accents. On the finish, it's more tropical, with a hint of banana.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Herbal aromas are balanced by plenty of red fruit character. It's tough and tannic in the mouth, so food is almost a must. Tastes of herbal berry and stewed plums, and that's followed by a roasted, herbal finish. Tough in feel but honest in flavor.",Cabernet Franc
Argentina,"Full, solid and dishing pretty aromas of blackberry, dark plum and mild spice. Sturdy in the mouth, with nice balance and above-average mouthfeel. Tastes ripe, lightly toasted and it finishes smooth if a bit short. Textbook value Malbec; easy to like.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is a full-bodied, warm-climate Chardonnay with the expected mix of oak and baked-fruit aromas. The palate is more juicy than creamy, but also resiny, with nutty flavors of butterscotch and toasted apple. A banana note enters onto the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Blueberry, boysenberry, minty oak and leather are the key aromas of this full-force Malbec. ViBo emerges with focus and power; it's delivering a truck load's worth of firm berry flavor, finishing dry and alert, with chocolate and herb notes. Drink now–2016.",Malbec
Argentina,"Although the bouquet is a touch scratchy, raspberry aromas are good. This feels a little wiry on the palate, with acidity poking through. Flavorwise, there's a mix of generic blackberry and plum, while the finish is lively due to juicy  acidity.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz
Argentina,"Meaty plum aromas have a floral accent and suggest balsam wood or sandalwood. This feels good in the mouth, with broad tannins. Flavors of herbal blackberry and exotic  spices finish rubbery and firm.",Malbec
Argentina,"Take this wine's deep purple color as a warning of big things to come. A grapy nose with herbal and violet aromas precedes a heavily saturated palate with spice and prune flavors. A pounding, long, plum-driven finish confirms that this mostly about size.",Malbec-Merlot
Argentina,"Eolo is Trivento's prized wine, and this vintage hammers away from the start with blackberry, toast and pepper aromas. The palate is huge and extracted, with dark, fat blackberry flavors that are tempered by graphite and minty oak. It's as black as they come, with mint and licorice flavors on the finish. An inky, intense wine, with less than 500 cases made.",Malbec
Argentina,"This blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot is powerful, with a blueberry flavor, a mild green note, a balsamic hint and a molasses tinge. It's saturated and clampy in feel, with aggressive flavors of lemony oak, balsamic fruit and baked berry. Warm, oaky and full of licorice flavor on the finish. Drink 2014–2019.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Although this is almost red in color and entering its twilight, it's not bad for $8. Dusty berry aromas lead to a semifull palate with raspberry, cherry and plum flavors that end in chewy dryness.",Rosé
Argentina,"Dark berry aromas appear alongside a strong whiff of mint and grass. The palate feels narrow and tannic, with little in the middle, while flavors of earthy berry vie for attention with seemingly out of place citric flavors.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Stout and dense from the beginning, with blackberry and violet aromas. Despite being a bold and dark Malbec, this is fresh and composed, with sweet blackberry and cassis flavors. Good on the finish, with candied fruit and caramel sweetness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with tire rubber, char and minty, smoky black fruit. Feels mostly fresh and bold, with blackberry, blueberry and coffee flavors. Just dense, sweet and spicy enough, with espresso bitterness to the finish. Composed and competent value red wine.",Malbec-Syrah
Argentina,"Black and jammy on the bouquet, with a spot of minty green and licorice. It's softy and leans toward syrupy, with sweet, mildly baked flavors of black fruits and chocolate. Feels creamy and a little low on acidity, so drink soon.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Black in color, with minty aromas of blackened berry, leather and a slight horsey funk. Lush, soft and jammy in the mouth, with roasted, sweet-tasting flavors of stewed berry and raisin. Finishes soft and smooth, with mild tannins and sweet café mocha flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"Shockingly good for $10 Argentine Pinot. It's easy on the nose, with milk chocolate and raspberry aromas. The palate is juicy, tight and well balanced, with lightly roasted plum fruit, spice and mild barrel notes. Dry, spicy and honest on the finish.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"This blowsy wine is waxy on the bouquet, with aromas of nectarine, pineapple and vanilla. It sports a chunky mouthfeel and tropical flavors, primarily pineapple accented by vanilla. On the finish, things fall off to stalky.",Sémillon
Argentina,"Here's a basic Malbec with ripe plum aromas topped off by milk chocolate and vanilla notes. It's hard but bold in the mouth, with decent acidity and a forced set of oaky, chocolaty, berry flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is true Cabernet evidenced by its mildly herbal nose of juniper, pine and leather that's mixed into a core of berry and cassis. The mouthfeel deals both jammy richness and crisp acidity, while flavors run from herb to black fruit to coffee.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Chunky plum, berry and toasty campfire aromas are full and thick on this blend of 60% Malbec and 40% Merlot. The palate is stout and meaty, with pronounced but honest tannins. It tastes charred, with ripe berry, prune and chocolate undercurrents. Loses some of its spunk on the finish.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Blueberry and cassis aromas are jammy and suggest graham crackers. This feels tight and narrow, with strict tannins. As for flavors, look for baked berry, herb and earth notes the finish shows berry,  leather and carob notes.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Aromas of matchstick, tropical fruits and stalkiness are a bit challenging. In the mouth, things feel solid and fresh, while flavors of sweet pear, melon, vanilla and apricot settle on mildly bitter come finishing time.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Rubbery aromas vie with solid berry fruit notes. The palate is basic and a touch edgy in feel, with red plum, currant and herbal flavors. Peppery and minty on the finish, but juicy and correct overall.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Despite being heavy and flat, this is an easygoing wine with raisiny notes on the nose and earthy, loamy berry and raisin flavors. The finish is soft, with nothing jagged or hard to deal with.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah
Argentina,"Barrel grain and spiced apple are the key aromas. This is round, chunky and not showing a lot of structure or backbone. Oaky flavors of butterscotch and baked apple end with a note of caramel.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"This Malbec-Cabernet blend hits the spot aromatically, delivering rock-solid black fruit and toasty oak scents. It feels rich, with chewy tannins and rooty-tasting berry and chocolate flavors. Smooth and easygoing, perhaps a touch soft on the finish. Drink now–2014.",Red Blend
Argentina,"The bouquet on this blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir is stuck in neutral, while flavors of citrus and lemon bend towards sour. The finish is briny and tangy.",White Blend
Argentina,"Mild lemon and apple aromas are compromised by a harsh, stalky element. The mouthfeel is basic and spritzy, while generic apple and green melon flavors end in tropical sweetness.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"This Chardonnay is slightly metallic and briny on the bouquet. It feels plump and chunky, with citrus and pineapple flavors coming in front of a quiet finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Following up on a bouquet that's lightly herbal and lactic, the palate feels hard and tannic, with oak-based resin sticking out. Flavors of black pepper, licorice and oak push away the wine's black-fruit component, leaving a minty finish that's oak-dominant and mildly artificial tasting.",Malbec
Argentina,"This Grigio opens with mild lemon and apple aromas that transition into a flabby palate and dull flavors of buttercup, banana and apple.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"This is light on the nose, where minerally lime scents are barely detectable. The mouthfeel is fresh but dilute, while flavors of lemon, green apple and tarragon end in simple fashion.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Light lemon and melon aromas lead the nose, but the wine slips in the mouth, becoming creamy and flabby in constitution, with only mild citrus, papaya and bitterness for flavors.",Viognier
Argentina,"This wine is rather stalky and pickled. The nose deals burning haystack, while the palate is mildly drawing and astringent, with stalky, briny tasting red berry flavors. It's briny on the finish as well.",Rosé
Argentina,"Opens with clean, standard tropical fruit aromas. The palate follows suit with a tight mouthfeel and tropical flavors of melon, baNAa and peach, all accented by a spot of vanilla. Mildly pithy and toasty on the finish. Good Argentine Chardonnay for the price.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Solid berry fruit aromas greet you, then turn a bit herbal and strained with airing. The palate has a healthy feel and reasonably good flavors of baked berry, herbs and mint. Blackberry notes carry the finish along with herbs, caramel and choppy tannins.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Clean, citric and precise on the nose, then exceedingly lean and pointy in the mouth, where uncompromised flavors of mineral, lime and orange peel set up a chalky, crisp finish. Mouthwatering and cleansing.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Rubber, herbal notes, grassy scents and leather comprise the bouquet. This feels wiry but solid, with cherry and berry flavors that finish with raisin and blackberry. As a whole, this is fruity and pleasant.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This is cloudy to the eye, with a mix of vinegar, briny plum and milk chocolate on the nose. The mouthfeel is blowsy, while the flavors are briny and pickled.",Rosé
Argentina,"Overall this is a weak wine with resiny aromas of varnish followed by woody flavors of banana and vanilla. The finish is more or less the same, only less potent.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"The nose is minty, herbal and strangely exotic, while the palate falls flat in delivering strongly herbal, tomato-based flavors.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Tropical fruit aromas are the lead-in, but upon airing the wine's pineapple and mango scents turn austere and prickly. The mouthfeel here is astringent and acidic, and the flavors are briny, even pickled.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Juniper and onion aromas are not inviting, and there's little fruit to back them up. The mouthfeel is oily, while flavors of briny citrus lead to a pickled-tasting finish. Tasted twice, with consistent results.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"The nose deals a mix of exotic aromas along with offputting sweat, compost and funky cheese. The palate is pasty feeling and tannic, with lactic flavors of oak, licorice and medicinal berry. On the finish, clove and spice notes dominate.",Merlot
Argentina,"Brushy and brambly smelling at first, then cleaner and fruitier as it breathes. Full and juicy in the mouth, with lightly toasted berry and plum flavors that register as regular but fresh. Long and linear on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Baked fruit and coconut are the lead aromas, and there's cassis and stewed berry scents as well. Gritty in the mouth, with sweet, medicinal berry fruit flavors, coconut and chocolate. Stocky, ripe, tannic and medicinal on the finish.",Cabernet Franc
Argentina,"Jammy on the nose, with a citrusy element, green notes and something muddy. For a big Malbec with a full price tag, it leaves me wondering: It's chunky and tastes of red berry, citrus, pineapple and marshmallow. Jumbled and sweet on the finish. Has enough good in it not to tank but it's not in full harmony.",Malbec
Argentina,"Popcorn is the overriding characteristic on this oaky Chardonnay. On the nose, it's movie popcorn with toast and baked apple. In the mouth, it's more popcorn along with buttered toast, salt and baked white-fruit flavors. And on the finish, there's woody flavors, toast and you guessed it, more popcorn.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"There's no denying the fact that this smells stalky and burnt, with leathery fruit aromas. In the mouth, it's choppy, with scratchy acidity leading to a loud flavor profile with stalky berry, raisin and stewed flavors. Heat and additional roasted notes drive the finish on this Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"With acrid matchstick aromas and little else, this wine gets off to a rough start and never finds solid footing. The palate is chunky and grabby, while the flavors are burnt and stalky, with bitterness to the finish.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Stalky, waxy aromas get this subpar varietal white going in the wrong direction. In the mouth, it's mushy, with creamy, briny, almost bitter flavors.",Sémillon
Argentina,"The quality of Casarena's wines range from excellent to not great, with all points in between represented. This Malbec-led blend is heavy and raisiny on the nose, then syrupy in the mouth, with flavors running straight to candied and flat.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Smells barbecued and saucy, with dry oak, resin and smoked meat aromas. The palate is more acidic, while the flavors lean toward resiny and saucy, i.e. hickory and roasted berry. Oaky on the finish, with sawdust and vanilla flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"Minty, floral aromas veer toward darker notes of cola, forest floor and leather. The palate is medium-full, with grabby tannins and roasted flavors of blackberry mixed with herbs and spice. A regular, oaky style of Cabernet with a raw, grabby mouthfeel.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Opens with aromas of mint and latex, then the oak rises up, leaving vanilla and sawdust scents. Dry tannins and good size set up a minty-tasting flavor profile with resin and wild berry flavors. Finishes with anise and licorice, and just enough acidity to keep it balanced.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark in the glass, this has a moderately complex nose, with notes of black fruit, leather and spice. It feels tight, fresh and snappy, but not excessively wide or structured. Flavors of ripe berry and cocoa lead to a solid finish, which has a controlled, smooth feel. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Merlot.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Dry, dusty cassis aromas are full and friendly, with added notes of earth and graphite. The mouthfeel is round, full and fresh, with tight acids and dry, woody, spicy flavors of black fruit that are accented by vanilla and butter. It finishes toasty and lengthy, with a comfortable fade. Only 350 cases were made.",Malbec
Argentina,"Hard, rubbery black-fruit aromas end with a whiff of cherry-cola. This feels zesty and fresh, with a medium body and snappy acids. Short, choppy flavors of red plum and cherry finish quick, with a salty note.",Merlot
Argentina,"DiamAndes continues to put out clunky Viogniers from the Uco Valley. This is bland and waxy on the nose, with notes of green melon and nectarine. The palate is round and full but lacks personality, while flavors of papaya and melon are heavy and finish yeasty.",Viognier
Argentina,"Very red and slightly grassy on the nose, with aromas of strawberry, mint leaf and rhubarb. It's a juicy screamer in the mouth, with intensity, blazing acidity and wild raspberry and plum flavors. Dry, tight and long on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"The name and packaging scream “concept wine,” but what's in the bottle will win you over. It's full and rubbery, with pleasant yet generic berry aromas. The palate is racy and fairly hefty and tannic, with black raspberry, plum and mild herbal flavors. Grabby, with good acidity on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A big drop off from prior years, probably due to the cold harvest conditions of 2008. Smells minty and lactic, with hard spice and distant fruit aromas. Feels closed, tannic and clipped, with narrow berry flavors and green notes. Toasty on the finish, but also clacky feeling. Good relative to other wines, but not at $70.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rubbery, bold and earthy on the nose, then full and sticky in the mouth, with sweet black fruit flavors. Tastes more like a Bordeaux red wine than textbook Pinot Noir courtesy of heavy extraction, darkness and oak. Tastes good but could use a lesson in elegance and restraint.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Stemmy top aromas cover up earthy berry notes. This is grabby in the mouth with an acid-tannin package that sits on the hard side. Herbal red-berry flavors come with minty green notes and a stalky finish. This is 70% Malbec and 30% Corvina, an Italian variety from the Veneto.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Sweet aromas of sugar cookie come with a pinch of citrus fruit. The mouth is plump, with just enough citric acidity to keep it together. Flavors of pineapple, lemon, tangerine and grapefruit peel lead to a pithy, slightly bitter finish. Drink immediately; it's starting to fade.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"In good vintages like 2011, Trapiche's Malbecs can be impressive across the board, as evidenced by this value. The nose is fresh and fruity, with a dusting of cocoa. It feels layered and vibrant, with ripe berry, toast and spice flavors. Smooth and easy on the fade.",Malbec
Argentina,"Roasted and decidedly earthy on the nose, this has mature aromas of coffee, spice and herb note. A solid fabric of aged tannins and acidity bolster the wild berry and cherry flavors, which finish syrupy and raisiny. A blend of 50% Petit Verdot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Malbec.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Crisp, lightly herbal raspberry aromas are a touch reedy and green. This feels chewy and saturated, while herbal, candied, slightly syrupy flavors of sweet berries finish minty and hot.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This is exceedingly ripe tasting, with a syrupy texture. Along the way, you'll encounter tar and rubber aromas in front of flavors such as carob, vanilla and stewed berry fruits. A minty, oaky finish is the final weighty act.",Malbec
Argentina,"Berry, cola, pepper and lemon peel aromas are taken down a notch by a note of spent coffee grinds. The palate is grabby, with creamy flavors of chocolate, vanilla, berry and milkshake. Finishes thick and sweet.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tropical and a bit briney on the nose. The palate is healthy in feel, with sweet white fruit flavors, a pinch of lemon and creamy oak. Finishes quick, with a nice feel and adequate acidity; will do best if well chilled.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Neutral smelling except for a bit of lime, grass and mineral. Feels juicy and citric in the mouth, with pithy flavors of lime, orange and green grass. Finishes slightly bitter and pithy, but fresh and tangy.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Grassy red berry and plum aromas lead to a lean, somewhat high-acid palate with herbal, oaky flavors of raspberry and plum that don't last that long. Fresh and healthy feeling on the finish, but tasting more of oak and spice than fruit.",Malbec
Argentina,"This big, oaky specimen opens with aromas of cheesy berry, vanilla, spice and heat on the bouquet. It feels tannic, full bodied and resiny, with tastes of wood, dried cheese, vanilla and roasted berry. The finish shows residual oak, hickory and soupy berry leftovers. A bomber that's fully oaked, almost to the point of being overdone. A blend of 66% Malbec, 20% Cabernet and 14% Tempranillo.",Red Blend
Argentina,"This is big and yellowish in color, which is usually an indicator of strong barrel character. And indeed, it's very oaky and resiny on the nose, palate and finish. But in between the waves of wood spice, vanilla and resin are complexities, fine acidity, good textural balance and sweet, tropical fruit flavors. Drink now.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Eolo is apparently on the upswing in just its 3rd incarnation. The nose is deep and sweet, with licorice, rubber, lemon peel and tobacco to go with bold berry aromas. Shows immensity and structure in the mouth, with layered blackberry flavors and creaminess. Fades well, with tobacco and leather gracing the finish. Drink now through 2014.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rich, pure and inviting as can be, with coconut, cola, licorice and a ton of black fruit making for an excellent bouquet. The palate is rich and smooth in texture, with blackberry, cassis and cola flavors. Layered and pure on the finish, with exemplary depth and length.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dense blackberry fruit reigns supreme on the nose, with smoke and dark, earthy notes lying in wait. The palate has a firm tightness and oaky black-fruit flavors that offer a twinge of coconut and herbs. Toasty and chocolaty on the finish. A big, stacked Malbec to drink now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"A well-made everyday Malbec that gets it done in all ways. Smells nice and floral, with bold, smooth berry aromas. The palate is fresh and lively, with juicy berry flavors, controlled creamy oak notes and spice. Clean on the finish, and a pleasure to drink.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with candied, chocolaty aromas that contradict its age. In the mouth, it's mature although the structure is breaking up; nonetheless, it's interesting and attractive, with herb, raspberry, tea, tobacco and chocolate flavors. Overall it's a different breed, and despite having lost its structure it's sly and well worth a go. Drink now.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A nice, clean, fairly complex white is what this is. The nose is all lychee and jasmine, and it's not at all heavy or oily. The palate is bouncy and fresh, with a tropical mix of lychee, melon and papaya flavors. Agile on the finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Graham cracker is the lead aroma, and that's followed by jammy fruit, cookie dough and finally a touch of raisin. The palate is plump for an '08, with berry flavors, herbal notes and some bitterness. A touch clipped and rough, but a good effort for a tough year.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is a solid, well-crafted and flavorful Malbec. Black fruit and cocoa aromas set up a concentrated palate, bearing chewy, dense flavors of black plum, wild berry and chocolate, plus toast and pepper notes. Production is 100,000-plus cases.",Malbec
Argentina,"Over the years, Altimus—a blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Tannat—has been all over the map. This vintage is quite good, with burly aromas of bacon, balsam wood, campfire and black fruit. It's a load in the mouth, where minty, lemony oak flavors vie with blackberry and foresty herb notes. Leather and tobacco flavors appear on the feisty finish.",Red Blend
Argentina,"This is a powerfully built Malbec with intense aromas of mint, medicine and blackberry. It feels thick and pure, with a chewy texture and medicinal flavors of berry, vanilla and spice. The flavors veer toward char, pepper and darkness on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Good but not excessively expressive on the bouquet, this reveals a milk chocolate element that emerges after the wine airs. The flavor profile starts with a lemony oak note, with notes of blackberry, herb and peppery spice underneath. The nice finish is modest, like the bouquet. Only 300 cases made.",Malbec
Argentina,"Oaky up front, with more than a dash of mocha, caramel and sweet berry fruit aromas. The palate is zesty and honest, with juicy, bright black cherry and berry flavors. Finishes toasty and perky, with one last shot of firm acidity to keep it running long and late.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens like a luxury-level Malbec should; it's dark and dense, with black cherry, smoke and rubbery aromas. The palate is deep and juicy, with bold, attractive black fruit, plum, tobacco and vanilla flavors. Smooth, healthy and drinkable now.",Malbec
Argentina,"Intense stuff, with foresty, forceful aromas of blackberry, black cherry, char, mineral and toast. The palate is quite thick and dense, with baked and spicy blackberry flavors offset by herbal notes. Concentrated and minty, with a bullish finish.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Round, lifted and bright, with full berry, cassis and plum aromas. The palate is round and the body full, while the flavor profile includes roasted blackberry, coffee, chocolate and coconut. A full and chewy wine that comes across nice given the troubles of the '08 vintage.",Malbec
Argentina,"A pretty white wine with lively aromas, flavors and feel. The bouquet issues attractive lychee, melon and vanilla cream aromas, while the palate flows forth with apple, melon and exotic citrus flavors. Just spicy enough on the tail end, with a lasting taste of lychee fruit. Delicate, solid and fresh.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Blackberry, rubber and a suggestion of minerality work well as an invitation to this juicy, woody wine that's long and full in the mouth, with dark-fruit flavors of black cherry, blackberry and plum. Woody and toasty, too, but dry and spicy rather than sweet, blowsy and creamy. A nice Malbec for all occasions.",Malbec
Argentina,"Minty, oaky and spicy up front, with cherry and berry aromas that are potent. The palate is lush, flush and tannic, with aggressive flavors of bacon, smoke, roasted blackberry and savory spices. It finishes well, with freshness along with a dark, smoky tail.",Syrah
Argentina,"Dense and beefy at first, then menthol, licorice, blackberry and earth aromas come out on the nose. The palate is deep and well structured, with toasty, dark flavors of chocolate mint along with leathery berry. Finishes with coffee and peppery flavors. Serious and satisfying; 60% Malbec and 40% Cab Sauvignon.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A little charred and hard on the nose, with licorice, pepper, mint and coffee aromas. The palate is perfectly balanced and quite generous, with massive blackberry and chocolate flavors. Spicy and long on the finish, with mocha notes. Definitely a ripe, big-boned wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big, woody and pure, with attractive plum and berry aromas that bring earth and toast. The mouth is alert and features textured tannins, while the flavor profile is a bit rooty and sweet, with roasted black fruit and spice. Grabby, warm and stout on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"A winning Malbec for under $20. The nose is pure and hits with a blast of licorice, tobacco, cola, blackberry and dry balsam wood. The palate is driving, with blackberry, black plum and pepper flavors. Potent but balanced on the way out. Drink now and over the next couple of years.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smooth berry and chocolate aromas control the nose on this Cabernet-Syrah blend. On the palate, it's lush and full, with a streak of citrusy acidity. Flavors of plum and berry come with chocolate and vanilla accents. Regular on the finish in terms of length, power and complexity.",Cabernet-Syrah
Argentina,"This wine requires breathing time to show its true colors. Early on it's reduced and cheesy, but soon it offers cleaner aromas of cola, berry and dark plum. The acidity is a bit high and sheering, but on the plus side it's fresh and driving, with bright cherry and berry flavors along with ample oak.",Malbec
Argentina,"Floral and fruity to open the show, and then there's plenty of oak and resin aromas coming next. The palate is tight, acid rich and woody, with solid black fruit flavors along with toasted oak notes and coconut. Juicy, fresh and healthy, but quite oaky.",Malbec
Argentina,"Starts out earthy and gaseous but the bouquet settles on round, full blackberry aromas. Lush, grabby and full in the mouth, with bold blackberry flavors that are clean, forward, uncomplicated and even a bit elegant. Tastes good and comes across smooth and polished for Bonarda.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Sound and full on the nose, this features plum and berry aromas. This is a full-bodied, round Malbec that's neither overextracted nor excessively heavy. The flavors of baked berry, chocolate and herb are nice, as is the spicy finish of mint and tobacco.",Malbec
Argentina,"Huge as a grizzly bear, with grilled meat, dried herbs and oregano on the nose. The palate is really big, with astringent tannins and large flavors of toast, blackberry, spice and caramel. Finishes sweet, with burnt brown sugar and drying tannins. A four-grape wine led by Cabernet Sauvignon.",Meritage
Argentina,"Spicy, concentrated aromas of leather, berry fruit and dried cheddar cheese lead to a lush, balanced palate with heft, acidity and tasty flavors of chocolate, coffee and spiced blackberry. Full, long and flavorful on the finish. A big Malbec but one that's well balanced.",Malbec
Argentina,"A rich Malbec with graham cracker, pastry, blackberrry and boysenberry aromas. Talk about super concentrated; this is thick but balanced, with tannic grip and dark, baked flavors of berry and chocolate. Bulky on the finish, with peppery spice, vanilla and a touch of heat.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is gorgeous on the bouquet, with earth, flower blossom, licorice and sandalwood aromas. It feels lush and layered, with ripe, happy flavors of sultry black fruit and cassis. Fruity, long and delicious on the finish, this is a very easy Malbec to dig into now and until 2015.",Malbec
Argentina,"Light, airy, tropical and very nice for an under-$10 Argentine Chardonnay. The nose is nice and easy, while the flavors of orange, melon and lychee are tropical but seem right for the wine's body and acidity. Easygoing as they come, with a hint of sweetness on the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Initially it smells flat and earthy, with raisiny black fruit aromas. As it airs out it improves, but throughout its run it comes across heavy and wayward, with raisiny flavors and a simple dullness that prevents the wine from rising to the next level. Good Malbec but not a value at $45.",Malbec
Argentina,"By all accounts, 2008 was a tough vintage with cool weather, stunting frosts and ripeness issues. This wine seems afflicted: its opening is good, with coconut and floral shadings. But the palate is limited in richness and the flavors are standard, with char and barrel notes creating bitterness. Nice and honest for a subpar year.",Malbec
Argentina,"This wine is smoky, with leather, berry and barbecue aromas that lurk below a veneer of oak. It has a good mouthfeel, with berry, plum and oak flavors. It finishes bold, with a scratchy feel and loads of leftover barrel spice. A blend of 85% Malbec, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Syrah.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Ripe blackberry aromas are accented by herbal notes, tomato, cedar and tobacco. The palate is full and walled in by big tannins, while the flavor profile is ripe, masculine and centered on black fruit, mocha and coffee. Toasty and oaky late, with tobacco on the finish. A serious wine with obvious qualities.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Tight and deep, with leather, dried cheese and full berry aromas. The palate is jammy and lush in feel, with roasted, mile-deep berry and licorice flavors. A fine Malbec that's easy to drink and black in style; the finish runs long and solid as berry fruit and toasty oak hold court. Drink now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"Having tasted the previous vintages and not liking them all that much, I can safely say that this 2010 is a much better, cleaner, more varietally correct version of Torrontés. It's clean, fresh and defined by light aromas and flavors of lime and green melon. Juicy and soda-like on the finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Sweet and savory aromas of hickory, BBQ and plum jam are nice, while the body is structured and full. The flavors follow the nose, meaning there's a savory, roasted quality to the wine but also jammy raspberry fruit notes. Chewy and a bit marinated, but it's quite good for the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sweet and candied on the nose, with marshmallow, cotton candy, chocolate-dipped cherry and dustiness. The palate has a pure feel and good ripeness, with flavors of herbal berry, toast, coffee and spice. Warm, chocolaty and oaky, with a lasting mocha flavor.",Malbec
Argentina,"Bold and pruney, with herbal, soft, ultraripe aromas in front of a jumpy yet partially stewed palate. This blend of Malbec with Bonarda and Syrah is your typical huge, tannic bruiser with big extract, huge tannins and just enough acidity to keep it pumping. Pretty good and perfectly drinkable, but a little over the edge.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Despite showing a grassy component on the bouquet, this is a sturdy, generous Malbec with a mix of dark, juicy aromas and flavors. Touches of blackberry and dark plum carry an herb streak, while the finish is minty, toasted and chunky, with a final volley of menthol and herb notes.",Malbec
Argentina,"Berry fruit aromas blend nicely with cola, forest, toast and barrel aromas. It's crisp yet deep in the mouth, with smacking tannins and just enough cushion to soften things up. Minty and woody tasting, with berry, tobacco and peppery flavors on the palate and finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Earthy and deep from head to tail. The nose offers fresh compost, loamy berry, cola and overriding richness. Feels smooth and layered across the palate, with dark berry, pepper and bitter chocolate flavors. Blackened on the finish and toasty; 50% Malbec with four additional Bordeaux varieties.",Red Blend
Argentina,"This staunch Malbec opens with straightforward berry aromas, and with airing it turns leathery and cheesy smelling. It's tight and tannic on the palate, with lemony oak, potent blackberry and herb flavors. Short, rugged and tannic on the finish, but loaded with flavor and spunk.",Malbec
Argentina,"Gritty in scent up front, this features beet and candied black-fruit aromas along with a dry spice note. It feels chunky, with powerful tannins. Flavors of black plum, berry, coffee and chocolate finish with a sweet vanilla taste and another helping of ripe black fruit.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Scratchy berry and cherry aromas are a bit fiery, leading to the palate that feels raw on the edges but more dense and syrupy in the middle. Big, chunky and generous, this has flavors of creamy berry and pepper lead to a hot, full, somewhat syrupy finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Black cherry and wild berry aromas are tight and don't stray much from center stage. The palate is layered, fresh and spunky, with flavors that match the bouquet in that cherry, wild berry and plum run the show. Toasty and chocolaty on the finish, with a rock-solid feel and bright fruit flavors that don't quit.",Bonarda
Argentina,"The nose is deep and dense, delivering pure blackberry and blueberry aromas along with toast and herb notes. It feels balanced and pure as a cloudless night, with controlled blackberry, spice and chocolate flavors. Strong on the finish, with bitter notes of chocolate and espresso, and narrow tannins.",Malbec
Argentina,"As the higher-end 2008s hit the market, the vintage's underwhelming character is confirmed via wines like this. Oaky and rubbery on the nose, with scattered, lean berry fruit flavors and bitterness. Like many '08s, it's short on richness and comes across unfocused. That said, it's still a good wine that's not badly made.",Malbec
Argentina,"Given the difficulties of 2008, this is a commendable, drinkable wine. The nose is full and dark, with ripe berry aromas. That leads to a tannic, semisharp palate with spunky blackberry fruit that comes with spice and chocolate shadings. Flavorful and correct, but a little tight and tough.",Malbec
Argentina,"Clean and tropical, and not too heavy, oily or chunky. The nose is pure lemon, pear and apple, while the flavor profile revolves around citrus, apple and honey in the center. Finishes sweeter than it starts, but with dry papaya for balance. Good everyday Chardonnay from Argentina, something we don't see too often.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Earthy and warm on first take, with deep fruit and soupy side aromas. The palate is juicy and lively, with blackberry flavors as well as toasty accents. Round, ripe and generous on the finish, with brightness but also a syrupy side. All in all it's a good wine for the money.",Malbec
Argentina,"A touch creamy and showing fresh corn and haystack on the nose, but in the mouth it's plump, good and mild, with fleshy white fruit flavors sitting in front of a smooth, lightly pithy finish. Yes, it's another warm-climate tropical Chardonnay. But it's a good one that's easy to drink.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Cadus starts with big aromas of berry, cola and cool earth, but it drops off on the palate. By the time it finishes, the wine has lost steam and seems a little flat. Along the way, it's plump and easy, with mossy, earthy flavors of herbs and black fruits. Could be fresher.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lemon, pine and bath oil aromas are more dense and serious than what's normal for this variety, while the palate has richness, weight and an oily texture. Flavors of melon, baked apple and toffee are rich and a bit oxidized, while butterscotch and musky fruit flavors work the finish. Drink now.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Red berry aromas with spice and licorice shadings make for a good opening. The wine smacks down hard on the palate, creating a clacky feel to go with plum, berry, herb and spice flavors. Serious and full, with juiciness, grabby tannins and a toasty coffee-laden finish. Malbec, Syrah and Merlot.",Red Blend
Argentina,"An exotic style of Malbec with Middle Eastern spice, violet, anise and berry aromas. The palate has hammering tannins but enough body to absorb it, leaving herbal black fruit, fig and peppery flavors. Warm and toasty on the finish, with savory notes that last for a good long while.",Malbec
Argentina,"Nicely staged aromas of berry, plum, coconut and vanilla set up a driving, full-force palate that's lemony in feel and offers potent flavors of raspberry, plum, herbs and oak. Dry, woody and a touch fiery, with power to spare. Just 250 cases made.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Roasted at first, with coffee, grilled meat and earth aromas taking the lead. Narrow in the mouth, with firm tannins that frame ripe and healthy raspberry flavors accented by vanilla and cola. A little bit traditional in that it's earthy and dry, but it's not devoid of fruit and attitude.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Black plum, blackberry, lemon zest and licorice are the key aromas on this Amarone-patterned blend from Argentina. The palate is concentrated, rich and lush, with grabby, soft tannins and sweet flavors of blackberry, brown sugar and caramel. Toasty and mild on the finish, with jammy thickness.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Floral and attractive on the bouquet, with citrus peel, light raspberry, cassis and lift. The palate runs tannic and fresh, with crisp black cherry and kirsch flavors that flow seamlessly into layered tobacco and mild herbal notes. A sophisticated red made from Malbec, Cabernet and Bonarda.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Heavily charred and roasted throughout, with a blackened nose. The palate is broad and chewy, with thick tannins and roasted, ripe flavors of blackberry, licorice and bitter chocolate. Remains severely toasted all the way to the final drop; aged in 80% new French oak (apparently fully toasted oak).",Malbec
Argentina,"This is tight and sturdy as a rock up front, with licorice, hard spice, leather and black cherry aromas. It feels round, chewy, tough and healthy, with flavors of baked black fruit, chocolate, molasses and hickory. Roasted and oaky, but cool and collected. Drink now through 2016.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Concentrated, dark and clean for a basic 2008 Cabernet, with full but generic berry aromas and a pinch of rubber. The body is good and so is the structure, and overall the wine's roasted berry flavors blend well with sweet vanilla and caramel. Very good for value-priced Argentine CS.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Heavy blackberry, bacon, rubber and spice aromas set up a voluminous palate, with grabby tannins and deep flavors of baked blackberry, clove and chocolate. The finish feels thick, powerful and long, with a chocolate accent.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Cherry, cassis and spice aromas are mild and comported. The wine feels chewy and just dense enough, with baked cassis, berry and herb flavors that finish toasty and hot, with a rubbery note. Clean aromas and full fruit flavors are this wine's best attributes.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A full-force Malbec with classy black fruit, rubber, cassis and balsamic aromas. The palate sports a nice mouthfeel, fine balance and tasty flavors of herbs, blackberry, roasted plum and chocolate. Elegant but strong, with layering and a lot of qualities for a $20 wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Stout and a little baked up front, with heavy berry and slightly stewy aromas. Chewy and meaty on the palate, with plum, berry, leather and herbal flavors that marry well and show complexity. Fine structure and tightness suggest this Malbec-led blend could age for a while longer; drink now through 2014.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Smoky, dark, rich and very oaky, with leather and cheese aromas. This is one concentrated, tannic bruiser; it's fully extracted and roasted, with blackberry, molasses, pepper and coffee flavors. A lush, round, jammy specimen that pours on richness in place of elegance and sophistication.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Warm and generous on the nose, with hints of brick dust and herbal strawberry fruit. Seems healthy and ready in the mouth, with good berry fruit, moderate spice notes and just a minor touch of herbal character. Works well, although it worked better when it was an under-$10 wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Minty and heavily oaked, with creamy aromas of vanilla bean, milk chocolate and raisiny sweetness. The palate smacks down with a tight, rubbery feel and then unleashes heavy, toasty flavors of herbal berry fruit, raw oak and mocha. Good for a rich, robust wine but it doesn't excel and it seems a little out of balance.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Spice, mint, herb, raspberry and currant aromas form a good nose. Things run a bit choppy and rough on the palate, but overall it works, bearing roasted berry and herb influences, with grabby tannins. This is a full, stocky, spicy and mildly green-leaning Cabernet.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Punchy black-cherry and herb aromas form a clean, honest greeting. The wine feels good and plump, with a solid structure and familiar flavors of blackberry, vanilla and toasted spice. Turns minty and a little fiery on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"This wine is herbal, prickly and roasted, singing the Salta tune of oddness and earthiness. It feels medium to full in the mouth, with a roasted dark-berry flavor and plenty of herb and pimiento tones. Finishes deep but salty, with notes of roasted red pepper and stew. A blend of 80% Malbec and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Attractive berry and dried fig aromas are rich and healthy. The pretty bouquet is backed by bright, juicy blackberry flavors that come with a spicy backing. Lightly toasted and smooth on the finish; overall this is uncomplicated Malbec that hits the spot.",Malbec
Argentina,"A savory bouquet includes aromas of chocolate, smoke, blackberry and earthy plum. The palate shows grip and a syrupy density, while the flavors run towards candied black fruits, leather and savory spice. Very ripe and a bit soft and sweet. Drink now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"Layered aromas of cassis, berry, coffee and mocha come with regional Cafayate green notes. The palate is lively and offers ribald acidity along with red plum, berry, vanilla, spice and toast flavors. Turns more oaky the longer it's open, with vanilla and dill on the finish.",Malbec-Merlot
Argentina,"Smoky, rich and savory to start out, with compact berry and plum aromas that slant towards raisin with airing. The palate is warm, full and offers good structure; flavors of baked plum and berry are nice and the finish is savory and firm, with tannic framing.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Opens with a slight chemical-smelling topping to berry, raisin and cheesy aromas. The palate is chunky on one hand and driving on the other, with berry and raisiny flavors. Lush on the finish but raisiny, and overall it settles on soft-bodied and flush.",Malbec
Argentina,"This extracted, full-bodied Malbec opens with smashed berry, prune and minty oak aromas. It's thick but limited on the palate, with beefy tannins but not a lot of depth. It tastes like blackberry and fudge—more big and burly than complex.",Malbec
Argentina,"Norton Reserva is one of Argentina's best Cabernetss for the money. This vintage offers a mineral aroma along with rose petal, baked plum and spiced cherry scents. It feels deep, generous and balanced, with cassis, blackberry, earth and molasses flavors.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Big and purple, with ripe aromas of black fruits and bacon. The mouth is filling and full, with oaky blackberry, coffee and mildly roasted flavors. Turns more lush and soft on the finish, which is long and tastes of fig paste and prunes. Gets it done for the most part.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Pungent aromas of citrus range from lemon to orange, and there's also an oily element to the bouquet. The palate has a highly regular, almost lazy feel to it along with flavors of pithy citrus and nectarine pit. Finishes lemony and melony.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Opens with standard cherry/berry aromas, although with airing cheese notes and dill enter the picture. The palate is meaty in feel, with firm, tough, slightly roasted plum and berry flavors. Finishes hot, with a bold plum and berry character.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tropical and typical for the variety, with lychee and oily match stick on the nose. The palate is competent, with lemon-lime, apple and spiced Asian pear flavors. Dries out nicely on the finish; good Torrontés to drink as soon as possible.",Torrontés
Argentina,"The nose is toasty and properly oaked, with mineral and apple aromas. It's a touch resiny in feel, while flavors of honeyed apple and cinnamon lead to a finish that shows notes of vanilla, toasted hazelnut and wood-spice flavors. Oaky for sure, and ready to drink.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Somewhat rustic on the nose, with baked, herbal lead aromas bringing side scents of tree bark and earthy berry. Tightly wound and tannic in the mouth, with cola, spice and chocolaty flavors. Dry, focused and composed as it makes its point.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Black fruit, licorice, cola and chocolate aromas cover the bases. The palate is full, sweet and saturated, with a slight syrupy feel and bold blackberry, blueberry and mocha flavors. Sweet on the finish, with vanilla, coffee and a small wash of herbal green; 60% Bonarda/40% Malbec.",Malbec-Bonarda
Argentina,"Sweet and leafy smelling, with a hint of green bean to go with root beer and berry aromas. The palate is tannic and tight, with an untamed overall mouthfeel. Tastes lively and zesty, with blackberry, plum and chocolate flavors. Toasty and firm on the finish. Malbec, CS, Merlot and Syrah in descending order.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Composed up front, with floral aromas matching wits with dry herb notes and solid berry fruit scents. The palate is snappy and crisp, with focus and narrow, tight flavors of raspberry and plum blended with vanilla. Bright and juicy throughout, with vanilla and toast on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Waxy and warm, with peach, sweet ham, spice and vanilla aromas. As Catena Alta goes, this is not stellar. In fact, it's light on fruit and lacks the depth of flavor and punch you'd hope to see from a $34 wine. What you get is a fleshy, soft Chard with mild peach, papaya and melon flavors, and then a whack of finishing oak.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Firm and leathery smelling, with a drying, oaky nose and then lifted, sweet flavors of jammy raspberry and cassis. The fruit here is riper than many '08 Cabs, and while it's a bit lean in feel, it tastes good and offers ample spice for balance.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Simple, well made and tropical, with a touch of oak. The palate is zesty, citric and healthy, with pineapple and orange flavors along with a pinch of star anise, vanillin and pith. Finishes fresh and juicy, with mild vanilla shadings.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Rubbery, tarry and quite black in nature, with a full-bodied mouthfeel and meaty, spicy dark-berry flavors. This ranks as a voluminous wine with a heavy disposition; it's sweet and spicy late, with generic bold-fruit character throughout.",Syrah
Argentina,"Modest, minerally and clean, with mild dusty apple aromas. The palate is pillowy and comfortable, with just enough acidity to push up the apple, green grape and white plum flavors. Finishes similarly, with a sweet lasting impression.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"This smells big but flat, with rich, jammy scents of berry and cherry. The palate comes across heavy and grabby. Flavors of pastry, lactic plum, berry and cassis are heavily influenced with oak, while the finish is full in feel but short in flavor. A blend of 62% Malbec, 26% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Syrah.",Red Blend
Argentina,"This smells rubbery and horsey at first, then earthy and ripe. It feels grabby and tannic, with rustic, leathery flavors of baked berry and cheese. Narrow and a bit dried out, this may already be past its prime in terms of vitality.",Malbec
Argentina,"An oily white-fruit aroma is overrun by a heavy oak scent, leaving notes of resin and toast on the bouquet. The wine feels fleshy, and the palate keeps that theme going with baked flavors of apple and peach. This is about as oaky as a wine can be and still be very good.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Attractive and not overpowering on the bouquet, with plum and red berry aromas mixing with smoky rubber and floral hints. The acidity, however, is piercing and racy, creating angularity on the palate along with red plum, raspberry, vanilla and coconut flavors. A fiery, pointy Malbec with very nice flavors and length.",Malbec
Argentina,"Floral berry aromas bring prune and tree bark as well. The palate is warm but not overextracted, while the flavors of red plum, dry herbs, berry and resiny vanilla turn lemony on the back end. Juicy, perky and herbal on the finish, with some heat.",Malbec
Argentina,"Gritty on the greeting, with char, plum, berry and juniper aromas. The palate is full-bodied, with nice raspberry, plum and spice flavors. Good and easy as it unfolds on the finish. Well-mannered and juicy, with a notch or two of complexity.",Malbec
Argentina,"Round, earthy and full, with leather, spice and several other good things floating about the nose. The palate has a crisp and zesty feel, with bright plum and berry flavors accented by spice, herb and a touch of buttery oak. Solid, tight and stylish for the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dense and solid from the start, with deep plum, wild berry and earth aromas. Ripe, whole and nice on the palate, with crusty blackberry, chocolate and spice flavors. Finishes lightly toasted, with comportment. Real good for everyday Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smoky but also sort of salinic on the nose, with pumped-up berry and black currant aromas. The palate is chewy and a bit heavy, with dark berry, cassis and peppery flavors. Heavy, sultry and black on the finish, with a lasting syrupy sweetness. Should be appealing to most Malbec fans.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dense black-fruit aromas have a coconut edge, and the entire nose turns mossy and leathery with airing. It feels dense, chewy and a little soft, with an earthy, reedy flavor of black fruit that's touched up with coffee. Plump, spicy and ever so slightly herbal on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Aromas of balsam wood, dry spice, berries and vanilla are attractive and inviting. It feels lush and deep, with good layering and robust flavors of berry fruit, spice, herb and tobacco. Flush and slightly herbal tasting on the back end, this is a complex, quality blend of Malbec, Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Warm and oaky on the nose, with sawdust, cassis, vanilla and lemon peel aromas. The palate is saturated and kind of dull in feel, with ripe blueberry, blackberry and spice flavors that are chunky and don't evolve on the back palate and finish. A rich Malbec-Cabernet-Merlot blend that registers low on pulse. Drink now.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Smoky, savory and fairly dense on the bouquet, with blackberry and a bit of earthy funk to it. Lush, jammy and chewy in the mouth, with baked blackberry, pepper, baking spice and other earthy flavors. Registers as a chunky, saturated and ripe wine with weight to spare.",Malbec
Argentina,"Solid and inviting up front, with licorice, menthol, floral berry and power. The palate is tight, firm, tannic and lemony, with oak-based vanilla, dill and lemon flavors accenting meaty but generic berry fruit. Snappy and tight on the finish, with plenty of acidity.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Toasty right from the start, with a good application of barrel aromas mixed with apple and butterscotch. The palate is both creamy and vital due to core acidity, while the flavors run tropical, sweet, citrusy and resiny. Keeps its zing on the finish, which tastes sweet and ripe.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Slightly grassy and jammy on the nose, but otherwise you get basic cherry and raspberry aromas. The palate is medium bodied and a bit sharp in feel, with fresh, simple cherry and raspberry flavors. Tight and straightforward on the finish, with a hint of spice and chocolate.",Merlot
Argentina,"Aromas of dark berry are potent but narrow and limited, and there's a slight note of minty grass as well. The wine is juicy, bouncy and fresh in the mouth, with dark cherry and blackberry flavors. Simple, fruity and tasty, with good balance.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Seems light, stemmy and minty on first take, but airing reveals deeper cola and sweet fruit aromas. The palate is juicy, not too heavy and strides forward, while the flavors center on basic red fruits and berry syrup. A little raisiny late, but solid as a whole.",Malbec
Argentina,"Quiet yet solid on the nose, with mild aromas of cassis and black fruits. The palate is a bit sharp with acidity but overall the wine is well made and clean, with red berry, plum and other standard flavors. Defines goodness while not pushing the envelope at all.",Malbec
Argentina,"Earthy and rubbery, then more leafy and red, on the nose, with raspberry and plum fruit. The palate has a solid, ordinary feel and jammy flavors of baked berry. Standard finish with a fast fade.",Merlot
Argentina,"Simple and light, with orange blossom aromas. The palate is clean, zesty and citric, with apple, lime and lychee flavors. Chalky on the finish and cleansing. For casual sipping.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Scratchy on the nose, with raspberry and plum aromas. The palate has a generic, rubbery feel and sweet, standard cherry, cassis and plum flavors. Medicinal and rubbery on the finish, but will go well with basic foods like pizza, spaghetti or a burger.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"High Note is a dark, extracted type of Malbec with intense color, robust black fruit aromas and a rich, deep palate with core acidity and then monstrous, sweet berry flavors along the edges. It's hefty, fat and saturated, but also sweet and jammy. Delivers quantity and volume for the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"Quite woody for this weight class, with balsam shavings and berry aromas that are distant. Chewy, lactic and creamy across the tongue, with a flavor profile that brings chocolate and berry syrup flavors. Finishes with a final wave of oaky spice and bitterness; good but needs more fruit.",Malbec
Argentina,"Scratchy berry aromas settle down with airing, revealing a medium-plus-sized palate, with good freshness and a dark fruit flavor, like black plum, along with fiery spice. It turns dry and peppery on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is herbal and clipped smelling, with a scattering of berry and plum notes. It feels saturated and chewy, with roasted berry, pepper and spice flavors that lead to a lightly herbal finish, with a rubbery accent and a baked fruit note.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Initially, there are plenty of hay, barnyard, horsehide and other old-style aromas. The palate feels chunky and a touch flat, with beet, root beer and molasses flavors. It finishes with flabby definition and ripe, sweet heat.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rubbery at first, then it rounds out and settles down to offer blackberry richness and jammy aromas. The palate is soft, lush and cushioned, while blackberry flavors run sweet, toasty and chocolaty. Remains sweet on the finish, with fig and minty spice flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rooty and smoky smelling, with hickory, roasted berry, cherry and red currant aromas. The palate is smartly structured, with cassis, plum and other solid berry flavors. Finishes with composure and length; a likable wine for grilled meats.",Cabernet Sauvignon

Argentina,"Woodsy aromas lead the charge, followed by mocha, smoke, raspberry and plum. There's good acidic lift to the palate and toasty, dark flavors of roasted berry, cassis and chocolate. Finishes lively and bright. Solid Cabernet for the money; a good wine to match with beef.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Starts out rubbery and gaseous, but airing helps it along. The palate is regular in feel, with no glaring faults, while the flavors of berry fruits, oak and herbal shadings are easygoing. Finishes with toast, herbal notes and a mild baked sweetness.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"Generic and generally clean, with dry berry aromas and a touch of sharpness. The palate is full, stocky and solid, with black-fruit flavors and a medicinal character. Finishes dry, woody, peppery and slightly hot, with snap and power.",Malbec
Argentina,"A touch grassy to start, with blueberry and blackberry aromas. The palate has a clampy, tannic feel and snappy acids, while the flavors veer toward red berry, herbs, coffee and mocha. Tight and tannic on the finish, and overall it's short on body.",Malbec
Argentina,"Jammy raspberry aromas greet you, followed by dry spice, light oak and milk chocolate scents. The palate is warm, mildly rich and resiny, with oaky flavors of pepper, spice and black fruit. Finishes quite sweet but also peppery due to the oak treatment.",Malbec
Argentina,"The best of the 2008 batch of Trapiche single-vineyard Malbecs is this one from Jorge Miralles' vineyard. Dark, smoky and elegant on the nose, with blackberry, cassis and toasty spice flavors. It's juicy, deep and balanced, with a long, sultry, smooth finish. Pure and showing nary a fault. Drink now through 2015.",Malbec
Argentina,"Amazingly ripe and deep wine from 2004, so it's all that it's going to be. Thick and figgy aromas bring bacon, mint and cool, cushiony cola notes. The palate is megasaturated with chocolaty oak and dark berry power galore. Remains oaky on the finish; a massive wine to drink now through 2017.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Although this wine is entering its late stages of freshness, the bouquet is nice and tropical smelling. The palate maintains its vitality, even if it's a bit oily in texture, while the flavors of lychee, melon and apple are good.",White Blend
Argentina,"A bit fiery and piercing upfront, this wine features fresh berry aromas but not much complexity. The palate is medium in weight and clean, with lightly herb-influenced flavors of plum, berry and tomato. It finishes herbal, peppery and spicy. A blend of 50% each Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Robust berry and plum aromas come with ample toast and spice. The palate has a crisp, focused feel and kicking black fruit and berry flavors. Finishes bright, solid and toasty, with a controlled coffee-like bitterness. Very nice wine; only 200 cases produced.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Chunky on the nose, but also sort of rubbery, brambly, pickled and leathery. The palate is stretched and strained, with wiry acidity and piercing tannins supporting rubbery black fruit flavors. Grabby, tannic and a little hot on the finish. Good but on the sharp, underwhelming side.",Malbec
Argentina,"Chunky, earthy, malty and fruity all at the same time, but clacky and tough in the mouth, with big, grabby tannins supporting generic black fruit flavors. An aggressive, hard wine with sappy, jammy flavors; it delivers full kick and size.",Syrah
Argentina,"Bold and minty, with no shortage of tarry, rubbery black-fruit aromas. The palate is full, meaty, tough and tannic, with heat and candied, confected flavors that suggest chocolate-covered cherry and kirsch. Finishes sweet and candied, with average structure and stuffing.",Syrah
Argentina,"Opens with grassy notes along with cleaner, fruitier cherry and cassis aromas. The palate is medium bodied, with forward, jammy flavors of blackberry. Finishes flush but simple, with softness as opposed to a strong backbone of heavy tannins.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Rather jammy, murky and generic on the nose, with black-fruit aromas that center around plum and blackberry. The palate is edgy but fresh, with snappy, tarry black-fruit flavors. Feels rugged, rough and tannic but gets the job done in its price range.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dense, inky and sweet on the nose, with cassis, melted Swiss chocolate and well-integrated spice aromas. The palate has size and acidity, with toasty, creamy flavors of baked black fruits and coconut. Long on the finish, with vanilla and mocha; ripe, delicious and potent. Drink now through 2016.",Malbec
Argentina,"Appealing from the start, with minerality, crustiness and tight dark berry aromas. The palate is saturated and layered, with flavors of blackberry, coffee and chocolate. Offers grip and structure due to fine tannins, and it's ready to drink now.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This wine starts with rough aromas of black fruit and horseradish before turning earthy and leathery. The mouthfeel is mostly good, with rubbery tannins, and the palate bears flavors of baked red berry and herb. This is not run of the mill; it's unusual, fruity, hot and wild.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is a honest Pinot, featuring tea, dry raspberry and herb aromas. It offers a light mouthfeel in support of mildly leafy, rooty flavors of raspberry and plum. Earthy and nicely oaked, with a rooty finish.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Baked raspberry, leather and stalky herb aromas create an earthy nose. It feels good but a touch flat, with creamy, chewy plum and berry flavors that finish with sweetness. Good in a regular, everyday sense.",Malbec
Argentina,"Apple, pear and oak aromas blend well. The palate on this tropical-leaning Chardonnay tastes citrusy but soft, with more flesh than acid. Flavors of nectarine, citrus and melon are good but not overly refined. Feels wide on the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Full and concentrated, with aromas of roasted blackberry, cassis and plum. The palate is solid and offers a pleasant and proper mouthfeel, while the flavors of cassis, raspberry and plum satisfy and come with only a touch of herbal essence. Dark on the finish, with follow through.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Roasted and rubbery on first take, with aromas of leather, beefy blackberry and a pinch of herbal juniper and sharpness. The palate is racy and flows well, with lightly herbal flavors of red plum, raspberry and leather. Long on the finish, with a juicy feel.",Malbec
Argentina,"Starts out mildly murky and leafy, with a leathery, dry nose. The palate is herbal, tight and juicy due to a high acid level, with red berry and peppery, mildly herbal flavors. A good, average wine with oak showing up on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Initially you get nothing but herbs, spice and tomato off this Bordeaux blend. The nose deals bell pepper, red pepper flake and tomato such that it smells more like chimichurri than wine. But with airing it improves to reveal dry strawberry, cherry and herbal spice flavors. More saucy, green and savory than fruity, and probably past its prime; but still it's offering some mature class and style.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Dark, rubbery aromas include black cherry, leather and cheesy notes. The palate is fairly high in acid, producing juiciness but also tartness and a lean, sinewy body housing snappy cherry, spice and herbal flavors. Good but prickly.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Aromas of buttercup, melon and lychee maintain their basic freshness but seem on the heavy side. The palate is similar; it's both chalky and heavy. Flavors of apple, melon and nectarine are solid but slightly bitter, and the finish is grabby and sticky.",Torrontés
Argentina,"This is heady but flat on the nose, with soft, oak-driven aromas of baked apple and toffee. It feels plump yet alive due to good acidity, while the flavor profile is steered by the barrel, leaving notes of toasty apple and walnut. A good wine but one that really piles on the oak and resin.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Very black in color, this blend is soft and fleshy on the nose. The palate is blocky, big and jammy, while the flavors are leathery and herbal, delivering notes of blackberry and plum. It finishes full, stewed and meaty, with a soupy accent. Good for a wide-bodied wine.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"This appears light and rusty in the glass, with a distant aroma of floral cherry and not much more. It feels sheer and fresh, with fiery red-fruit flavors of cranberry and plum. Fades away with acidity and a juicy strawberry note.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"A little bit hickory-dominated on the bouquet, but also giving balsamic notes, blackberry and chocolate mint. The palate is linear due to a streak of cutting acidity, while the palate is also snappy with wild raspberry and bright plum flavors and plenty of wood tannin. A toasty finish with espresso and chocolate is fine and long. Drink now through 2017.",Malbec
Argentina,"A thick-styled Bonarda with honest berry and peppery spice aromas. It's borderline syrupy in feel, with a streak of acidity to keep it balanced. Flavors of plum, wild berry and currant lean towards red, while the finish is long and strong, albeit sticky and weighty.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Blueberry, spice, sandalwood and foresty aromas are the good elements; funky, foxy additions not so much. The palate sports a raw, scratchy feel with hard tannins that go with strawberry, plum and vanilla flavors. Tastes and feels lactic on the finish, with a snappy offset. Good Malbec but it struggles to achieve harmony and total balance.",Malbec
Argentina,"Chocolaty raspberry and plum aromas are oaky and hint at vanilla. The palate is fairly soft, with freshening acidity hoisting up sweet plum and blackberry jam flavors. Rich and stout late, with molasses on the finish. More easy and ready than tannic and firm.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dark, rubbery aromas lead to a simple, sweet, baked, candied palate that also offers a touch of acidity and some balancing bitterness. The wine blends a fair amount of candied sweetness with a touch of butter, pepper and herbal notes. Standard fare as Malbec goes.",Malbec
Argentina,"Full but roasted and rubbery, with baked berry aromas leading to a thick, semistewed palate with dark berry and vanilla flavors. The palate is big but choppy, and the finish is also thick and tannic. Definitely round and meaty, but slips to the stewy side.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Slightly sharp and herbal upon first impression, with green herb and field-like aromas along with rubbery, earthy black fruit. The palate is mulled and a touch edgy, with herbal, lightly stemmy berry flavors. Decent as a whole, but sort of sharp, herbal and stemmy for a higher-end wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is minty, crusty and frankly a bit harsh on the bouquet, where aromas turn charred and burnt. It feels roasted and chunky, with hickory-smoked flavors of clove and berry. The finish vacillates between being oaky and herbal.",Malbec
Argentina,"This wine is characteristic of Salta in its initial hit of patented leafy, earthy, roasted aromas and subsequent entrance of brash, grabby tannins. Nutty, roasted flavors of baked berry, toffee, coffee and earth come next.",Red Blend
Argentina,"This wine smells a bit soapy, with citrusy aromas. It feels level, solid and soft, with melon, sweet pear and candied papaya flavors. It finishes sweet, as if a teaspoon of powdered sugar were part of the equation. A friendly but simple white wine made of 85% Torrontés and 15% Riesling.",White Blend
Argentina,"Deep and lush, with aromas of blackberry, cassis and coffee. This is actually a better, more balanced wine than the winery's Gran Misterio because it isn't over the top and overoaked. Flavors of mocha, coffee and mulled berry are on the money, while the chocolaty finish is smooth. Drink now due to low acidity.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A natural type of blended white with vanilla, powdered sugar, peach, pear and citrus on the bouquet. The palate is fresh and zesty, with apple, citrus and peach flavors, and no oak, resin or toast foisted into the glass. Nicely focused throughout, with a good mouthfeel. Chardonnay with 15% each of Sauvignon Blanc and Torrontés.",White Blend
Argentina,"The first impression is all about raisin and prune, aromas that suggest overripeness. Despite that sweetness, the palate is deep, saturated and layered, with dark berry and raisin flavors along with fig, spice and chocolate. Very rich and softly built; best if you like sweeter, richer reds. Drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"A pungent aromatic brew of stewy plum, burnt rubber, grilled meat and leather leads to a high-acid, spiky palate featuring herbal plum and tangy black currant flavors. Packs punch on the nose and throughout, with aggressiveness at all check points.",Malbec-Merlot
Argentina,"Briary aromas start with some funk and animal then settle down and clean up. The palate has a nice, layered feel and earthy flavors of berry, cassis and herbs. Finishes long, chocolaty and spicy, with freshness. 60% Malbec with 30% Cabernet and 10% Syrah.",Red Blend
Argentina,"This starts out with textbook aromas of red and black fruits that are pure and easy to get into. It shows kick on the palate, with oaky flavors of coffee and chocolate that accent ripe berry and mild herb notes. It's toasty and spicy on the finish, with a gritty feel.",Malbec
Argentina,"Potent and herbal, this has aromas of tomato, olive, mineral and tobacco. It feels tight, drying and lively, with herb-infused flavors of plum and berry along with spicy oak. Rich in feel, but it's distinctly foresty and herbal tasting on the finish. This is 100% Malbec with an undeniable Salta imprint.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smells a bit heavy, oily and like dry cornflakes. The palate is  straightforward, with tropical, candied flavors of mango, banana and sweet melon. Sweetness is the key here; it's all over the palate and finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A Malbec-led blend that's off the grid by Argentine standards but which reflects the northern Salta region. The nose is earthy, herbal, roasted and tomatoey, while the palate is astringent and roasted, with herbal, spicy flavors of tomato, bell pepper and baked berries. Long and baked on the finish, with a slight fiery feel.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Murky and leathery on first take, with dry, earthy red fruit aromas emerging later on. The palate is fresh enough, with snappy acidity and tannic bite along with wan, mild fruit flavors and spice. Perfectly adequate but short on stuffing and depth.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lightly herbal and red in character, with tomato and raspberry aromas. The palate is snappy and emphasizes freshness, while the flavors are herbal and leafy, with plenty of red berry and cherry. Snappy and pointed, with a leafy overriding personality.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Good wine but a touch stemmy and burnt smelling. After the brushy, herbal aromas comes a juicy, crisp red fruit palate with raspberry and plum flavors but also a bit of green at the core. Finishes bold but a little hot and scratchy.",Malbec
Argentina,"This smells of rubber, plastic, creamy milk chocolate and berry. The wine has good body, but the oak element has a greasy, buttery taste. Core flavors of herbal plum and berry end with a leathery finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Talcum powder and apple aromas accompany a big whiff of resinous oak. On the palate, it's tropical in both feel and flavors, with plenty of weight and aggressive tastes of pineapple and mango. Feels a bit sticky and not quite precise, with a chunky finish.",Chardonnay-Viognier
Argentina,"Full and dark from the beginning, with black plum, floral notes and a clean overall presentation. It's full, zesty and has proper mouthfeel, while the flavors of berry, toast and herbs are honest and generous. Stylish on the finish; nice Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rubbery and gaseous at first, but with time weighty, meaty black fruit aromas come out. The wine carries a rich, syrupy mouthfeel and dense, dark flavors of blackberry and pepper. Chunky on the finish, which is thick in feel but short in length.",Malbec
Argentina,"Spicy and bricky on the nose, with tobacco, earth and herbal red berry aromas. The palate is round and tight, with roasted cassis and berry flavors along with a dusty aftertaste. Sweet on the finish, like brown sugar and roasted berries.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A black-fruit aroma comes with accents of tobacco and prune but also a strong, almost vegetal green angle. It feels nice and full, with green-leaning flavors of spiced berry and juniper. Tobacco, bitter lettuce and green bean notes all make appearances on the finish. This is a blend of 80% Malbec and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Red Blend
Argentina,"This is dusty and smooth up front, with plenty of oak, balsamic, plum and berry aromas. Showing overall harmony, it feels sure and secure, with depth and solid flavors of toasty berry and bitter chocolate. It tastes similarly on the finish, with a jammy feel. A blend of 80% Malbec with 10% Bonarda and 10% Syrah.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Clean, timid and melony on the nose, with an emphasis on clean. Fresh and light in the mouth, and tasty despite being 100% uncomplicated. Flavors of sweet apple, pear and citrus are pleasant and should carry mass appeal. Good for an everyday white quaffer.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Neutral smelling other than a hint of peach and vanilla on the bouquet. Comes across a bit heavy and warm, but not too much so. Flavors of soft melon are appealing, and the finish is fleshy. Drink now before it loses its spunk.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Earthy and leathery smelling, but very much on the light-bodied side for Malbec. The palate is angular and slightly acidic, with juicy, spicy red-cherry flavors. Racy and lean on the finish, with a final wash of cleansing acids.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lean, mildly green aromas offer minimal fruit, and there's a salinic, swimming pool set of aromas as well. The palate is fairly thick and solid, with big tannins and flavors of candied fruits and carob that lean toward green. Shows big body and weight, but the nose is only fair while the flavors are herbal.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Among Catena's high-end wines from 2007, Nicasia is the top performer. It shows alluring aromas of smoky oak, wild flowers and pure berry fruits. The palate is a blend of smoothness, grainy tannins and fine acidity, while the flavors of berries, chocolate and cola are layered just right. Still the pacesetter for high-end Argentine Malbec; drink now through 2015.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fruity, pure and smooth on the nose, and maybe more dry and leathery than the blasting Nicasia vineyard wine. The palate has a deep, classy elegance along with power, and the flavors run toward huge black fruits, coffee and chocolate. Finishes dark, long and minerally, and overall it's yet another awesome top-flight Malbec from this world-class winery. Drink now through 2014.",Malbec
Argentina,"This smells candied and oddly citrusy, with unusual blueberry and exotic spice aromas. The mouthfeel is fresh and grabby, while the flavors of raspberry and vanilla are generally appealing and alert. Short on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"A foxy berry aroma and a jammy character define the nose on this jumpy, juicy Bonarda. Although it tastes fresh, it doesn't offer a whole lot of structure or seriousness. It tastes candied and full of berry and buttery oak flavors. There's a vanilla note on the finish.",Bonarda
Argentina,"This is an easy type of wine made from Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. It opens with simple, familiar aromas of jammy berry and milk chocolate, followed by a creamy-textured palate, with thickness and oaky flavors of hickory, raspberry jam and vanilla. Beyond that, it doesn't offer much complexity or nuance.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A lusty value made right. The nose issues black cherry, cough drop and cassis aromas. It's concentrated and balanced, while flavors of black cherry and cassis follow the nose. A mild tannic burn and chocolate on the finish tell you it's good and can go with any meat, from burgers to a quality steak or roast.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Rustic on first blush, with smoky, lightly baked berry fruit aromas. It's rubbery and grabby in the mouth, with sweet caramel and brown sugar accents to the core baked berry fruit flavors. Toasty and peppery on the finish, then sweet as it fades out. A little hot at 14.8% alcohol.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A touch rubbery and medicinal if you get deep into the bouquet, with sizable berry aromas to boot. The palate is comfortable and balanced, with earthy black fruit flavors that suggest fig and blackberry. Toasty and chocolaty on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Yellow in color, with baked corn, heavy oak and implied sweetness on the bouquet. The palate is almost syrupy in feel, with sugary flavors of baked pear, apple and butterscotch. Finishes weighty and heavy; almost like a late-harvest wine. Drink immediately.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Orange blossom, nectarine and almond skin aromas are true to the grape and inviting. The palate maintains a light, juicy, citric feel as it delivers flavors of melon, apple and banana. Fresh and forward, with a hint of heat and bitterness to the finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"A bit shocking and overpowering initially, with pull-back early aromas and alcohol-related burn. Give it time and it displays itself as a full, ripe, complex wine with heavy extraction and ripe peach, apricot and bitter flavors. Toffee and caramel lead the spicy, still-bitter finish.",Muscat
Argentina,"This is a jammy, dense and pure Cabernet, with meat and berry aromas that mix in touches of graphite and chocolate. It feels a little hard and acidic despite its size, while the flavor profile is of mossy berry fruit and chocolate. Tight and nervy, this offers lots of acidic push on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Tropical and blowsy on the nose. The palate is now chunky and heavy, while the flavors are mustardy and oily, with fruit notes that fall into the melon, peach and orange field. Flat and short on the finish, which indicates that it's already fading. Better to wait for the 2010.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Light and herbal on the nose, with a dilute set of raspberry and strawberry aromas. The palate has some creaminess but overall it tastes generic and baked, with syrupy sweetness at its core. An average wine with jammy qualities and focus issues.",Malbec
Argentina,"More leafy and mulchy than ideal, with coffee, herbal notes and a light green quality to the nose. The feel is starchy, and the flavors run burnt, mildly green and sweet, with a pasty, sticky finish. Has some merit but also falls a little short.",Malbec
Argentina,"Light and airy, with orange blossom and powdered sugar aromas. The palate is round and offers enough crisp acidity to keep the wine's lychee and lemon-lime flavors moving in the right direction. Reasonably good for ten bucks.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Dark purple in color, with a simple, candied, somewhat strained nose. The palate feels sharp while the acidity-tannin combo creates a narrowing mouthfeel. Flavors are roasted, herbal and lemony, while the finish is jumpy and edgy.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A little stinky and oily, which is often the downfall of the variety. The palate has a viscous grab to it and the flavors are rather generic and rudimentary, i.e. simple apple and melon with a mild chemical burn. Seems only semifresh at a young age.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Smells foxy and broken up, with a slight stemminess. The palate is tannic and drawing, with generic black fruit flavors that are candied with brown sugar and molasses. Sweet, rough, tough and like 1,000 others. Will do best with food, which should absorb some of the tannic shock.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This is a frisky type of Chardonnay with little to no oak character. The nose is purely tropical, with melon and lychee aromas. The palate is zesty but a bit hollow, with flavors of green apple, peach and lychee.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"An apple aroma comes with a tinge of mild oak, turning fleshy and less fresh with airing. The palate includes flavors of melon, apple and green herb, while the finish is pithy and citrusy, revealing a touch of green onion.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Foresty, rubbery and brash, this has toasty, woody, cheesy and berry-driven aromas. It feels creamy and heavy, with herbal and salty flavors that finish with a roasted, meaty taste. Warm, heavy and ponderous.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is a perfectly solid, fresh Torrontés, with lime, pineapple and banana aromas and similar flavors. Add in some acid-based agility and lift, and this ranks as an everyday quaffer of the first order. Drink immediately.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Butter and coconut aromas announce the liberal use of oak, which the palate echoes with its round, resiny feel and flavors of vanilla, wood and baked pear. This is soft, flat and sugary tasting, with an oaky finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"This smells bland but clean, with a hint of citrus. It feels spritzy but simple, with papaya, green melon and mild citrus flavors. Good in a very basic way, but drink now before it fades.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Tropical in scent, almost to the point of air freshener, this also has an oily, bitter hint to the bouquet. It feels choppy and citric, with a nuttiness to the core of tangerine, lemon and melon flavors. Good but fading.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Ripe, rubbery berry aromas become like chocolate-covered cherry with time. The palate is full and a bit syrupy, while the palate is creamy and sweet, with baked blackberry and peppery flavors. Sweet and soft on the finish, with herbs and a touch of coffee-like bitterness.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Rooty aromas of tree bark, cola, tobacco and sweet briar set up a plump, tannic palate with roasted, sweet flavors of Mission fig, dark berry and spice. It's easygoing and loamy on the finish, with chewy tannins and not too much bite.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dense, meaty and lightly herbal on the nose, with minty berry notes. The palate is firm and issues tannic crack in front of plum, herbal flavors, brown sugar and vanilla. Turns mildly hot and grating on the finish, with juicy length. Good for everyday Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Full berry aromas with spice on the side form a good opening. It's a full, tight wine on the palate with oaky, meaty, almost foresty flavors of blackberry, spice and mint. Racy, drying, tasty and good given that one finds few Syrah-Bonarda blends to pick from.",Syrah-Bonarda
Argentina,"A bit gaseous on the nose, with cidery apple aromas. The palate is waxy, oily and heavy, with chunky melon and papaya flavors. Meaty and full-bodied for a value-priced Chard, but also heavy and struggling for balance.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Rubbery and muddled at first, then more clarity arises with airing. The palate is firm, rather lean and acidic, with angular berry and cassis flavors. Finishes on the sharp side, with snappy, pointed acidity and crispness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Mildly tropical on the nose, but for the most part the bouquet lacks punch. The palate has friction and an oily feel, while the flavors are generic as they suggest apple and lime. Chalky and kind of bland on the finish; seems to be fading.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Earthy aromas mix with high-toned red fruit scents, while the palate is narrow and linear, with mildly green, saucy flavors that crowd out mild red fruit notes that fight to enter the picture. Herbal on the finish, but not offensive or difficult to drink.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A blend of Riesling, Albariño and Savagnin that's more novel than impressive. The nose offers light citrus and spice, the body is creamy and soft, and the palate sweet with papaya, melon and pineapple. Creamy on the finish as well, and low in acidity.",White Blend
Argentina,"Other than showing orange and tangerine, the nose is a bit too much like air freshener. In the mouth, it's wet but on the hollow side, with dilute innocuous flavors. Decent but low on flavor; seemingly fading.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Young, fiery and rugged on the nose, but with exotic notes that suggest Middle Eastern and Asian herbs and spices. Like all Cobos Malbecs, this is big, chewy, brawny and a touch medicinal, with powerful dark fruit flavors, particularly black cherry, and a good deal of licorice, chocolate and overall richness. Handles its 15% alcohol better than many heavyweights; drink now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"Full and deep berry aromas are the greeting. The wine is rock solid and full in body, with lusty blackberry and wild raspberry flavors along with spice and nice tannins. A complete, balanced, uncomplicated Malbec that gets it right.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark, rubbery and black on the nose, then medium across the palate, with a good mouthfeel and evidence of refinement. The flavors are deep and classy, emphasizing plum and raspberry along with an herbal undertone. Toasty and oaky late, with espresso-like bitterness to the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dense on the nose, with a mix of black fruit aromas and mild herbs. The palate is properly acidic and elevated, with complex flavors of coconut, plum, berry, mocha, chocolate and spice. Quite oaky but the oak comes across well, i.e. friendly mocha and coffee. 64% Malbec with 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Tannat.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"A cool cherry aroma and a mild, creamy paste note open the nose. The feel is fiery and untamed, while full flavors of cherry and plum seem raw. A cocoa flavor and juicy feel define the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"An oily popcorn aroma mixes with a tropical fruit note on this midlevel Torrontés. It feels round and chunky on the palate, with flavors of pineapple and citrus. The finish deals both sweet banana and lemon notes.",Torrontés
Argentina,"This smells wild, with a jumpy cherry aroma. The palate is huge and tannic in the mouth, and it's blasting with minty oak, marshmallow and black fruit flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dry and raw on the nose, this Pinot includes hints of tomato and citrus. It feels creamy and oaky, with vanilla-infused flavors of plum and berry.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Stalky in scent, this is underwhelming on the nose. It feels adequate and solid, with basic raspberry, strawberry and spice flavors. Scratchy on the finish, with mild red-fruit flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"This wine takes you on a trip to an outer wine world where deep, cushioned berry aromas come with exotic perfumes, bath oils and crushed flower petals. It's ultrasaturated and jammy, but not clunky or heavy. This tastes like a storm of blackberry, espresso and Swiss chocolate, while black spices and length bring up the rear. A blend of 50% Malbec, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cab Franc; drink now–2017.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Rubbery and smoky at first, with earthy, leathery aromas. Snappy, crisp and juicy in the mouth, with honest PN flavors of light red fruits, toast and oak-based spice and chocolate. Dry, clean and a bit hot on the finish.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Full, dark and smoky on the nose, then juicy, tight and well built on the palate. Tastes good, with fast-moving black fruit and chocolate flavors fading quickly into a clean, moderate finish. Lively and tight for Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Shiny pink in color, with youthful, crisp aromas of cherry and watermelon. Zesty and fresh on the tongue, with spunky cherry and raspberry flavors that finish with natural sweetness. Candied to an extent, but mostly it's fresh and balanced.",Rosé
Argentina,"Thick and concentrated aromas feature barrel-driven toast, lemon peel and savory berry. It's rather flat, sweet and jammy in the mouth, with buttery berry fruit and then a sugary candy flavor. Very sweet and soft on the finish; needs more edge, spine, acidity and clarity to rank higher.",Malbec
Argentina,"Minerally and dry smelling, with floral aromas along with the scents of white peach and apple. The palate feels good and clean, with roundness matched by nice acidity. Flavors of spiced apple and pith are supported by zestiness, while the finish is honest. Not many value-priced Viogniers can match this.",Viognier
Argentina,"Smoky and dark from the start, with char and earth aromas to go with basic blackberry. The palate delivers power and a good texture, with bold blackberry and peppery flavors. Becomes more rubbery as it opens but holds onto its plum and chocolaty virtues.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Crisp and a little minty smelling, with wild berry and dry spice as the primary aromas. It's thick and chunky but well balanced, with sweet, slightly medicinal flavors of black fruits and mint. Solid and smooth on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Balsam wood, pencil eraser, coconut, anise and blackberry aromas share the bouquet. It feels linear and a touch scratchy, with roasted berry and toasted flavors that steer toward bacon. It feels a little gritty and short on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big, rubbery and smoky, with exotic fruit aromas that seem roasted. The palate is tough, tannic and clipped, with herbal, thick flavors of berry, baking spices and coffee. Finishes big but flat and hard, with lasting herbal flavors.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Funky and sharp at first, with aromas of a dog fresh out of the rain. The palate is choppy and a bit hot, with sharp, generic cherry flavors along with some carob. Finishes with angular, tart flavors and notes of coffee and mocha.",Malbec
Argentina,"Chunky on the nose, with flat aromas of apple and peach. The palate has a melony feel and sweet flavors of mango and mandarin orange. Finishes sort of heavy and tropical, with a little leftover heat. Good enough but highly regular.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Smells a bit waxy and grassy, with mild, distant white-fruit aromas. The palate feels pithy and chalky, with generic citrus flavors and then citrus pith on the back end. Finishes with more pithiness and white grapefruit.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Warm and saucy aromas suggest a bit of leafiness and volatility. The palate is rather tannic and somewhat hot, with leafy, herbal cherry and raspberry flavors. Finishes similarly, with pepper and herbal flavors.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Hefty but kind of flat on the bouquet, with tomato and herb aromas. The palate has tannic bite and dark, candied flavors of sweet berry and burnt brown sugar. Finishes peppery, with a lingering candied, burnt sweetness.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Fairly bland on the nose, with only a pinch of mild peach and candle wax. The palate is full but wholly generic in terms of flavors: look for sweet pineapple in front of a soft, almost cloying finish. Drink now.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Funky at first and simply not as smooth, pure and clean as Catena's Nicasia and Adrianna Malbecs, which are the components of this wine. Argentino in 2007 is deep and dark like always, with coconut and cassis aromas preceding a sweet, ultrarich palate that's teetering on candied. Quite oaky and chocolaty as well, with brown sugar and depth to the finish. Drink now through 2014.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big, lush and tightly structured, with cola and mocha aromas along with serious black fruit power and brightness. A pure and delicious Malbec-Cabernet wine with the full allotment of berry character, cola accents, dark spice and clarity. Drink now through 2014.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Sweet on the nose, with licorice and black pepper dust along with ripe black fruit aromas. The palate is deep and pure, with black fruit flavors and a slightly syrupy underbelly. Burns a little on the finish, with spice and fig flavors providing depth and character. 416 cases produced.",Malbec
Argentina,"Perfumed aromas of lemon verbena and wild flower are reminiscent of air freshener. The palate is a bit heavy, but solid acidity provides necessary cut. Flavors of vanilla and spice are a little funky, while the finish is also oaky.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Light, uncommitted aromas of pear and lemon lead to a modest palate that offers fleshy melon and pear flavors. Everything about this wine is mild, including the finish, which offers little besides vanilla and cream flavors.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Solid and brimming with more potential than it's displaying, this Bordeaux-style blend of Malbec, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon starts with aromas of graham cracker, lush berry and pastry. It feels perfectly framed by acidity and tannins, with spicy, complex blackberry and cassis flavors. Toasty and a mile long on the finish, drink this from 2014–2020.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Fairly herbal on first take, with green, peppery core aromas coming with wood spice and black fruit. The palate is firm and clacky, with tannic clamp and jammy flavors of baked plum that turn candied the longer it airs out. Sweet and jammy by the time it finishes.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A challenging white wine that bears a resemblance to Bordeaux Sémillon. The nose starts out sweaty and with phosphorous, but it turns more honeyed and complex with airing. The palate is plump and balanced, with layered honey, melon, apple and pith flavors. By the time it finishes up, it's showing complexity, butterscotch and white pepper notes. Interesting but not for all.",Sémillon
Argentina,"Dry, spicy aromas work well with core raspberry and earthy notes. The palate has a healthy mouthfeel and honest flavors of brown sugar, toast and black cherry. Spice and tempered caramel flavors grace the finish, which has vigor and confirms the value factor and overall quality.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Vanilla and toast aromas are prominent but the fruit is so subdued that overall the wine is out to lunch. Snappy and showing okay acidity in the mouth, but the flavors are dull and melony, with toasty vanilla notes that don't help it enough.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Light and tomatoey in color, with dry, cheesy, earthy aromas. The palate is dilute but has sticky tannins, and the flavors are tangy, citrusy and not overly sound. Finishes roasted and clumsy. An awkward wine.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah
Argentina,"Neutral on the nose except for mild hay and/or straw aromas. The palate is a bit weighty for being so short on flavor. Speaking of which, the wine is clean but tastes hollow, with only sparse flavors of peach and nectarine registering.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Floral, sweet and powdery smelling, but pleasant. The palate is light and airy, with hardly any punch or kick. But that serves it well, and amid the sheets there's lime, green-apple notes and tropical shadings. Not bad for the price.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Raw on the nose, with a hard, tannic palate that features sweet black-fruit flavors, a chemical burn and raisin. The more time you spend with it, the darker and more raisiny it becomes. Finishes roasted, with licorice and rock-hard tannins.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Neutral smelling with a hint of lemon-lime and children's vitamin. The palate is wet but doesn't bring much more in the way of feel, while the flavors are flat, melony and hint at apple. This wine is old by PG standards but not yet dead. It's hanging in there.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Neutral on the nose except for a smidgen of lychee and citrus. The palate is standard and generic, with bland peach, melon and pithy flavors. Finishes light and peachy, with weight and fading acidity.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Earth and rubber aromas dominate the nose, which isn't what you'd call fresh or inviting. The palate improves only slightly, with piercing acidity pressing green-leaning plum and berry flavors. Oaky on the finish and marginal overall.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fairly muddled and earthy at first blush, with a leafy, raisiny, burnt set of aromas. Tastes and feels mealy, with roasted cherry and raspberry flavors and then a leathery finish. Hints at quality but doesn't bring it home; and it seems tired.",Red Blend
Argentina,"An odd bird on the nose, where floral, lavender aromas replace the normal set of cassis and berry. In the mouth, it's so tannic that it's like chewing nails; the flavors, therefore, seem choppy and hard, like roasted blackberry and sugar beets. Very woody and mentholated, too.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Built like a brick house, with ripe, red aromas. This isn't light and elegant in the Italian style; it's mega ripe, with a ton of cherry, spice, kick and chocolate. Medicinal at times, peppery at others, and deep and wild throughout. Drink now through 2017.",Nebbiolo
Argentina,"Very ripe and leaning towards raisiny on the nose, with baked berry and brushed leather notes. The palate is full and aggressive, with a mix of herbed berry, tobacco and spice flavors. Finishes dry and tannic, with chocolate and a slightly syrupy aftertaste.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Big and smoky on the nose, this is hard to peg as Pinot Noir. The mouth is grabby and leaves the feeling of extract and residue as it progresses to the finish. Flavors include candied berry and baked plum.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"This smells leathery at first, and then it turns foresty and raw. It has a blocky, concentrated mouthfeel and herb-tinged plum and red berry flavors. It remains herbal without much fruit on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Aromas of mealy fruit are offset by scents of air freshener and barrel-derived cinnamon. This feels regular and round, with simple apple and wood-spice flavors. The finish tastes wheaty, with a plump feel.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"This opens with a heavy black-cherry aroma that's topped with a hint of leaf and a whiff of plastic. It feels medicinal and tastes like a mix of cherry cough syrup, oak and mint.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"This Cabernet-Malbec blend starts out with herbal, piquant aromas, with a twinge of volatility and a funky masa scent. It's pretty good on the palate, which is by far the wine's best point, but the flavors are earthy, nutty and herbal, rather than bright and focused. Tasted twice, this note reflects the better bottle.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"Oily, nutty aromas fold in hints of field greens and onions. Apple and citrus flavors are adequate, while the wine feels acidic, with little supporting texture. Tangy, basic stuff with a rough edge.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Bell pepper and tomato aromas, combined with hot and burnt notes, don't make for a very inviting nose. The palate is acidic, leaving tart plum and cranberry flavors in front of an oaky, citrusy finish. Rough and basic.",Malbec
Argentina,"Spicy black cherry aromas are lightly floral, lemony and suggestive of a woodsy candle. The palate is balanced and bold, with ripe blackberry and spicy flavors. Rich, strong and a bit chocolaty on the back end. A winning wine for the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with burnt rubber aromas that soon yield to berry fruit, char and dark chocolate. The palate is snappy and tangy despite feeling full, while the flavors of herbs and berry are quickly replaced by resiny oak. Finishes firm, with herbal notes and carob.",Malbec
Argentina,"Toasty apple aromas are familiar and generic. It's full in the mouth, with an oak-based resiny grab and woody flavors of banana, pear and baked apple. A lot of woodspice lingers on the creamy finish, which is slightly bitter in taste.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"This blend of Syrah, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon is sultry and sexy—like a club dancer. Flashy, brash, deep in color and big in flavor, this has flavors of wild berry, chocolate and cola, with a toasted note. An incredibly ripe wine.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Fleshy and huge on the nose, this has hints of sweet red pepper, blackberry, dark plum and cola. It's pure, powerful and dense on the palate, with chewy tannins. The flavors of roasted berry, cassis and chocolate are layered, and the finish is long, sweet and toasty. This is a modern, bullish, full-bodied Cabernet to drink now–2014. 280 cases produced.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A lovely blend of 60% Malbec, 31% Cabernet Sauvignon, 6% Petit Verdot and 3% Tannat, this is strong, with aromas of coconut, cola, chocolate and pure berry. It's a powerful wine, with a flavorful core of black fruit accented by coffee and burnt toast. Drink now–2018.",Red Blend
Argentina,"This opens with a blast of blueberry, sweet grass and baking spices. On the palate, it feels syrupy and rich, with heavy flavors of caramel, baked berry, vanilla and blackberry jam. Sweet, modern in style and ripe to the max, this has a lush, plush finish of saturated berry and copious oak notes. Only 307 cases were made of this blend of 81% Cabernet and 19% Malbec. Drink now–2016.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"This is the first blend from Alamos, and it sings a nice tune. Rubbery, slightly medicinal aromas give way to a full, honest, bulky wine. Ripe blackberry and cherry flavors rest in front of a good finish that's full of vanilla and chocolate notes. Malbec, Bonarda and Tempranillo are the primary grapes.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Smells resiny and a touch chemical, with cornflakes and vanilla bean notes. The palate is resiny and dusty, with sweet, candied, vanilla-infused flavors that crowd out any fruit that might want to make a stand. Finishes with faux oak notes and more vanilla.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Weak and brambly smelling, with mustardy aromas along with leathery red-fruit scents. The palate is astringent, with tomato, basil and stewed berry flavors. Finishes in similar fashion.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Loud, oily and almost caustic on the nose, with a chemical burn. The palate is better due to its tangy citric flavors, but it's still jumbled and oily, and the finish leaves a burnt-tasting residue.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Roasted and leathery on the nose, without much fruit. The palate is full, rubbery and baked tasting, with herbal berry flavors. Finishes cooked and heavy as well, with a sauciness that overrides any freshness of fruit. A downer compared to the fresher 2008 version.",Malbec
Argentina,Sweet cotton candy and mocha aromas come across as confected and work to obscure a high-acid palate that offers a slight hint of chocolate and mint. More oak comes up on the finish.,Syrah
Argentina,"Strained on the nose, with dirty fruit aromas, gaseousness and candy. The palate is cloying and confected, with muddy, jammy, herbal fruit flavors and a cooked, weedy finish. Bulky but not very good.",Merlot
Argentina,"Roasted and muddy smelling, which isn't uncommon for Cafayate Malbec. The palate is heavy, murky and leafy, with roasted beet and plum flavors. Saucy and herbal as well.",Malbec
Argentina,"Black in color, with a severe, jammy nose that's ominous and heavy. The look and bouquet portend the flavors, which are thick, raisiny and pruney. This is over-the-top heavy and extracted, with an inky outlook and subpar balance.",Malbec
Argentina,"Herbal, green, stemmy Merlot with sourness and compromised aromas, flavors and mouthfeel. Tastes bitter and on the harsh side, with a narrow, grabby finish. Too green and mean, especially for $20.",Merlot
Argentina,"Smells like corn and a burning hay field, and the palate has little to no fruit left. The mouthfeel is wet and grabby, while the finish is bready then turns bitter. On its last legs; wait for 2010.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Vegetal from start to finish, as the aromas begin with tomato and bell pepper. The palate is exactly the same, with baked, earthy, sweet and green flavors. Feels gummy in the mouth, and it's not just herbal on the finish, it's green.",Malbec
Argentina,"Thin and sharp as broken glass, with an herbal, sour flavor profile and a tart, sheering mouthfeel and finish. Compared to previous vintages when this wine impressed, this is a loser. Barely drinkable, it's so lean and sour.",Malbec
Argentina,"Earthy blackberry aromas have a slight baked character. The palate is lush, pure and jammy in feel, with grapey, ripe flavors of black cherry, blackberry and herbs. Finishes warm, spicy and peppery, but with good feel and length.",Malbec
Argentina,"Soft and lightly cedary on the nose, with earthy berry fruit aromas. The palate shows good acidity and balance, with ripe cherry, raspberry and cassis flavors. Smooth on the finish, and overall there aren't any breaks in the fabric.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A bit rooty and smoky on the nose, with grapey, loud flavors of sweet berry, black plum and chocolate. The palate is full of choppy acids that keep it pumping forth, while the finish is richer and more chocolaty, with fig notes. A bruiser, but one that's very good for varietal PV.",Petit Verdot
Argentina,"Big, fleshy and dark in color, with a bold, heavy nose of black fruits, baked richness and sweet characteristics. The palate is chunky and full, with blackberry, baked plum, fig and herbal flavors. A saturated, lusty style of Malbec that's deep like cake and just about as sweet.",Malbec
Argentina,"Potent and dark, with a syrupy nose of mint, blackberry and cream. The palate feel is more choppy than ideal, while the flavors run towards cola, root beer, pepper and baked black fruits. Coconut appears on the finish along with pepper; Malbec, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon comprise this Bordeaux blend.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Smoky, roasted and full on the bouquet, with rich berry and plum aromas. The palate is fleshy, with a chunky middle but just enough tannin and acid to provide structure. Tastes of baked black fruits, fig and herbs. Dry and snappy on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"A big, ripe and pure Malbec with gorgeous berry aromas setting up a lush, yummy palate that pumps forth chewy, delicious blackberry, vanilla and chocolate flavors. Finishes warm and oaky; from a mediocre vintage, it's impressive. From the Chilean Huneeus family and top-flight winemaker/consultant Alvaro Espinoza. Drink now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pure on the nose, with plenty of pop. Aromas of dark black cherry are tight and smoky, with minerality. Flavors of cola and wild-berry fruits are right on the money, and the feel is firm but deep and layered. Offers fine character and ageability. A blend of Malbec from three top vineyards; drink through 2014.",Malbec
Argentina,"A home run in middle-tier Malbec. Excellent power and balance are on display. It's firm, minerally and tight, but with generous berry and cassis aromas and flavors along with ample coffee, spice and mocha qualities. Impressive, especially given the price tag; drink now through 2014.",Malbec
Argentina,"This single-vineyard Malbec proves once again that Achaval-Ferrer does not specialize in textbook wines. It's a terroir-driven hard-body with tight blueberry and cherry aromas and flavors. There's a lot of zest, drive and crispness to the palate, and the finish is tight, layered and long. Drinkable now through 2018.",Malbec
Argentina,"One whiff reveals a roasted peanut aroma that's ultimately leathery and not very fresh. The wine feels tannic and hard, with a short berry flavor and a roasted bitterness that carries the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Light and powdery in scent, this has a distinct note of air freshener. It's fairly creamy on the palate, with lychee and orange flavors that settle into a lime note on the finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Rubbery, stalky and dark smelling for Pinot Noir, this is heavy, ripe and thick across the palate as well. Flavors of creamy berries accompany minty, sticky oak.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Teetering aromas of apple, oak and mineral don't hold much sway, while the palate is both chunky and oversized, sizzling with acid. A muddled flavor of white fruit leads to a finish where nothing sticks out.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"This smells stalky and oily, with a peach pit aroma. It feels citrusy, tangy and a touch bitter, with flavors of white grapefruit, white peach and grass. It shows a tangerine note and a sticky feel on the finish.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"This smells of raw oak, cinnamon and clove, with its fruit essence entirely in the background. It's creamy, chewy and tannic on the palate, with herbal, oaky, resiny flavors of baking spice and modest raspberry.",Malbec
Argentina,"Notes of vanilla, melon and oily bitterness define the nose. The wine feels both creamy and grabby, with pithy, sweet-tasting flavors of melon and peach. A persistent, mild bitterness downgrades the finish.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"This is rich, dense and sultry smelling, with cola, vanilla, char, coconut and wild berry aromas. It feels strapping and pure, with deep flavors of chocolate and blackberry offset by oak-driven spice and cedar. Toasty and spicy, the finish possesses a fudge-like richness. Best from 2013–2016.",Malbec
Argentina,"This opens with an aromatic blast of spice, leather, coconut, cassis and blackberry. Plump and sturdy on the palate, it has fine acidity, smooth tannins and flavors of roasted, spicy blackberry and chocolate. With baking spice and barrel-driven flavors on the finish, this is a beautiful wine to drink from 2013–2018.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is a stacked Malbec-led blend, with pure blackberry, prune, cola and graphite aromas. It feels super healthy and ripped, with toasty black-fruit flavors topped with vanilla and peppery spice. The finish is toasty, dark and full of licorice. Only 500 cases were made. Drink now–2014.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Smoky, staunch and controlled on the bouquet, this has lead pencil, blackberry and vanilla aromas. It feels pure and full, with plum, berry, creamy oak and vanilla flavors. The finish is long, balanced and complex; overall this is an excellent, full-bodied Malbec that delivers the goods. Drink now–2015.",Malbec
Argentina,"A fruity, jammy style of Cab with thick berry aromas resting in front of a full-bodied, chewy palate with forward red berry and chocolate flavors. This is smooth, not complex and easygoing proof that Argentina is not only about Malbec.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A sappy, jammy nose offers a nice entry to this simple blend of Cabernet and Merlot. The palate feel is regular and healthy, while the flavors run toward generic red fruits with a touch of green herbs and caramel. Snappy and crisp on the finish.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Sweet and floral smelling, with jammy berry fruit pouring out of the bouquet. There's snap and lift to the mouthfeel along with rubbery berry, plum, chocolate and herbal flavors. Tight and grippy on the finish, which has an herbal tinge.",Malbec
Argentina,"Round and floral, with melon and other simple, clean aromas. Good mouthfeel, proper acidity and basic, likable flavors of citrus, green apple, green banana and tropical fruits make it a good quaffer and a good value.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Weird, green, spicy and odd smelling, with hard, green raisiny flavors and an herbal finish. Barely acceptable; not varietally sound or interesting.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A scratchy, sheering wine that pushes up against sour. The palate is almost all acid, and the flavors are underdeveloped, very tart and razor sharp. Clean but hard to deal with.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rubbery and gassy smelling, with overtones of green, herbaceous fruit. The palate is sharp and grating, with pie cherry, sour raspberry and green olive flavors. Turns herbal to excess and finishes substandard.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sweet, rich and clean, with molasses, fig and pure berry fruit aromas. Rich and saturated, but balanced, with blackberry, brown sugar and chocolaty flavors. Finishes fairly long, with spice and some complexity. A surprisingly good bargain Cab.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Earthy and leathery on first blush, with tobacco and jammy berry and bacony aromas. The palate is drawn and firm, with snappy wild berry flavors accented by softer earth notes and coconutty oak. Layered and chocolaty on the finish, with a good fade. 85% Malbec with 15% Cabernet Sauvignon; 200 cases made.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with tarry, cooked aromas but with airing, oak and ripe, earthy berry notes squeak out. The palate is chewy and solid, with extract and tannic grab as well as smoky, sultry flavors of roasted black fruits and bouillon. Meaty and satisfying.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dry red fruit and tomato notes define the nose on this light-colored Pinot. Flavors of earthy cherry and spice get buried under buttery oak, which carries through onto the finish.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"This has an unconvincing bouquet of grass, leather and citrusy red fruit aromas. The wiry palate has soupy, rustic flavors of roasted, leathery berry. Dry and scratchy on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"This smells heavily charred, like a blend of burnt leaf, charcoal-grilled hamburger and funky, roasted berry. The palate feels rough and bumpy, while the flavor profile is herbal to an extreme. Finishes green and soupy.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This grassy, candied specimen smells and feels scratchy, with green, fiery flavors of cherry and strawberry.",Malbec
Argentina,"A waxy aroma contains a spot of citrus, turning stalky with airing. It feels oily and heavy, with stalky flavors of white fruit and orange peel. Finishes bitter and pithy.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Rubbery and leathery smelling at first, with berry and cassis aromas resting below the surface. Feels tannic and closed on the palate, with syrupy, reduced plum, berry and currant flavors. Not too much shows up on the finish other than thickness and a subtle plum nuance.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Round, floral and sweet smelling, with citrusy acidity that pushes up passion fruit, orange and lemon flavors. There's weight and body come finishing time, and the overall impression is that of a tropical, dense white wine with some creaminess. Priced high for what you get.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Good berry and plum aromas send this out in solid form. The palate is full and grabby, with jammy, slightly herbal flavors of blackberry and plum. The finish is medium in length, with size and a spot of heat. Ripe, good and fresh for an under-$10 Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with mellow peach and melon aromas and some oak. The palate is round, creamy and full, but hollow in the center. Tastes of spiced, dried apple with a stalky, pithy accent. Easy and basic on the finish, and overall it's pricey for what's in the bottle.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Baked berry, molasses and roasted, jumbled berry fruit aromas lead to a grabby, full-bodied palate with dark, baked berry and leathery flavors. Toasty and sizable on the finish, with a solid feel and general cleanliness.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
Argentina,"More “red” in style, with medicinal cherry and raspberry aromas leading to a fresh, racy palate with tons of cherry and plum flavor along with a hint of cola and cough drop. Clean and lithe on the finish, with no excess weight or oak. The real deal in terms of freshness and purity of fruit. Drink now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"Powerful from the beginning, with depth of fruit to the nose as well as floral notes. The palate is a bit more simple than I expected; it's fresh and properly acidic but the flavors of berry and black cherry are jammy and there seems to be a hint of overripeness to the wine. Still, it's a dark, lusty Malbec with purity and nice touches of vanilla, mocha and coffee. Drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"From the La Consulta subzone of Mendoza, Altamira is a high-acid Malbec with floral, exotic aromas as well as vivid berry-fruit scents. The palate shows plenty of acidity, and thus the blackberry and blueberry flavors are tangy and borderline tart. Will age well but will never be a lush Malbec. Drink now through 2016.",Malbec
Argentina,"Offers tropical, stony aromas in front of a crystalline palate that's citrusy as well as peachy, with lychee and melon flavors as well. Finishes springy and bright, with green citrus zest and nothing compromising. 60% Torrontés and 40% Chardonnay.",White Blend
Argentina,"Deep, dense Malbec with jammy aromas of blackberry and violet flowers. The palate is thick and meaty but not cloying or oaky, while the plum, berry and currant flavors are appealing. Textured and full, but also bright and healthy.",Malbec
Argentina,"The cool, compromising 2008 vintage conditions are reflected here; the wine is jammy but a little green on the nose and at its core. The feel is heavy, lactic and rich, while the flavors are narrow and jammy, with prune, blackberry and grassy mint. There's both overripe and underripe notes on this high-end blend of 70% Malbec and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Gold in color, with a heavy, mature, resiny nose. But just when you think it's over the hill and overoaked, the palate offers acidity and character. Flavors of apple, melon and spice are barrel-influenced, while acidity props up the finish. Drink now; contains 10% Chardonnay.",Sémillon
Argentina,"Prickly aromas of saline and citrus precede an acidic, spritzy palate that's home to modest mango and melon flavors. Turns rather bitter and oily on the finish.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"This thick, resiny Chardonnay smells like lemon pudding and air freshener. It's flat in feel, with low acidity, pushing creamy banana and vanilla flavors in front of a resiny finish that shows even more vanilla influence. It tastes candied and soft overall.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Chunky cherry and earthy tea aromas lead to a supremely tannic and overbearing body, leaving a residue as it transitions to the finish. Flavors along the way include oak, vanilla, syrupy berry, plastic and creamy chocolate.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"This is stalky smelling, with modest fruit and a burnt field aroma. It looks and tastes weak and transparent, with sourness rising up on the palate along with notes of citrus, cranberry and cherry pie.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Probably the most lush of Alta Vista's three single-vineyard Malbecs from 2009, Alizarine offers coconut, cola and wild berry aromas, with a full-bodied, chunky palate that's packed with coconut, carob, cassis and sweet blackberry flavors. Smooth, oaky and stylish on the finish, this is rewarding now–2015.",Malbec
Argentina,"The palate boasts full tannins and good acidity, with flavors of pastry, chocolate, blackberry, plum and prune that are marked with an undercurrent of spice. Toasty and long, the finish has a strong licorice accent. Drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"Earthy, roasted and condensed on the nose, with a compact, structured palate housing tight plum and cherry flavors. Shows freshness, lift and a good step, with a juicy finish and racy acids.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Rubber, bacon, berry and plum aromas are good overall. The palate is creamy as a whole but has enough acidity to carry cassis and berry flavors past being resiny and herbal. Basic on the finish, with mild oak flavor and resin coming into play.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"On the oaky side, with toasty aromas of stacked wood, smoke and black fruits lurking below the surface. The palate has the typical piercing juiciness of the 2008 vintage, with bursting flavors of pie cherry and raspberry. Minty and oaky on the finish, with snappy finishing acidity. Drink now through 2012.",Malbec
Argentina,"Argento has found its calling with this wine, by far the best to date from this label. It's deep and pure, with raisin, blackberry, spice and vanilla on the nose. Super solid and lush, with layered flavors of jammy berry, coffee and chocolate. Holds all its form on the finish; excellent vino for the dollar.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tropical aromas are fresh and clean, and overall this is an active, juicy wine with bright flavors of pineapple, melon and lime. There's pop, proper acids and drive to the finish; shows the good elements of the grape at an easy-to-swallow price.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Rich, sweet and ripe up front, with aromas of molasses, black fruits and spice. The palate is concentrated and full, with roasted, beefy flavors of berry, plum and spice. A sizable finish anchors the wine's weighty personality. Big and generous given the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lime and floral notes create a light and breezy bouquet that's easygoing. In the mouth, it's juicy and fresh, with lemon-lime, peach, nectarine and lychee flavors. Tangy and fresh on the finish, and more precise and delicate than most Argentinean Torrontés.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Despite leafy, herbal, briney notes, the nose on this four-grape blend is earthy, subtle and attractive. The palate is full and concentrated, with flavors of roast meat, spice, herbs and baked berry fruits. Finishes savory. 40% each Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with 10% each Malbec and Pinot Noir.",Red Blend
Argentina,"At 90% Tempranillo, this is not your average Argentine red. The nose is lean and hot, with spice that grows on you. The palate is piercing, but amid the acid and racy cherry and raspberry fruit are touches of elegant dryness, olive, leaves and old Rioja. Will age for a decade due to blazing acidity.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Rusty in color, this wine features aromas of compost, juniper and a touch of floral red fruit. It comes on strong in the mouth, with a leafy, rustic dried-cherry flavor, before feeling hard and tannic.",Malbec
Argentina,"Torrontés is not known for aging well in the bottle, and this one is almost past its prime. There's some tropicality left on the nose, but it mostly smells sweaty. Flabby on the palate, with an oily, bitter peach-pit flavor.",White Blend
Argentina,"This is dark, amorphous and shows almost nothing in the way of Pinot Noir character. It feels globular, tasting of beets and leather. Pruny and bitter on the finish.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Gets out of the starting blocks with spicy, brambly aromas of black cherry, red pepper flake, coconut and cassis. It feels solid and firm, with spicy, woody and dry flavors of roasted black fruit and pepper. This turns more barrel-influenced on the finish, with cinnamon and nutmeg flavors holding court. Drink now–2016.",Malbec
Argentina,"Arguably one of the best values in modern-style red wine, this blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Petit Verdot delivers huge black- and blue-fruit aromas, which lead onto the palate, with massive blackberry, black currant, cola, spice and toast flavors. This is a strapping wine to drink with steak and grilled lamb.",Red Blend
Argentina,"After the wine opens with a hit of sulfur and rubber, the bouquet turns for the better, ultimately delivering big black-fruit and cola aromas. Deep, driven and thorough in the mouth, it has earthy-berry and plum flavors that finish with notes of oaky coconut, vanilla and chocolate. Drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"Berry and rubber band are the lead aromas. The wine has texture and lasting freshness despite being more than a year old already. It's medium in size and body, with red fruit and apple skin flavors. Solid, fruity and just lively enough.",Rosé
Argentina,"On first blush it comes across entirely green and herbal. Even with airing it continues to show salad dressing, tomato and herbal aromas in addition to red fruit notes. Full and solid on the palate, with bell pepper, tobacco and roasted berry flavors. Finishes with more herbal/green hints and good structure.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Light and somewhat neutral smelling, with peach and pool water aromas. It's fresh, tangy and light on its feet, with citrus, melon and mild pithy flavors. Finishes similar, with lasting freshness, mild bitter notes and varietal correctness.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Woodsy, spicy aromas form a solid opening. There's adequate acidity on the palate along with raspberry, red plum and mild herbal notes. Racy, spicy and just toasty enough to rate well across the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lemony and strange at first, with gamy notes, leather and incense. The palate feels chunky and medicinal, with herbal, sweet, jumbled flavors of candied blackberry. Finishes flat and quick, leaving medicinal sweetness.",Malbec
Argentina,"A bit raw and hot on the nose, with wild berry aromas and some fiery horseradish before it rounds into form. The palate has a good, regular feel and crisp plum and red cherry flavors. Fruity and fresh, but limited.",Malbec
Argentina,"A really good and clean white wine with all the tropicality and zest that this Argentine variety can give. The nose is crystalline and pure, with white flower scents of jasmine and citrus blossom, while the palate is round, melony and full of lychee and papaya. Smooth on the finish. Drink soon.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Early aromas of compost and leather settle on earthy and leathery, with briar and olive. The palate is saturated and tannic, with a pretty fierce bite and flavors of roasted plum, tobacco and leather. More rough and herbal than past vintages; drink now through 2015.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Cherry, plum, bacon and licorice are all good aromas that indicate that this value wine has quality backing it up. The palate is fresh and clean, with depth and ripe, slightly oaked flavors of cassis, blackberry and chocolate. Easy to like, with toasty touches throughout.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Sweet, rich plum and spice aromas precede a juicy, ripe palate that's right in terms of feel. Blackberry, spice and light herbal flavors are nice, while the finish is chocolaty and smooth. Very nice in an average, understandable way.",Merlot
Argentina,"This wine is living proof that Argentine Malbec can and does age well. Classic in style, it has aromas of leather, tobacco, dill, vanilla and baked berry. It feels alive and kicking, with dry yet sweet berry, spice and vanilla flavors. The finish is long and not the least bit tired; drink now or continue to hold.",Malbec
Argentina,"On the nose, smoky aromas of bacon and rubber mingle with notes of toasty oak and black fruit. The palate is lively and vital, with powerful plum, berry, vanilla and butter flavors. There's a leftover butter note on the finish along with texture and length. Ripe, lush and well oaked, this is a blend of 55% Malbec and 45% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Saturated aromas of black currant and blueberry are nuanced with wood smoke, herb and mint notes. This feels ripped and tannic, but balanced, with toasty flavors of blackberry, cassis, herb and espresso. It's persistent on the finish; drink now–2015.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This is mild and lightly oaked on the front end, with peach and apple notes. It feels narrow and focused, with honeyed apple, pear and melon flavors that aren't too sweet or candied. Light and simple feeling on the finish, with elegance.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Slightly dry and scratchy on the nose, and definitely fully oaked in the Toso style. But once it settles deeper, black fruit notes escape. The palate is snappy and juicy due to 2008's cool harvest conditions, and the flavors are a mix of plum, berry and woodiness. Long and oaky on the finish; drink now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big and brooding on the nose, with blackberry, violet, coffee and mineral aromas. The palate is smooth, rich and silky, with sweet, pure, jammy black fruit flavors and a pinch of chocolaty bitterness for balance. Finishes warm and minty, with an added dusting of cocoa. Big and bold more than complex or elegant.",Syrah
Argentina,"Deep, compact and rich on the nose, with a big dose of ripe berry aromas. The palate is healthy and blends a beefy, muscular body with balancing acids and firm but ripe tannins. Tastes pretty and sweet, like blackberry or plum pie. Chewy and chocolaty on the finish; overall it's a winner.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Ripe, fruity and jammy on the nose, with smokiness and earth to go with standard berry aromas. The palate leans towards full and jammy, with sweet berry and mild spice flavors. Chunky and full-bodied, but for the most part it gets things right.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Fiery stuff with aromas that suggest cheese and leather. The mouth has a forward feel and then leafy, herbal berry flavors with sides of compost and leather. Lightly herbal on the finish, and while it's big, sweet and chunky, it doesn't click to the maximum.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smoky and leathery on the nose, with earthy blackberry aromas, tobacco and tree bark aromas. The palate runs sort of heavy, tannic and raw, with grapey flavors of black currant and roasted plum. A chunky, earthy, roasted style of Cab to drink now.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Full and warm aromas of bacon, moss and black fruits set up a round, solid palate with dark plum, berry, herb and olive flavors. Finishes more dry and savory than jammy and fruity, with a final dose of herbs.",Merlot
Argentina,"White fruit aromas are as expected and clean, with no faux oak, weight or interference. The palate is round but nicely acidic, with cutting texture and sweet, lightly creamy flavors of sweet peach, apple and butter. Turns slightly oaky late, with butterscotch and spice.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"This is a prime example that Argentine Malbec can age and improve in the bottle. It's an earthy-smelling wine, with aromas of brick dust, baked bean, molasses and dried red fruit. Smooth and classy in the mouth but still acid rich, it has integrated flavors of hard spice and berry. Drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"Jammy and raisiny on the nose, but it also has fresh black-fruit and mocha notes that prevent the nose from seeming soft. This feels concentrated and jammy, with maple, mocha, blackberry and oak-influenced flavors. The rich, oak-driven finish shows even more notes of mocha, coffee and chocolate. Candy in a glass, but with structure.",Malbec
Argentina,"Floral aromas of violets and red roses mingle with smoky notes of roasted berry, plum and leather. It's staunch and firm in the mouth, with roasted, spicy flavors of lightly roasted blackberry and plum. This finishes mossy, with a leathery accent.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"With a serious, generous opening of graphite, cassis and wild berry aromas, this Malbec is in good shape. It feels full, round and just right, with dark berry, spice and licorice flavors playing off one another. It's sweet, ripe, dense and a touch woody on the finish; drink now–2014.",Malbec
Argentina,"This smells of exotic blueberry and graham cracker, and it feels wide and solid, with herbal, woodsy flavors of juniper and plum. Dry and healthy on the finish, this made from 75% Malbec, with Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Tannat in the blend.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Begins in chunky, jammy fashion but soon it finds a classier groove. The berry aromas are big and inviting, while the palate is smooth, cushioned and deep, with standard but attractive berry and black plum flavors. Long on the finish, with the sum exceeding each part.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with heavy, gaseous aromas but once it settles down it shows much better. The palate is warm and chunky, with full berry flavors that come with a bit of earthy funk. Finishes lush and smooth, and while it's a fine Malbec, I found that it comes up short on expression.",Malbec
Argentina,"Condensed and dark on the bouquet, with initial hard, cheesy aromas giving way to herbal berry scents that suggest thyme and rosemary. The palate is soft and chubby, with just enough structure to make the earthy, ripe berry flavors taste better than simply big and bulky. Finishes with a light espresso bitterness. Drink now through 2012.",Malbec
Argentina,"Very few Argentine wines feature quality Tempranillo blended with Malbec, but that's what B Crux does and it's a major reason why I like it so much. The 2006 vintage is deep, complete and smooth, with creamy, fresh berry and mild leather aromas in front of friendly, easygoing raspberry and blackberry flavors. The oak is prominent but doesn't overwhelm. Drinking nicely right now.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Concentrated for a value-priced Malbec, with aromas of blueberry, beets and cherry. The palate is full and moderately deep, with standard black fruit flavors along with hints of butter and vanilla. Structured and balanced, with creaminess.",Malbec
Argentina,"A little hot and fiery on the nose, with jammy raspberry and pepper aromas. The palate is thick, soft and full, with savory, hickory-influenced flavors of bacon and wild berry. Big and warm on the finish; nice overall.",Bonarda
Argentina,"A unique northern Argentinean blend made from Malbec, Cabernet, Bonarda and Tannat. It's wide-bodied, with a lot of tannin and stewiness. In between, there's tobacco aromas and flavors along with tomato, roasted berry, pastiness and rootiness. A deep, tannic load that requires grilled meat or cheese.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Dry oak, pepper and wood resin are prominent on the bouquet, which also brings minty black fruit scents and finally a pinch of sawdust. The palate is boosted by firm acids and tannins, while the flavors of baked berry and black plum are driving. A lot of oak and bite here, but also plenty of dark fruit.",Bonarda
Argentina,"A gorgeous 100% Malbec with freshness, depth and complexity, this smells like graphite, cola, bacon and blackberry, then feels strapping—like granite. Smooth, deep berry flavors are matched by spice and leather, while the finish is oak driven, with coffee, coconut and chocolate notes. Drink now–2018.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cherry aromas cross over into cough drop country, while the palate is a mix of plum and berry flavors with pepper. The feel is tight, but there isn't much variety of depth. Not a bad wine, but it doesn't develop much momentum.",Merlot
Argentina,"Shows an unsual (Salta) pine and herbal nose with earth, and the flavors are a weird but not necessarily offputting blend of herbal berry fruit, savory spice, baked accents and even citrus. A fringe Cabernet for fans of Argentina.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Baked smelling, with a touch of black cherry. The palate is saucy and artificial tasting, with waves of milk chocolate, marshmallow and other sweet flavors. With carob as well as tartness to the finish, this won't stand out in the increasing crowd that is value-priced Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Jammy and loose smelling, with aromas akin to red licorice ropes. The palate is herbal and quiet tasting, but the feel is spiky due to pointed acidity. Menthol and spice accents darken the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Aromas of kirsch and raspberry jam are sweet and generally clean, while the berry palate has some roughness along with decent flavors of roasted fruits, brown sugar and spice. Turns sort of fiery at the back end.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Bramble, leather and cheese aromas crowd out the wine's fruit notes, while black cherry and plum flavors are regular. Standard mouthfeel and a mildly racy finish fail to elevate things.",Malbec
Argentina,"Safe to say that Merlot isn't Weinert's best stuff. This is brackish in color, with murky aromas of fallen leaves and baked fruit. The palate is definitely baked, thus molasses, licorice and fig paste rule. Also a bit scratchy in mouthfeel.",Merlot
Argentina,"After an initial blast of cheesy, lactic oak, the nose settles on molasses and prune. This feels saturated and tough, with a steady drumming of hard tannins bolstering sweet, dark flavors of blackberry, bitter chocolate and peppercorn. A wine that's excellent for its power, it turns a bit raisiny on the finish. Drink now.",Red Blend
Argentina,"This is prickly and spicy on first take, followed by an aromatic wave of ripe berry and tobacco. It feels jammy and almost heavy, with creamy, milkshake flavors of blackberry, vanilla and cream, and a warm, Port-like finish. A blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 20%; drink now–2014.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Smooth, subtle and ripe, this has cola, blackberry and subtle spice aromas that sit nicely in the glass. It's jammy, rich and dense on the palate, with sweet-tasting berry flavors. The finish shows spice and pastry notes. Only 500 cases were made of this blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 20% Malbec. Drink now–2015.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"This opens with attractive balsam wood and cedar aromas as well as graphite, licorice and earthy blackberry. It feels plump, lush and deep, with flavors of blackberry, black plum, balsamic and spice. Not overtly oaky, this is a fruity, balanced effort.",Malbec
Argentina,"The bouquet is loaded with sweet-smelling aromas of dark plum and blackberry. It feels intense, packed and pure in the mouth, with potent flavors of blackberry, baked plum and cassis. The finish feels mild and smooth, with a long, jammy, steady fade. A blend of 65% Malbec and 35% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Expensive Malbec, but there's no denying its quality and class. The bouquet is super smooth and silky, but also powerful. And that pretty much describes the palate: beautiful berry fruit rides a wave of richness that comes with accents of vanilla and pepper. Sexy, alluring wine with character.",Malbec
Argentina,"Another well-polished Malbec from Trapiche's single-vineyard series. This one, from Tupungato in the Uco Valley, is the most “red” of the '06s. The fruit is juicy and bursts with acidity and power. Cherry, red plum and cassis are the lead flavors, and it finishes on a bed of chocolate and peppery spice. Good now but will benefit from another year or two in bottle.",Malbec
Argentina,"Always one of Argentina's best and more fuller-bodied Torrontés. It's tropical and easy on the nose, with fleshy roundness and chunky flavors of melon and peach. Full in style, with some extra weight to the finish. Best to drink this as soon as you can, while it's fresh and lively.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Clean and full for starters, with big berry aromas and hints of freshly poured tar as well as minerality. The palate is pure and hits the nail on the head in terms of feel. Flavors of blackberry and plum are dark and generous. Finishes with pepper, espresso and chocolate. Very good wine for the price.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Big, dark and masculine, with minty, chocolaty, robust aromas and plenty of residual oak. Calling this wine a “load” is an understatment; it's massive, with flavors of blackberry, gumball, cassis, pepper and mint. Finishes that way, too. A brawny wine that's in its prime. Drink now through 2013.",Syrah-Malbec
Argentina,"A rock-solid Malbec with attractive yet simple aromas of black cherry and raspberry. The palate is juicy and fresh, but with enough body to provide a sense of richnes. Forward tasting, with pure berry flavors and a hint of chocolate. The perfect wine for pizza, pasta or grilled meats.",Malbec
Argentina,"Full, fresh and bright Malbec with only the good stuff that has made this variety so popular. The color is lusty, the aromas fruity and clean, and the feel is forward with proper body and acids. Tastes like pure wild raspberry and black cherry, with hints of vanilla and oak. Appealing in every way.",Malbec
Argentina,"Intense and extracted but also well balanced and smooth, with minerality and asphalt on the nose. The palate mixes deep black fruit weight and flavors with snappy acids, and overall this is bright, bullish and full of berry and black cherry along with chocolate. A ripe, satisfying wine for the money.",Bonarda
Argentina,"It's not often that you get the chance to try an aged Malbec for this price. The nose is sweet but also a bit soupy, while the palate is lively and delivering mature flavors of stewed cherry, cassis and raisin. Long on the finish, with brown sugar notes. A wine with finesse and restraint to drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is opaque, offering a lush collection of black fruit aromas on what amounts to a deep, dense bouquet. Layered and displaying excellent size and texture, it has saturated, meaty black-fruit flavors along with toasty, integrated oak. A powerhouse Malbec and maybe the best Ultra to date.",Malbec
Argentina,"The nose offers berry and black plum aromas that come across clean and proper. The palate is lush, juicy and good in feel, with thicker, more ripe flavors of warm plum and blackberry. Reaches almost dessert-level sweetness on the finish, cementing its status as a rich and ripe Malbec with moderate structure.",Malbec
Argentina,"Black and charred at first, with licorice, asphalt and a touch of bacon on the bouquet. The palate is soft, soupy and round, with ripe, saturated berry and fig flavors. Finishes spicy and full, with chewy tannins and ample extract.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fresh, layered aromas of black fruits and licorice are appealing. The palate is full and offers kick, while flavors of berry and plum are fairly rich, spicy and honest for $9 Cabernet. A bit sticky and it falls off on the finish, but overall it's a nice value red.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Sweet, jammy aromas of black currant and blue fruit go straight to the flavor profile, which conists of candied berry, cassis and brown sugar. A little cloying and grabby, with some heat to the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Rubbery and murky on the nose, with acid-propelled red-fruit flavors that are at once generic but also sharp-edged. Throughout this it's an angular wine with boldness but not much levity. Can't see it capturing much of a crowd at $30.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This is concentrated and pure, with focused boysenberry, subtle oak and graham cracker aromas. It feels serious and saturated, with a tight set of berry and vanilla flavors. Narrow, linear and precise on the finish; drink now–2014.",Malbec
Argentina,"Despite having tons of oaky aromas of coconut and vanilla, it's delicious, balanced and rich, with a graphite element. The full but smooth tannins carry the thick berry and plum flavors, which help absorb the generous oak like a sponge. Drink now–2016.",Malbec
Argentina,"Bright and bold to the eye, this has generous, powerful berry aromas that come with a note of spice. It feels stacked and only slightly tangy, with black fruit and some of Syrah's more textbook flavors of leather and animal. It holds form on the finish.",Syrah
Argentina,"There's no drop-off in this wine from the excellent 2005. Expect blackberry, cassis and dry balsam wood/cedar aromas. The palate is lush and chewy, but also vital and lively. Toasty, dark berry flavors get a softening of vanilla on the finish. A winner to drink now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"Coconut and inky black fruit melt into an ultrarich and layered bouquet, and that's the perfect entree to the wine's sweet, broad, chocolaty black fruit flavors that come with a cool mint accent. Boiled down this is nothing more than a concentrated, bold Malbec that's sweet, tasty and uncomplicated. Drink now through 2011.",Malbec
Argentina,"Among full-bodied, old-vines Malbec, this is an unbridled winner. The nose is rooty and sweet, but also inky and dark. And the palate is totally pure, with snappy tannins, fine acidity and loads of black fruit flavor mixed with tobacco and coconut. Racy, juicy and delicious as it enters its prime. Drink now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"With its tropical melony aromas and crisp palate, this comes across as rock-solid Torrontés. It's tight and tastes of lime and pineapple. There's an exactness to this wine, sort of like savoring a perfect lime. Not complicated but very satisfying; drink immediately for maximum freshness.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Sweet up front, with a heaping of wood spice on top of raisin and baked berry aromas. This is a big, full-bodied mature wine with tannins that are still grabbing and flavors of roasted blackberry, dark plum and ingrained spice. Finishes long, toasty and sweet, with some heat and a distinct baked quality. Drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"A superripe style of Malbec blended with Cabernet. It's dark as midnight, with a lush bouquet and palate that ooze bulky black fruit aromas and flavors. It's compact, dense and sweet as sin, with black fruit marmalade and chocolate running the flavor profile. Finishes syrupy and with café mocha flavors. Flavorful to the max but a bit too soft to be considered excellent.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Lusty, deep Malbec from Patagonia. The nose is a puddle of rich berry, spice and chocolate, while the palate is snappy and alert even if the flavors veer toward roasted black fruits, sweetness, cola and sautéed mushroom. A bit tannic and biting on the finish, with earth and oak standing out.",Malbec
Argentina,"This high-class blend of Malbec and Cabernet Franc is both elegant and powerful. The bouquet deals classic Malbec aromas of cola, licorice and blackberry, while the palate features typical Cabernet Franc spice, along with a ripe, healthy blackberry flavor. Expansive and buttery smooth on the finish, this should be opened now–2016.",Malbec-Cabernet Franc
Argentina,"Sweet black plum, licorice and anise aromas are soft yet nice. The palate, however, is more clacky, with jammy, reduced flavors of syrupy berry and sappy tannins. Jammy and saturated on the finish as well; tons of berry and size, but not perfectly balanced.",Malbec
Argentina,"Light and airy to start, with peach and other white fruit aromas. The palate has good feel and lift along with nectarine, melon and mango flavors. Blends tropicality along with creaminess and crispness. Nice for the variety.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Jammy berry and plum aromas offer vanilla on the side. The palate is juicy, fresh and full, while the flavors suggest roasted berry, a light leafy quality and herbs. Healthy, stout and peppery/spicy on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"This wine may be darker and oakier than Maipu's regular '07 Malbec, but it isn't substantially better. It has heavy black-fruit aromas and a sweet, clammy palate of jammy blackberry. Caramel and chocolate flavors make the finish thick and sweet.",Malbec
Argentina,"Generic, superficial and hard, but still with plenty of color and firepower. Feelwise, it's a narrow wine without much cushion or stuffing to fall back on. Flavors of raspberry and plum are also leafy and mildly stemmy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dusty red in color, with light cherry aromas. The palate is stretched and short on pulse, while the flavors of strawberry and red plum are basic and sort of grabby. Not as cleansing and fresh as it could be.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is full and solid, with blackberry, boysenberry and toasty aromas. It feels smooth and lush, with plump blackberry fruit and a flavor of roasted, smoky oak. The finish is mellow, with medium intensity. Drink now and over the next two years.",Malbec
Argentina,"The waxy, dusty aromas of apple are calm and regular. It feels a bit flat, with oaky flavors of apple, melon, vanilla and resin. The finish feels resiny too, but overall it's good in a regular, popular style.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Quite good and honest, with full raspberry, cherry and tea aromas along with a hint of grassiness. The palate is dark and full-bodied, with toasty cherry and herbal tea flavors. Finishes long, full and several steps ahead of most of the competition. Drink now.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Rubbery and heady on first blush, with gaseous, leathery aromas that initially cloud the wine's fruit components. With time it evolves, showing dark cherry, raspberry and leathery flavors in front of an herbal, persistent finish. A little choppy and inconsistent but still a very good Malbec from a tough vintage.",Malbec
Argentina,"A big step up from the prior year; the bouquet is spicy, dry, minerally and offers attractive dried flower aromas. The mouthfeel is pure, easygoing and slightly creamy, while the flavors suggest dried raspberry, plum and vanilla for sweetness. Toasty and dry on the finish; elegant for Argentinean PN.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"This new wine from importer Bart Broadbent offers cherry, raspberry and plum aromas along with a touch of well-applied oak. It's a little tannic and biting in the mouth, but with food that should be no issue. Flavorwise, it's dealing slightly burnt notes atop full-fledged black cherry and wild berry. A firm, edgy wine with many good qualities.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark purple in color, with blackberry and spice on a potent bouquet. The palate is ripe and pure, with rich dark fruit flavors and oak-driven chocolate notes. Finishes full, toasty, peppery and smooth. Very nice and sturdy Malbec for everyday drinking.",Malbec
Argentina,"Baked and compact on the nose, which is dark, rubbery and offers hints of smoked meats. The palate has a rich, layered feel and robust flavors of baked black fruits, molasses, caramel and toast. It's warm, full and shows Old World notes of tobacco and toffee. Drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"Deep and juicy Malbec with aromas of violets, blackberry, coconut shavings and mineral. There's also a cedary element to the nose and palate. Otherwise, look for full-force wild berry and cassis flavors and a smooth, clean finish. Nothing awkward or forced; Doña Paula's best Malbec ever. Drink now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opaque purple and thick in the glass, this wine has inky, supercharged aromas of ripe blackberry and spice. It feels amped up but balanced, with more intensity and clarity than what most other $18 reds offer. The flavors of wild berry, mild herb and chocolate finish in a rich, toasty wrapping.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dusty, big and leathery on the nose, with coconut and earthy berry fruit aromas. The palate on this Cabernet-led blend is lively and juicy, with staunch acids and savory, earthy flavors of cherry and raspberry along with spice. Oaky and a little heavy, but offset by snappy acidity.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Dark, smoky and minty on the nose, with mocha and licorice in the backdrop. The palate is fleshy and full but also oaky and lactic, with creamy flavors of chocolate, syrupy berry fruit and vanilla. Finishes with salty notes, which go against most of the wine's creamy, oaky influences. One-third each of Cabernet, Malbec and Merlot.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Opens with earthy, leafy aromas that can best be described as “mature.” Throw in tobacco and baked plum, and the picture is complete. The palate is concentrated and tight, with sweet, herbal berry flavors and caramel on the finish. Rugged and herbal as a whole but with good qualities; 50% Cabernet with 40% Merlot and 10% Malbec.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Candied and a bit stemmy on the nose, with sweet cherry flavors that carry a slight weedy, herbal accent. The palate is medium in weight, with a creamy, mildly grassy finish of milk chocolate and raspberry.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dilute cherry aromas carry an alcoholic burn, while the palate is candied, generic and semisweet. Finishes hot, with not much of a pleasure quotient.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Cheese and crackers on the nose, meaning it's not all that fruity and clean. In the mouth, it's also bisquits and cheddar city. And the feel is round and foamy, with a dry, chalky finish that erases much of what came prior. One can only say this bubbly has its issues.",Champagne Blend
Argentina,"The yellow color and oversized punchbowl aromas tell you all you need to know: that this is a wide load with an aggressive, fat nose and a chunky but fragile palate. Unctuous flavors of banana and lemon are forced, while the mouthfeel is unstable. Won't last for much longer.",Torrontés
Argentina,"The earthy-berry and prune aromas are rich, with a hint of juniper and green herbs. It feels full, with medium acidity blending nicely with the creamy oak. Big, lush and generous, the palate bears black fruit and vanilla flavors, and the finish is a touch pruny.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is one of Walter Bressia's better wines under his Monteagrelo label. It opens with spicy, peppery aromas that include cherry and berry scents. The palate is tannic, with cassis, plum, basil, oregano and spice flavors. This finishes long, with notes of coffee and chocolate entering the picture.",Cabernet Franc
Argentina,"Spicy on the nose, with berry and plum aromas. The palate is smooth and sturdy, with toasty, ripe black-fruit flavors that carry a sweet, spicy base. It finishes long and serious.",Malbec
Argentina,"A warm and generous Malbec, this has aromas of melted rubber and berry. It's full, grabby and correct in the mouth, with lightly herbal flavors of plum, berry and chocolate. The finish is big, juicy and toasty.",Malbec

Argentina,"Intense aromas of lead pencil, cola, cedar and blackberry are complete. The palate feels lush and smooth but weighty, with sweet, ripe berry fruits and well-applied notes of toasty oak, vanilla, cola and tobacco. The finish is warm, smooth and mocha laden. Drink now–2014.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is smooth smelling, like a blend of raspberry, plum and spice. The palate feels ripped and layered, not lazy or heavy, with red berry, cassis, plum and caramel flavors. It's long, sweet and chocolaty on the finish, with roasted, savory notes.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"The hazy aromas of honeyed white fruits are a touch gaseous. It feels plump and nice, with soft, almost flat melon flavors. It tastes similar on the finish, showing little evolution from the palate.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Toasty, oaky and a bit lemony on the nose, this has baked apple notes that are friendly. It feels round and honeyed, with toasty, candied flavors that veer toward pear, apple and honey. Resin and cinnamon flavors work the soft, sweet-tasting finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Opens with mildly baked aromas but there's enough fresh fruit, fine herbs and lavender to make it inviting. The palate is narrow and tight but clean and lively, with herbal berry flavors and plenty of power. Finishes long but lean, with cleansing acids. Will go well with an array of foods.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"Earthy, rich and dry to begin with, and also a tiny bit herbal. The palate is firm, slightly rough and tannic, but as a whole this is a very tasty wine with bold black cherry and blackberry flavors. Finishes quick and easy, and overall it's likable and further proof that Bonarda from Mendoza can complement Malbec.",Bonarda
Argentina,"A very rich and soft wine made from hand-squeezed Malbec grapes. There's a ton of oak on it, which comes out as coconut and cream on the nose. The palate is also creamy, with mocha, sweet blackberry and fudge flavors. Cola, coconut, coffee and other hedonistic, dark, masculine accents make this a fun and interesting wine to drink now. Best on its own or with meat.",Malbec
Argentina,"Here's a full-of-dynamite, small-batch Malbec that smells of bold berry fruit mixed with earth, smoked meats and mocha. The flavor set is pure, driving blackberry with mild herbal accents, and the finish is long, flavorful and lightly herbal. Expensive and a little fiery, but still excellent. Drink now through 2013. Only 250 cases made.",Malbec
Argentina,"Spicy, hard aromas blend with pasty black fruit scents. The palate is big and lively, with baked flavors of blackberry and dark plum. Turns tight on the finish, which is crisp and tannic. Good Bonarda and a food-friendly wine.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Starts out with some heaviness and aromas of fresh cement and lacquer. With airing it improves, revealing a high-acid, fresh palate with raspberry, saline and herbal flavors. Roasted and firm on the finish, with a bit of excess heat.",Malbec
Argentina,"Roasted at first, with smoked ham and bacon aromas along with clove and other hard spice notes. The palate is oaky, with chewy tannins and a thick texture; flavors of blackberry are meaty and rich, while clove and more dry spices reappear on the finish. A different breed for Mendoza.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Perfumed, floral aromas lead to a juicy, slightly lean palate with berry and plum flavors. Plump and sturdy, with lifting acids and a secure body. Nothing spectacular but at least it's not heavy and grinding like Bonarda can be.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Coconut is apparent on the bouquet along with thick blackberry aromas. The palate is big and saturated but also simple and bulky. Flavors of baked blackberry are candied, while the finish is figgy and chubby.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is a rich, plush Cabernet, with a sense of elegance. It smells like prune, blackberry, coffee and toast. The concentrated palate boasts prune, olive, coffee and dark berry flavors. Drink or hold for a few years.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"No other way to call it: this is pretty weak Pinot. The nose is hot, dry and offers mostly fiery cherry, while the palate is thin and tastes of bitter cherry. Evaporates fast on the finish.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"A black fruit aroma is the basis of the attractive bouquet. On the palate there are notes of black plum and prune, with plenty of oak influence. It finishes sweet, dark and chocolaty. Drink now–2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dry berry and balsam wood aromas are subdued and attractive. This feels slightly acidic, with a tomatoey feel to the hard-coated palate. It delivers pointed red-plum and wild-berry flavors, with a dash of spice. Drink now–2015.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dense and leathery on the nose, this has aromas of briary berries and a hint of corn/masa. It feels round and textured, with healthy tannins and chewy flavors of blackberry, roasted beef and herb. The medium-long finish turns a touch more herbal and complex.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rustic and leathery smelling, the nose has hints of bell pepper, jalapeño and tomato. It feels mildly astringent but has good structure. The flavors of dried red fruit, tobacco, herb and sweet spice are mature and classic, and the finish has a good feel. This is a blend of 40% Malbec, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Merlot. Drink now.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Toasty aromas of wood shavings, menthol, cola and blackberry compose the nose. This is flush and wide on the palate, with blackberry, coffee, chocolate, toast and molasses flavors. It feels a little soft, so drink now.",Petit Verdot
Argentina,"Crisp and clean, with lemon-lime and lychee aromas that are typical and well presented. There's body to the wine but also streamlining acidity, resulting in a slick, smooth mouthfeel. Flavors of green melon, citrus and lychee are fresh and positive.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Fairly large, dark and extracted, but also lush and rich, with aromas of raisin and stewed blackberry. The palate is rich to the point of almost being heavy, while the flavors of blackberry and roasted black plum are mildly leathery and salty. Nice, big, meaty and tasty for the price.",Syrah
Argentina,"Cherry, sweet berry and citrus peel aromas come in front of a full, slightly oaky palate with sweet plum and berry flavors. There's some length to the finish and more flavors of sweet, creamy but nicely applied oak.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Earthy and a bit foresty on the nose, with a leather accent to the berry aromas. Full and reasonably sound across the palate, which offers baked berry and coffee flavors in front of a modest, leathery finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Spicy dark fruit aromas include notes of tobacco and mint along with mustard and/or horseradish. The palate is big and tannic, with a rough feel showcasing round, chunky berry and cassis flavors. Stays rough and tannic on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Solid, familiar berry and plum aromas carry some sweetness and vanilla. The palate, however, is fairly acidic and tight, with a piercing center and snappy, almost tart flavors of raspberry and red plum. Crisp and sheering on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cherry and mild leather aromas are inviting, while the medium-bodied palate, despite having some bite and edge, is topped off with cassis, cherry and light medicinal flavors. A bright wine with lively acidity and touches of oak, butter and vanilla on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Exotic smelling, with Middle Eastern spice aromas, blueberry and herbs. Highly acidic and spiky in the mouth, with cassis and blackberry flavors in front of an aggressive finish that smolders with heat. Dense but awkward, with forceful acidity.",Petit Verdot
Argentina,"Dilute and gritty, with cleanliness issues. The palate is thin, scratchy and tastes like brambly berry fruit mixed with clay. And it finishes with tomato notes and a dull scour.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Melony and mealy, with heavy, flat flavors of peach pits and apple cider. Flat feeling as well, with barely a pulse to the finish. Past its prime and fading faster than a comet.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Aromas of stemmy, sweaty raspberry and strawberry lead to a raw, hot palate of bulky, salty flavors. Nothing much going on.",Malbec
Argentina,"With the right mix of ripeness and varietal spiciness, this is fruity, dense and earthy, with pepper and herb hints. The palate is full and feels proper, offering flavors of baked berry, chocolate, toast and coffee. Moderately complex, the finish is long and healthy.",Cabernet Sauvignon

Argentina,"Superdense, jammy, extracted and dark, this has aromas of graphite, cola and sweet pastry along with a note of black fruit preserve.

A blend of 70% Malbec and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Smoke, leather and game aromas mix with blackberry, while the palate is juicy, with plenty of crispness. Like many A-F wines, Quimera, a blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot, is tangy and lively. Flavors of red currants and cherry have a high-toned personality, and the finish is bold. Drink now through 2014.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Hits the stage with lemon-lime, melon and flowery aromas that are followed by a crisp mouth with jousting acids, lime and tangerine flavors, and finally a crystal-clear finish with zest and length. Very nice for this variety; drink right away.",Torrontés
Argentina,"The wine has a dark, crusty top to the nose, with solid berry aromas under that. The palate is bright, zesty and features familiar plum and black cherry flavors. And the finish is straightforward but smooth. Stylish, with a little snap, crackle and pop.",Malbec
Argentina,"A big, full-bodied Malbec with charm. The nose is toasty, with black fruit, chocolate and other stocky, earthy aromas. Saturated in the mouth, with concentrated black fruit flavors. Shows touches of mint and spice on the finish along with coffee, licorice and chocolate. Drink now through 2012.",Malbec
Argentina,"Inky, dark, charred and serious, and it only gets better as it opens with air. The palate has a smooth, deep, comfortable feel and the flavors are sweet, fruity, creamy and proper for Malbec. Chocolaty and rich on the finish. A very nice wine made for near-term drinking.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tropical aromas of lychee and melon are bright but a little oily. The palate is round and honest in feel and acidity, with pineapple, lemon, tangerine and lychee flavors. Sweet and spunky on the finish; drink immediately.",Torrontés
Argentina,"A bit warm and baked on the nose, with aromas of fruit cake and pastry. The palate is full-bodied and chewy, with ripe, sweet black fruit flavors that finish with vanilla and chocolate.",Malbec-Tempranillo
Argentina,"Seems like quality and character are slipping a bit on this Malbec, which a few years ago overdelivered but is now more average. Red licorice, strawberry and sweetness characterize the nose. The palate is sweet and generic, while the finish is pretty much the same. Perfectly good but not the gem it used to be.",Malbec
Argentina,"A thick, dark and slightly raisiny nose features licorice and smoke. It's a full, beefy Malbec with herbal berry flavors and a finish that sweetens up like syrup but also gets more herbal. Powerful but more rustic than polished.",Malbec
Argentina,"Blackberry and other sweet aromas lead to a soft, mildly oaky palate with sweet, ripe plum and berry flavors. There's juicy acids and reasonable amounts of toast, licorice and spice on the finish. Not sure what differentiates this from Reserve, but the Barrel Select seems better balanced.",Merlot
Argentina,"Ripe and clean smelling, with berry fruit aromas and a pinch of spice. The palate is medium-bodied and just dense enough, with dark, slightly roasted flavors of blackberry and plum. Fresh and tight; covers the basics.",Malbec
Argentina,"Minty and toasty upfront, this is layered with blackberry, licorice, leather and toast aromas. It feels raring and ready to go, courtesy of firm acidity and good overall framing. Flavors of wild berry are bright, with herb and oak accents. Long, toasty and solid on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Light, clean aromas of melon and vanilla are pleasant and don't overpower. The palate is lucid and medium in weight, with green melon and ripe apple flavors. Lime and green apple carry the finish. Works well; drink immediately.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Scratchy raspberry aromas lend some harshness to the bouquet, but that's replaced soon after by earthy berry fruit notes. The palate is plump and full, with chunky, thick flavors of black fruit that are nice but quiet. Fruity, jammy and easygoing throughout. Drink now into 2012.",Malbec
Argentina,"A bit fleshy and melony on the nose, and also flowery. The palate has a full feel despite present acids, and the apple and citrus palate is clean and slightly green. Shows all the basics on a sweet, soft frame.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Smells good, with berry- dominated aromas. The palate is solid but acidic at the core, with sharpness on the palate that creates a juicy, crisp set of raspberry and plum flavors. Flattens out on the finish, where moderate oak-based butter notes rise up.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Giant and black, with extracted but pruney aromas that are sweet and raisiny. The palate is chunky, with raisin, fig and black plum flavors. Sweet but falls flat on the finish; has its good qualities but frankly it's an overripe wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"So ripe it's edging toward raisiny, with plum, nutmeg, charcoal and licorice notes. Jammy, soft and borderline syrupy on the palate, this has saturated flavors of black fruit, burnt caramel and mushroom. This is toasty on the finish but without much grip or edge. Drink now–2014.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lemony oak and wood shavings are the initial aromas, and with time the nose transitions to vanilla and mocha notes. It feels jammy and saturated, with thick berry flavors bolstered by hints of creamy oak and spice. It turns more oaky on the finish, with cinnamon and resin tones taking over.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark, earthy and smoky up front, this has notes of cola, lead pencil and moss that are distinct to Cafayate. Full in feel, this has high acidity, with flavors of mossy, herbal black fruits. Bold, earthy and individual in character.",Malbec
Argentina,"Initial tar and asphalt aromas yield to grapy berry and earth notes. It feels hard but not real deep, with a short wild-berry flavor that leads to a reasonably good but superficial finish. Juicy and fresh.",Shiraz
Argentina,"Quite bright, sweet and fruity, with a hint of cherry candy and blackberry on the bouquet and then a juicy, fresh palate with mild chocolate, raspberry and proper texture. For $11 this wine is more than competent; it's very good. 50,000 cases made.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with blackberry aromas, earth and spice notes. There's a shock of core acidity to the palate that keeps the wine fresh and balanced. Flavors of black cherry and black currant are jammy and on the sweet side, and the finish has a cookie dough quality along with lasting sweetness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Bright, fresh and floral, with lively berry, briar and fresh mint aromas. The palate is high-toned and crisp, with elevated acidity adding snap to the boysenberry and blackberry flavors. Juicy and clean, but a little sharp and angular.",Malbec
Argentina,"Floral on the nose, with reduced, dark aromas that suggest campfire and/or shoe polish. The palate has firm tannins and lots of extract, while the flavors of blackberry are both ripe and floral. Finishes spicy and dark, with coffee, licorice and anise flavors. More spicy than pure and fruity.",Malbec
Argentina,"A lot of olive and leather give this wine's nose a “green” personality that suggests lightly cured tobacco and fresh herbs. The palate is big and grabby, with herbal, roasted berry flavors along with coffee and spice notes. Layered but firm on the finish, with a lasting tannic bite. 75% Cabernet with 25% Malbec.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"Rubbery and warm on the nose, with earthy plum and blackberry aromas. The palate is full and bouncy, with appropriate plum, berry and cassis flavors. Nice for standard New World Cab, with fig, chocolate and no buttery, sloppy oak.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Meaty, herbal aromas are a bit rooty and mossy but with time they offer up berry fruit and spice. The palate is full and plump, and also a little hard and tannic, while the flavors suggest prune and cassis. Spicy and with good feel to the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Much better than prior vintages, when it was known as Finca El Portillo. The nose is jammy and shows black fruit aromas, while the palate is complete and full but juicy, with plum and black cherry flavors. Pepper and toast flavors infiltrate the finish.",Merlot
Argentina,"Raspberry, plum and subtle oak aromas lead to a snappy, crisp, high-acid palate with pie cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. There isn't much finish or extras here; basic and well cut.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"An intimidating wine in that it's dark, huge and heavy. The nose is a roasted mass of tar, rubber, smoke and baked berry fruit. It's thick and fleshy in the mouth, with flavors of cola, chocolate, blackberry and blueberry. Minty and warm late, and overall it's more about color and size than refinement.",Malbec
Argentina,"Like the winery's Gran Reserva '08, this is a saturated bomber that rides along the edge of overripeness. Aromas of baked berry, cassis, vanilla and coconut are rich and oaky. It feels tannic, with a beam of shrill acidity that props up flavors that otherwise might seem raisiny or pruney. Chocolate and wood resin tones pile up on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"This opens with a breeze of air freshener, tropical oils, green fruits and apricots. Fresh and crisp in feel, it has mild green-fruit flavors that are led by notes of lime and lychee. The finish is creamy, tropical and slightly bitter.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Much better than the 2009, this Malbec opens with menthol, leather and herb aromas along with notes of berries. It feels deep, with a medium body and sweet, friendly, flavors of blackberry, brown sugar and chocolate. The finish tastes slightly candied.",Malbec
Argentina,"Untamed and herbal on the bouquet, this has a coconutty sweetness that's offset by scratchy berry and grassy notes. It feels firm, with high acidity and tight tannins; the herbal flavors mingle with notes of sweet cassis and baked berry.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A consistent Torrontés, with tropical and exotic aromas of green melon, lychee and bath oil. It feels round despite sporting nice acids, while flavors of green apple, lychee, melon and cardamom work well in front of a long, sweet, pithy finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Dusty and warm up front, this has baked apple and peachy aromas. It feels round with only mild acidity, while the flavors yield barrel resin, citrus and sweet melon. It's not too evolved on the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Opens in hard fashion, with horseradish and additional bitter aromas eventually yielding to boysenberry and blackberry. The palate is chewy and comes with firm tannins, and the flavors are a standard but nice mix of black fruits and mocha. Short and sturdy on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Bold Malbec with aromas of berry liqueur, cassis and black cherry. The palate is fresh in feel, with some edginess and snappy acids. Tastes full of berry fruit, creamy oak and vanilla, while the finish is round, lengthy and big. A little oaky and forced, but nice as Malbec goes.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lychee and lime are the lead aromas on this good Torrontés from Salta. The palate shows bright, piercing acids and a narrow, citrus profile; flavors of orange and grapefruit follow suit. Citrusy on the finish, with ample roundness.",Torrontés
Argentina,"For the price you can't go wrong with a wine like this. It's flowery and fruity, and beyond that it doesn't pretend to be more than it is. There's a natural creaminess to the feel and full melon and white fruit flavors. Proof that some Chardonnays do better without oak.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Nice, clean and friendly, which is about 99% of the game for this variety. Aromas of flowers, lychee and vanilla bean are welcoming, while the palate is fresh and standard, with lemon-lime and citrusy flavors. A refreshing white to drink as soon as possible.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Chunky, stout and solid on the nose, with round, pure flavors of black cherry and raspberry. The mouthfeel is comfortable and complete, especially for an $11 wine from Argentina. Finishes dry, smooth and slightly spicy; very pleasing in a no-nonsense way.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dry and lightly balsamic on the nose, with solid fruit aromas that show a marginal level of stem. The palate is stacked with black cherry and blueberry along with full tannins. The finish, however, is surprisingly silky, with chocolate and coconut flavors. A deep, nice, layered wine that has a lot going for it.",Malbec
Argentina,"A three-grape blend of Cab Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Merlot. The nose is rich and mossy, with vanilla and baked fruit aromas. It's big and tannic on the palate, and thus the sweet, semi-baked flavors of black fruit are appropriate. Sticky and tasting of brown sugar on the finish. Rich but good, especially with grilled beef.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Opening with subtle berry aromas and hints of herb, rubber and leather, this is sturdy as a rock, with dry, spicy plum and cassis flavors. Powerful but restrained, it's neither overextracted nor too grapy.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Neutral on the nose except for some oak and floral notes. The palate is fleshy and a bit hollow in feel, with peach and sweet, almost sugary melon and pineapple flavors. Finishes like a melon ball, but at least the mouthfeel is good and not flabby.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Sweet berry aromas are a bit warm and herbal, while the palate has good feel and soft, earthy flavors of herbs and generic berry fruit. Light on the finish, with a slight leafy note. Has good mouthfeel and doesn't overdo it.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark, smoky aromas suggest prune, licorice, coconut and shoe polish. The palate is sharper than the color would indicate, while flavors of dark berry, licorice and plum vie with oak then bitterness. Pinched and tangy at points, but balanced by oaky softness. 65% Malbec with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Light and red in style, with food-friendly acidity and good overall balance and presence. Has sheer qualities and crisp fruit flavors, but it's not sour or too edgy. Smells like Pinot and tastes like it, too.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Light and airy, with almost neutral aromas except for some lemon. The palate is round and offers good acids that propel green apple and lime flavors. A basic wine with light aromatics and proper flavors.",Torrontés
Argentina,"This opens with a whiff of green and clam shell but quickly transitions to black plum and berry scents. Tannic and rugged on the palate, it has a mix of blackberry, chocolate and herbal flavors. The finish is firm, with length and more than enough power.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Full berry aromas are accented by notes of cumin, cola and grilled meat. This feels full-bodied but not overly heavy, with a mellow berry flavor and dark notes of chocolate and meat. The finish is smooth and oaky, with a touch of graphite.",Malbec
Argentina,"A very good, heavily oaked Malbec that exudes clove and hickory notes before settling on aromas of earthy fruit and cheesy leather. The palate feels flush and tannic, with accents of clove and cumin and a secondary berry flavor. It ends with touches of barrel spice and resin.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fleshy and aggressive on the bouquet, this has aromas of wild berries, with leather and dried cheese accents. It feels full and weighty, with sweet, almost-stewy flavors of blackberry and plum, and supporting notes of vanilla and spice. This finishes a bit rubberry.",Malbec
Argentina,"This opens with quality berry and cassis aromas. It feels crisp, focused and fresh on the palate, with restrained plum, black cherry and oaky-vanilla flavors. Steady and medium-long on the finish, this has controlled intensity and a touch of rusticity typical of Salta.",Malbec
Argentina,"Bold, aggressive and fiery on the nose, but also loaded with berry and cherry aromas that are spunky and inviting. The palate has a pulpy, grapey feel that is apropos for the wine's solid plum and berry flavors. Slightly herbal on the finish courtesy of the Cab in this 50/50 blend. Good stuff for everyday usage.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Opens with spicy, almost smoky dark fruit aromas, which are followed by a healthy palate with freshness, good berry flavors and a touch of creamy oak that leans toward vanilla and lacticity. Good all around, with depth and a solid mouthfeel. Nice wine for the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"Hefty and fruity, with depth to the black fruit nose. The palate is a bit sticky and tannic, but it's ripe and driving, with wild raspberry, black plum, tea and spice flavors. Finishes a hint herbal, but on the plus side the wine isn't overextracted or too jammy and sweet.",Shiraz
Argentina,"Strong and extracted, and needing a few minutes to settle. The palate is concentrated, dark and chewy, with ripe berry flavors that hint at being medicinal and raisiny but don't fully go there. While this is nothing earth-shattering, for $12 it's complete and should offer mass appeal.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Earthy, spicy and rich on the nose, but then quite gritty, tough and tannic on the palate. Flavors of black cherry and dark plum are thick and sweet, while the finish rests on roasted, dark berry fruit. Solid as a rock, warm, baked and sweet.",Red Blend
Argentina,"There's plenty of size, sweetness and fruit on the nose. It feels rich and ripe, with an exemplary weight-to-acid ratio, and it tastes juicy, fruity and friendly, with notes of black licorice and dark chocolate on the finish. A wine that properly blends Malbec's sweet and sultry sides.",Malbec
Argentina,"Thick and chewy, this Cabernet is all Argentine in its weight and character. It feels full, with candied, creamy dark-fruit flavors that are backed by caramel and spice notes. The wine is hugely flavorful and expansive on the finish, showing brown-sugar sweetness and toasty warmth. Drink now–2017.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Citrus blossom and tropical aromas are light and easy. The palate is melony and not too acidic, with standard Asian pear, lychee and citrus flavors. Lively on the finish, and solid overall for under $10.",Torrontés
Argentina,"A little savory on the nose, with medicinal red berry aromas. The palate is medium in intensity and regular in feel, with earthy, herbal flavors of cherry and raspberry. Shows a meaty hint on a short, average finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Syrupy smelling on first take, with bacon, rubber and herb aromas. The palate has a healthy, full feel and a mixed bag of not fully connected flavors including herbs, spice, dried fennel and sweet berry fruits. A somewhat odd tasting blend of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon and 45% Merlot.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
Argentina,"Reduced and limited up front, with grassy, sweet aromas of sweet plum and berry. The palate is big but muddled by soft, full-bodied flavors of beets, licorice and sweet fruits. Shows some green on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Brambly and leafy on the nose and palate, with tight acidity and reedy, peppery flavors that suggest foresty raspberry. The finish is equally peppery, herbal and leafy, but overall it's not green or unappealing. A natural wine in that it's unoaked.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dense aromas of berries come with graphite and peppery scents, with notes of wood smoke and grilled meat. This feels full and a touch rough and rugged, with raspberry and plum flavors matched by herbal and burnt accents. It's forward and toasted on the finish, with coffee, herb and animal notes. Contains 15% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Malbec
Argentina,"A new wine from Chile's Veramonte, this starts with huge cola and blackberry aromas. which are backed by grippy tannins and mild astringency. It tastes bulky, bearing grippy tannins and mild astringency, with leather and blackberry notes. Coffee and spice flavors control the finish on this ripe Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Earth and rubber notes on the bouquet give way to black fruit and black olive aromas. It feels fresh, with a good acid level and a solid body supporting flavors of wild berry, plum and spice. The finish is toasty, with a fair amount of oak and bacon flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"Minty, chocolaty and oaky on the first, second and third takes. The palate is full and rich, with toasty, resiny flavors supporting big berry fruit notes and chocolate. Finishes dry and with another wave of toasty wood character. Overly woody but also ripe and healthy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Warm and a touch sweet smelling, with dried spices, brown sugar and roasted plum on the nose. The palate is chunky, a touch viscous and slightly woody, but it also brings full plum and berry flavors along with peppery spice. Finishes with solid cherry at the core and then more spice and pepper.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"A chunky, deep-fruited Malbec that is all about blackberry fruit. There's no funk or odd, floral, overcropped aromas here; instead, it's focused on roasted blackberry flavors, a natural herbal character, and coffee and mocha on the finish. Emphasizes size and friendliness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smoky and floral on the nose, and then thick and ripe in the mouth, with syrup to go with medicinal berry flavors. It's chewy and dense, with chocolate, cream and vanilla to the finish. A bit plodding, but its full weight, feel and depth of fruit push it along.",Malbec
Argentina,"A blend of charred oak and violets lead the bouquet, which also offers some floral berry. The palate is lifted, medium-weight and juicy, with boysenberry and cherry flavors. Very nice if you like a floral Malbec with bright berry fruit as opposed to something dark, meaty and oaky.",Malbec
Argentina,"This firm and dark Cabernet features notes of charcoal, smoke and plenty of berry on the bouquet. Clampy tannins and staunch acidity make for a lively, structured palate, with a saturated berry flavor and a vanilla shading. It is ripe and modern, providing proof that Argentina can make excellent Cabernet in addition to Malbec.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Light and lemony aromas blend into lychee scents, while the palate is textured and fairly full, with dry, melony flavors along with green fruit and lychee. Finishes full, with moderate intensity. A quaffing wine to drink now.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Earthy and spicy up front, with modest heat and floral aromas. There's not much structure or body here, but it's juicy and just tasty enough due to good candied berry and plum flavors. A regular but steady everyday Cab.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Floral and light on the nose, with lemon blossom and peach notes. The palate has a fresh feel courtesy of proper acidity, while the apple and pineapple flavors are nice. Finishes tropical, with good jump and bounce.",White Blend
Argentina,"Fairly ripe, full and attractive, with dark plum aromas. The palate has bounce, jump and a bit of acidic sharpness, while the plum and berry flavors are generic but good. Sweet on the finish; standard and healthy stuff.",Malbec
Argentina,"The bouquet is floral and lightly jammy, with berry aromas and a savory note or two. Turns a touch soupy and salty in the mouth, where the red fruit flavors thin out quickly. Finishes without much punch, but at least it's solid.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Tangerine and citrus aromas give the bouquet an orangey element, and there's a pinch of oak and tarragon in there as well. The palate has a mild, buttery texture and creamy flavors of peach and apple. Honeyed and creamy on the simple finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Fiery and clipped on the nose, but then it settles onto red fruits and candy notes. The palate shows good grip and a proper but basic feel, with generic red berry and currant flavors. Solid on the finish; good in a common way.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Aromas of sweet grass, vanilla cookie, lime and lychee are welcoming on the nose. This is a melony, round style of Torrontés, featuring apple and lychee notes. Flavorful and friendly, with a moderate finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"A huge improvement over recent years, this wine offers pure cassis, berry and leather aromas. The palate is round, smooth and jammy, with fresh flavors of cherry, berry and cassis.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dark in style, with graham cracker, shoe polish, hard spice and blackberry aromas. It feels staunch and edgy, then tastes deep, with a blackberry flavor backed by rubber and chocolate. The finish is marked with cocoa powder and vanilla notes.",Malbec
Argentina,"The nose boasts concentrated plum and berry aromas. On the palate, this feels full and complete, with blackberry, mild spice and a hint of salt. It's crisp and focused on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"A touch chunky and oily on the nose, but for the most part it smacks of tropical fruit and correct varietal aromas. The palate is plump but healthy, with mellow green melon and lemon-lime flavors. Standard but fine; drink now.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Mildly baked and raisiny on the nose, then more varietal in character in the mouth. There's sweet and spicy cherry as well as brown sugar flavors along with good acidity and medium-bodied elegance that pushes the wine along. Basic on the finish, with a hint of lasting candied sweetness.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"An elegant, better-than-most Torrontés with floral, tropical aromas sitting in front of melon, lemon and lychee flavors. The texture and weight suggest melon, and the finish has just the right level of glycerol and grab. Very nice Torrontés that manages to distinguish itself.",Torrontés
Argentina,"An extracted, full-bodied style of Malbec with blackberry aromas, density, meatiness and heft. It's thick and a bit awkward, especially early on, and then a roasted berry quality takes over. Solid as a rock, somewhat floral and young, with good kick at the end.",Malbec
Argentina,"Starts out with leathery, cheesy aromas; soon those scents evolve into red fruit aromas and vanilla. The palate is a bit tannic and tight, with medicinal cherry, cassis and peppery flavors. Crisp and sheer as well on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"The focus here is on red fruits and zest more than richness and weight. The palate is snappy, with raspberry and red plum flavors along with vanilla shadings. Candied and just full enough on the finish, with mild herbal notes.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fresh and straightforward on the nose, with tropical fruit aromas. The palate is pulpy but good, with flavors of fruit punch and melon. Turns a little sweet and pithy on the finish, but holds it together. Perfectly good for the price.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Tight berry aromas lead the way, followed by a lively but aggressive palate with jammy, sweet, candied berry flavors. Turns a little syrupy and sweet on the finish, but overall it succeeds in a generic sort of way.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Dark, smoky and charred on the nose, with herbal black fruit sitting under that. Call it a saturated cheek-grabber with rubbery tannins and sweet flavors of plum and blackberry. Shows coffee and toast in front of herbal, salty finishing notes.",Malbec
Argentina,"Floral aromas are soft, while the flavors of lychee and pear are sweet. Full, round and a touch oily in feel, this is more in the weighty, peachy style of the grape. Good but drink now, chilled.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Dark and rubbery on the nose, with a slight pickle-and-olive accent but mostly black fruit aromas. Juicy and also stout in terms of feel, with blackberry and herbal flavors. Finishes with a touch of buttery oak, chocolate and toast.",Merlot
Argentina,"Rubbery and roasted on first impression, with jammy berry aromas coming out later. The palate runs soft to the point of almost being mushy, while it tastes of baked black plum, fig and grape juice. Soft all around, with just enough vitality.",Malbec
Argentina,"A bit stalky on the nose, with tropical aromas and lychee. The palate is a little broken down and heavy, with flat citrus and lychee flavors. Finishes wan, with dried apricot notes.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Medicinal black cherry aromas turn heavier and more prune-like with air. The palate is reasonably solid and healthy in feel, but monotonous and devoid of layering. Tastes tangy, zesty and mostly clean, with slightly baked flavors and a spot of heat.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Familar aromas of cherry, plum and berry are on the money. This is tight as nails on the palate, this and nevertheless thrusts with boysenberry, blackberry and a hint of amaro. A wall of finishing tannin carries flavors of chocolate and black spice. Big, ripe and serious.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Intense on the nose, this has spice, leather and ripe berry aromas. It feels clean, plummy, juicy and bright, with lifted red and black fruit flavors. Showing chewy tannins and additional juiciness on the finish, it's very nice and delivers the goods.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fiery at first, this also has mint and toast notes to the otherwise black-fruit-scented nose. It feels tannic and drawing, but strong boned. Flavors of roasted black fruit are bolstered by olive, chocolate and spicy toast accents. Finishes savory and firm.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This is an admirable aged Malbec, but it's definitely tannic and tough. The nose is hard and rubbery, with tire, mushroom, graphite and black cherry aromas. Feels tight as nails, with burnt caramel, tomato, green herb and cassis flavors. This finishes with some warmth.",Malbec
Argentina,"Slightly granular smelling and seemingly oversized on the bouquet. In the mouth it folds itself back into standard form, with earthy, jammy flavors of wild berry and spice. Seems a touch heavy and slightly green on the finish, but overall it gets the job done.",Merlot
Argentina,"After not having seen this Tempranillo in several years, I'm reminded of why the variety is shaky at best in Argentina. This bottling, with its weight and obvious oak, is slightly raisiny on the nose and then big, cheesy and earthy on the palate. It has heft but a wiry feel, and the finish is full of leather, tobacco and dried fruit flavors. Drink now.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Opens with soft black fruit aromas, and later orange peel and floral notes enter the picture. This is a ripe style of wine with body and heft. Blackberry, sweet black plum, chocolate and brown sugar control the flavor profile, and while it's sweet and arguably confected, overall it's a solid blend of two hearty grapes.",Malbec-Syrah
Argentina,"Dusty cherry and raspberry aromas give this  wine a clean, inviting opening. The palate is a touch clacky due to choppy tannins, but the flavors of red cherry, plum and red licorice, while narrow in scope, are perfectly nice and tasty. Sort of generic but a good blend of 60% Malbec and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dark and a little baked on the nose, with prune, fig and earthy aromas. The palate is a bit hard and reduced, with pounding tannins, but the fruit is equally big and ripe, so it all seems to be correct. Mellow on the finish, with a hint of chocolate. Good Merlot for the price.",Merlot
Argentina,"Pencil lead and rubbery, mature berry aromas open this wine. The palate is driven by energetic, pounding tannins and flavors of black cherry and tomato, which become more prominent as the tannins and acid rebound. This is an indication of how Argentine Cabernet Sauvignon ages.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Sweet and light smelling, with sugar cookie and blueberry aromas. The palate is medium in weight, with snappy acids and dry, lightly herbal flavors of raspberry and red plum. Mostly fresh on the finish, but with little volume or follow through.",Malbec
Argentina,"Earthy aromas suggest red cabbage and olive more than bright, ripe berry. The palate is chunky and clampy, with jammy, overly broad black fruit flavors that finish on the stewed and herbal side. Concentrated, massive and clumsy.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Opens with gumball aromas and also foresty spice and bramble. The palate is tight and tannic as it delivers standard red licorice, berry and leathery flavors. Finishes with some salty leather and that's about it.",Malbec
Argentina,"For a $5 wine, it offers pretty good red berry aromas along with a decent mouthfeel and proper acidity. The palate pops with red plum and raspberry flavors along with mild stalky, brambly notes that are more in the background than up front. Not overwhelming but doesn't disappoint.",Malbec-Bonarda
Argentina,"This is jammy and bulky from the get-go, with heavy fruit aromas leading to a saturated, dense palate that feels thick. Baked, blackened flavors of sweet blackberry, chocolate and mocha mark the palate.",Malbec
Argentina,"This opens with red fruit aromas that are wrapped around earth and leather scents, yielding a rustic whole. It feels snappy, with red fruit acidity leading to a gritty, lively palate, with flavors of brown sugar, red pepper, plum and raspberry. Long on the finish but short on texture.",Syrah
Argentina,"Tropical and pure on the nose, this has aromas of lychee, lime, talcum powder and candle wax. It feels juicy and healthy, with flavors of apple, lime and lychee. The finish is steady and pure.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Sweet, tropical aromas lead the way, followed by notes of melon and vanilla. It feels fresh, with citrus and lychee flavors. The finish is tropical and green tasting, with nervy acidity.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Asphalt and gaseous aromas take a while to settle, but after they do, leather and scratchy blackberry scents surface. It feels big and brawny, with max extraction. It tastes masculine but salty, with bitter chocolate and peppery accents. Bulky for $11 wine.",Syrah
Argentina,"Violet in color, this has ample berry and cassis notes on the bouquet. It feels edgy and grabby, with oaky, spicy plum and blackberry flavors. The fruit component fades fast on the finish, leaving a dry, peppery aftertaste.",Malbec
Argentina,"Deep purple in color, with an inky nose that brings licorice and jammy black fruit aromas. This is a lush, soft-bodied style of Syrah with a meaty mouthfeel and candied, jammy flavors of blackberry and stewed black cherry. Finishes sweet and chocolaty; could use a bit more structure and spine.",Syrah
Argentina,"Smoky, spicy and a bit jammy on the nose; this Bonarda loads up on black fruits and floral characteristics. It's a good, honest interpretation of the grape, and it's a solid bet for pizza and burgers. A bit syrupy in the mouth and on the finish, with a candied lushness that makes it soft in the long run.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Fresh and citrusy on the nose, with apple and gooseberry notes. The palate is jumpy, tangy and zesty, with lemon, lime and pineapple flavors. Not the most “varietal” SB going, but it's tangy and lively nonetheless. Hanging in well for a 2008, but drink now.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Opens with hard, rubbery, leathery aromas. In the mouth, it's thick and chewy with black fruit but also an herbal edge. There's depth and plenty of oak here, and it finishes sweet and relatively smooth. Starts rough, improves in the middle, and then finishes fairly well.",Malbec-Syrah
Argentina,"A nice, highly affordable bottling that highlights Argentina's value potential. The palate is soft, almost silky, with melted tannins and full flavors of raspberry and ripe plums. There's even some toasty warmth to the finish. A textbook easy rider.",Malbec
Argentina,"A good effort for the money. The nose has rubber and bold fruit, while the palate has a natural, balanced feel and nice flavors of berry, cassis, brown sugar and chocolate. Blends juiciness with enough weight and sweetness to rate highly in the value class.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Starts out with nice black cherry and cassis aromas before transitioning to roasted plum and prune flavors that come with sticky, fierce tannins and plenty of heat and grab. A very big and hard wine with midnight darkness but little subtlety. Finishes with sweet flavors of caramel and brown sugar.",Meritage
Argentina,"Slightly hard and herbal at first blush, but exhibiting more purity and depth of fruit as it opens. Flavors of sweet berries and plum are generic but welcome, and the palate is full and tannic. Overall it's pretty well stacked with fruit and power; it's also tannic and stout.",Malbec
Argentina,"Nicely aromatic, with all that's good about affordable Malbec from Argentina: bold fruit, depth and some richness. The palate is plump and stocked with tasty blackberry, plum and raisin flavors, while the finish is sturdy and subtle. A good wine that should not offend anyone.",Malbec
Argentina,"Stalky red-fruit aromas suggest rhubarb and nettles. It feels fresh, lean and dry, with flavors of herbal berry, snappy red cherry and tomato. It turns more stalky and herbal on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"For a sweet Chardonnay, this is good and enticing. The nose is clean, with peach, melon and honeyed aromas. The palate is balanced and smooth, with a good blend of stickiness and acidity. Tastes only slightly candied, with melon and mango flavors. A good dessert-style Chard in a field that doesn't have many players.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"The nose is like a glass of fresh-poured Sprite but without the burning fizz. The palate has a cidery feel and direct flavors of lime, green apple and not fully ripe pineapple. Finishes a little pithy and bitter, with some of Torrontés' notorious burn. Good Torrontés for immediate drinking.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Earthy and spicy on the nose, with tomato and raisin but also some herbal green, which is likely attributable to the 50% Cabernet in this Malbec-CS blend. Tame on the palate, with tomatoey notes and dry raspberry flavors. Simple and pleasant but more herbal and less exciting that Gradum's straight '05 Malbec.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A white blend made from Riesling, Albariño and Savagnin. It lacks specificity on the nose while offering up floral, citrusy aromas. In the mouth, it's plump and soft, with sweet melon, spice and a honeyed finish that also shows pith and mild bitterness. Interesting but a little heavy, sweet and amorphous.",White Blend
Argentina,"Floral aromas lead the show, backed by meatiness, minerality and wild sage and thyme aromas. The palate is fresh and young, with edgy but saturated plum and raspberry flavors. Turns more narrow and simple with time, but for a basic Malbec it more than gets the job done.",Malbec
Argentina,"Multifaceted on the nose, with aromas of horse saddle and mulch that give way to cleaner floral and berry liqueur scents. The palate is thick, chewy and on the softer side, while the flavors shows rich berry flavors that hint at syrup. Chewy, with a coffee-like essence to the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Black cherry and a light floral perfume get this generic Cab going in the right direction. The palate is healthy but not heavy, while the flavors of red berries and currants are tasty but anonymous to the point that it's hard to identify the wine as Cabernet Sauvignon. Still, it's smooth, fruity and easy to drink.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Light and cheesy smelling, this has herbal red-fruit aromas. It feels quick and hard across the palate, with strawberry, raspberry and herbal flavors.",Shiraz
Argentina,"The scratchy berry aromas are solid upfront—good enough to urge a swig of this wine. What comes next is a soupy, herbal, tomato-influenced Malbec that finishes like gazpacho.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cola, black fruit and a pinch of green herbs define the bouquet on this solid bargain Cabernet. The palate has a good, healthy feel and flavors of roasted berry, pepper and cola. Finishes mildly minty yet juicy.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A sturdy Merlot with a black cherry-driven nose. The palate is kind of sticky and maybe a touch over the top in terms of its syrupy feel and flavors. It's a ripe and oaky wine with a baked character and candied finishing flavors. Flavorful and full, but also sweet and sticky.",Merlot
Argentina,"Aromas of talcum powder, lime and melon are simple, sweet and pretty good. The palate is clean and zesty, with gooseberry, melon and citrus flavors. Quite fruity and long on the finish for such a basic NV Sauvignon.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"With aromas of talcum powder, gardenia and lychee, this offers classic Torrontés aromas. The palate is wet, refreshing and not at all heavy, and the flavors of gooseberry, lychee and lemon are simple but nice. Good, tasty and clean, which is all you can ask for from $10 Torrontés.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Shows pretty good concentration and depth on the nose, where it only slightly hints at the herbal character that comes later. The palate is a touch astringent, with cola, blackberry and herbal flavors. Persistent on the finish, but also herbal and not overly complex.",Malbec
Argentina,"For a five-grape blend priced like this, Don Tiburcio is well worth a go. The nose is rich and jammy, much like berry marmalade. The palate is on the heavy side, with sweet flavors of raisins, prune and chocolate. Rich on the finish, with fig and black plum as well as candied accents and tannic leftovers.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Opens with bold, cuddly black fruit aromas, which are backed by a palate of driving tannins and dark berry and chocolate flavors. Not a lot of complexity or angles to ponder, but the wine's fruit content and mouthfeel are both more than good for the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is hard coated with a creamy plastic note and a milk chocolate scent. Overall it smells heavily oaked and artificial. It feels resiny, with sticky tannins and thickness, tasting of hickory and carob.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is minty green up front, with a dilute cherry aroma. It feels hollow with green flavors that override mild red-fruit notes. Herbal on the finish.",Syrah
Argentina,"This smells like citrus and rhubarb more than Malbec, with a tart, herbal palate that's high in acid and short on enjoyability.",Malbec
Argentina,"Competent from the start, with well-formed fruity aromas of raspberry and plum. There's even some leather and dried cheese to the nose. In the mouth, it's all about earthy, intense berry fruit and juicy freshness. Finishes a little tart but lively, with good form and feel.",Malbec
Argentina,"Standard all the way, but isn't that what we want from a $9 wine? The nose offers raspberry and strawberry aromas, while the flavors are generic but familiar, with a lean toward cherry and berry. Solid on the finish, and fairly intense as a whole. Imported by Clock Tower Imports.",Malbec
Argentina,"Heavy, inky and seemingly a bit overripe, with grassy, doughy, cake-like aromas. The palate is simple and soft, and it comes with deep berry, candy and herbal flavors. More herbal on the finish, with coconut entering the picture.",Malbec
Argentina,"Mild citrus blossom and a hint of mineral make for an average, quiet nose. The palate is equally standard, with midland white fruit flavors and green melon. Soft, light and short on the finish. Drink now or wait for the 2010.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Dusty and subdued on the nose, but still friendly and varietally correct, with lychee and melon aromas. The palate is chunky, maybe a touch flatter than ideal, with citrus and lychee flavors. Finishes in regular fashion, with a pinch of bitterness and white pepper.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Clean as anyone should reasonably expect given the almost unheard-of price. It offers solid cherry and blackberry flavors, while the mouthfeel is round and totally inoffensive. Drink it now; cook with it; make a sangria with it. Just enjoy it.",Malbec
Argentina,"Slightly stalky on the nose, with aromas of haystack and snappy citrus fruits. The palate is citrusy and acidic, with flavors of orange and grapefruit. Rounds into form with airing and time in the glass, but overall it's just a modest, regular SB for basic purposes.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Roasted dark fruit aromas form a generic opening, while the palate is perfectly acceptable even with some scratchiness. The flavors are your basic berries and pepper, while the finish is dry and toasty. Good but regular, plain and simple.",Merlot
Argentina,"This is a real blaster of a Malbec, showing power, concentration and subtleties. The bouquet is full of graham cracker, cola, monster berry and moss notes, while the pure, driving palate deals flavors of toasty blackberry, spice, mocha and more. The lengthy but mellow finish hums like a fine-tuned machine. Drink now–2018.",Malbec
Argentina,"This smells as deep as an ocean trench, with mint, cola, blackberry and toast aromas all rolled into a tight bomb that's ready to explode. It feels balanced yet densely concentrated, with wild berry, tobacco, savory spice and even a mild saucy component. This finishes smooth, with integrated leather, herb and berry flavors. Drink any time over the next 5–6 years.",Malbec
Argentina,"This small-production Malbec is superb. The bouquet smells mossy, earthy, dense and loaded with smooth berry aromas. It's lush, deep and well balanced on the palate, with powerful black-fruit flavors along with fudge, tobacco and cola notes. The feel, flavors and length are all top quality. Drink now–2018; only 230 cases were made.",Malbec
Argentina,"By Belasco de Baquedano, this is a chunky, low-acid Malbec with mint, raisin and slightly damp, earthy undertones. The palate is weighty almost to the point of syrupy, while the flavors are of cola and sweet berries. Soft and slightly herbal, but good in a no-fuss sort of way.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rubbery and warm on the nose, with good berry aromas that turn flatter under the microscope. The palate shows sweet, baked berry flavors and brown sugar, while the feel is round, gritty and full of life. Nice for $8.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cola, black cherry and lemony grit mark the bouquet, which is backed by acid-driven, lightly lemony flavors of cherry and raspberry. There's isn't a ton of volume, depth or follow-through to this wine; it is what it is: fresh, tangy and straightforward.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is a straightforward, regular Cab with berry/cherry aromas and flavors. Nothing is out of the ordinary; the palate is bright and focused on simple berry flavors, while the finish has proper feel, lift and power. Shows a good mixture of fruit, acid and tannin.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A chunky wine with a full, round, sweet, tropical outlook. The nose settles on pineapple chunks, while the creamy palate features flavors of baked yellow apple and melon. Finishes upright, which is better than many. Not sophisticated but still good for Argentina.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A nice, regular sort of Malbec for everyday drinking. The nose is familiar, with basic berry aromas that have some sharpness, while the palate is solid if a bit tangy, with lively cherry flavors. Juicy and fresh, although slightly angular in feel. Ages only three months in oak, hence the fruit-forwardness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smells largely neutral, with slightly earthy red fruit aromas. The palate is soft and creamy, what I'd call low in acidity, with mellow, mildly baked flavors of black cherry and chocolate powder. Finishes full and plump, but calls out to be drunk right away.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"This brand has done well in the past few years with its value-priced Cabernet. This one performs in upstanding fashion, with clean plum, berry and cassis aromas, turning to blackberry and toast flavors on the firm palate. Dark, spicy and a touch warm on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Exotic aromas of wild berries, cumin and other Middle Eastern spices are interesting and inviting. This feels thick and chewy, bordering on syrupy, with stewed plum and brown sugar flavors. It hits with some burn and heat on the bullish finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Jammy stuff, with hints of mint, leather and cotton candy. The palate is basic, with adequate structure and nicely presented berry fruit as well as herbal accents. Sweet on the finish, with some sugary stickiness. Gets better with time in the glass.",Malbec
Argentina,"Starts with bulky fruit and bacon aromas. The palate is sort of rattled and jagged in terms of feel, while the flavors of baked berry fruit slip toward herbal. All in all, it's a pleasant, jammy, friendly, easy-to-drink, generic Cabernet.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Here's a crisp by-the-glass style of Pinot that's bringing good cherry and raspberry aromas, mild spice notes, and then a firm but lean body with plenty of acidity to propel crisp, cutting flavors of red plum and tart berry. Light and sheering but not sour or too thin.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"A little hard on the nose, with burnt undertones. The palate is hollow in the middle and the wine collapses on itself. As for flavors, look for mildly toasted and creamy white fruits and vanilla.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Somewhat jammy and soupy on the nose, with a flavor profile that follows suit; it tastes slightly stewed and spicy, with both sweet fruit flavors and some bitterness. Finishes much like a soup or stew, with herbal, earthy notes. Adequate but not super fresh or fruity.",Merlot
Argentina,"Big and modern, this has simmering aromas of turned earth, graham cracker, leather, plum and blackberry. It feels megasaturated but well balanced, with hugely ripe black-fruit, chocolate and toasted marshmallow flavors. Warm and nearly Port-like, this is full of toffee and fudge notes on the finish. It's a flashy, polished, 21st-century red wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Gorgeous balsam wood and graphite aromas blend seamlessly with ripe berry and black coffee scents. It feels lively yet cushioned, tasting like a wicked brew of maple, tobacco, berry pie and fine wood shavings. This is smooth, long and comfortable on the tobacco- and resin-flavored finish. Drink now–2018.",Malbec
Argentina,"Not short on intensity but it is a little candied and gummy on the nose. It remains somewhat jammy in the mouth, with a mild creaminess softening up edgy red berry flavors. Good but candied and basic.",Malbec
Argentina,"A little bit baked, but overall it's a good, semirich Malbec with roasted, dark fruit flavors and a backdrop of chocolate. The palate has slightly more acidity than you might expect, so it doesn't come across heavy or out of whack. Regular wine done well.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dense, soupy and a little raisiny, with an overripe quality to the nose. Jammy in the mouth, but on the palate things unwind and improve. The flavors are of ultraripe but not cooked berry fruit, while the finish hints at stewed and chocolaty. Only go here if you like full, rich, sweet red wines.",Malbec
Argentina,"A chunky style of SB with apple and green melon aromas. The palate is a bit soft and mealy, while the flavors revolve mostly around lemon. It's also pithy, zesty and a touch bitter on the finish. Not easy to peg as Sauvignon Blanc; drink now to capture its remaining freshness.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Sharp and leathery on the nose, with murky, leathery aromas. The palate has a soupy but acceptable mouthfeel with flavors of roasted, savory berry and tobacco. Seems a little cooked and tired, but with just enough signs of life to make it worth a try.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Roasted cherry and rubber aromas comprise the nose. The mouth has sharp acidity, which causes tang and zestiness to go with standard blackberry and dark plum flavors. Other than the acidic sharpness, this is a solid everyday Cab.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Orange blossom and other common white fruit aromas make for a standard, generic type of bouquet. The palate is regular in feel and weight, with shy flavors of melon and apple. Entirely middle of the road in aromas, body, feel and flavors.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Not a bad little SB for bargain shoppers. It's soft and simple, with white fruit aromas and a touch of orange blossom on the nose. The palate is easy in feel, with mild citrus flavors. Innocuous as they come.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Smooth and polished, this bears cola, earth, blackberry and floral aromas. It shows power and precision, with silky tannins, integrated acidity and deep flavors of berry, leather and herb. This is slightly minty, smoky and spicy on the back end, where fine oak takes charge. Drink now–2015.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is cool, earthy and tight on the nose. Then it opens and blooms, with classy roasted notes that set the stage for a smooth-rolling palate with bold blackberry, herb and chocolate flavors. By the time it finishes, complex bitter-chocolate and toast notes have taken over. This is primed and ready to drink.",Malbec
Argentina,"Robust up front, with bacony aromas mixed with leather, violet, pickle and blackberry. The palate is crisp and racy, with a fresh, acic-driven profile that's dotted with raspberry and blackberry. Has its share of flare but also some heat and unabsorbed acidity.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smells sweet and artificial, with chemical notes and overwrought vanilla. Juicy in the mouth, with flesh and freshness. But the flavors are oaky, so much so that the wine's citrus and apple quality is masked. Finishes with grapefruit and bitterness. Weird and all over the map.",Chardonnay-Viognier
Argentina,"Opens with warm, baked black fruit aromas and then a wave of woodiness takes control. The palate is round, full and sticky, with beefy but generic black fruit flavors and too much oak. Finishes with vanilla and resin; not a bad wine but needs more balance and fruit.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"A touch tough and stemmy on the nose, but given the price it rates as positive. The body is medium and friendly, while the flavors of raspberry and strawberry feature a peppery accent. Finishes crisp and fresh.",Malbec
Argentina,"While I generally like and sometimes even love the Cobos wines, this Merlot underwhelms. The nose is reedy and stemmy, with earthy, herbal raspberry aromas. In the mouth, it's scratchy and spicy, with herbal berry fruit leading to a mildly bitter finish. Better than in the past, but still a compromised wine due to its minty, green characteristics.",Merlot
Argentina,"Smells both nutty and warm as well as citric and sharp. The palate keeps that pace; it's citrusy and cidery in feel, with orange, banana and spice flavors. Finishes quick and a little heavy. 70% Chardonnay and 30% Sauvignon Blanc.",Chardonnay-Sauvignon
Argentina,"Crimson in color but also translucent, with a candied, slightly green nose. Overall this is a simple quaffer with no excess weight and reasonably good flavors of berry and plum. Bland on the finish, but for $4 who's caring about finish?",Malbec-Syrah
Argentina,"This opens with persuasive aromas of wild berry and cassis before cola and leather notes enter. It's a powerfully built Malbec with bright acidity, strong bones and pure, bold flavors of blackberry and black cherry. This is youthful and more fruit focused than the oakier DJN 2006 Reserva Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Powerful but reduced, with gritty berry aromas and a ton of clove on the nose. There's a carry over of the clove in the mouth, and also roasted fruit flavors, wood spice and sweetness. Powerful for sure, but arguably a bit too woody for its own good.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sweet haystack and banana aromas carry some smoke and burnt stalk, while the creamy, tropical palate shows pithy citrus fruit and sweet banana flavors. Tropical on the finish, but also slightly bitter. Solid by Mendoza standards but nothing special.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Pretty well composed on the nose, with a core of blackberry. The palate runs narrow and grabby, but the generic sweet berry fruit is tasty, albeit ultrasimple. Snappy on the finish, with the gritty feel of cherry and grape skins. Good in a basic way.",Merlot
Argentina,"Smoky and rubbery on the nose, with some green oak aromas. The palate has a soft, pasty quality to it as well as flavors of black cherry and mildly roasted berries. Finishes sort of bland and slightly herbal. Good but entirely basic in its approach.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A little flat, but the nose is adequately melony, so give it points for that. The palate is on the plump, lower-acid side, so the green fruit and lychee flavors are fleshy. Finishes solid but soft. Drink this year.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Rusty in color, with a mildly mulchy, leafy nose that's also slightly floral and smells of orange peel. Zesty in the mouth, with a lean profile and tart flavors of red cherry, plum and herbs.",Malbec
Argentina,"A lot of oak. The nose is honeyed and heavy, with too much toast and butter. In the mouth, it's got kicking acids but the flavors are sweet, oaky and veer toward banana. Resiny on the finish; underwhelming for the price.",Chardonnay
Argentina,Generic melon and peach aromas precede a slightly forced and sweet palate with melony flavors and some tail-end bitterness. The finish is creamy and shows vanilla as well as peach and toast notes. Very basic Chardonnay given the price.,Chardonnay
Argentina,"Yellow in color, blowsy on the nose, and chunky to the max in the mouth. This wine is big, forced and heavy, with orange, banana and melon flavors. Finishes soft and with no discernible oak or elegance.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Aromas of mealy apple and citrus are less than inviting, while the palate is citrusy but lacking in true Chardonnay character; instead it shows odd flavors of ham and orange juice. Ranks as yet another uninspired Argentine Chard in a long line of such wines.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Dark and heavily extracted, with a big, rubbery, gaseous bouquet that foretells the rest of the wine, which is herbal and full-bodied, with baked plum and berry flavors. Finishes oaky, with drying tannins and heat.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Smells murky, leafy and of compost. The palate is lean, dry and slightly rough, with green herb, tomato and light raspberry and strawberry flavors. Finishes herbal and tea-like, with more earthiness than clarity.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Neutral on the nose except for a spot of peach and citrus. The palate is soft and chunky, with generic citrus flavors that suggest passion fruit and grapefruit. Turns a little mealy on the finish, so drink ASAP.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Forward and simple, with red fruit and citrus on the nose. The palate is lean and light bodied, with tangy, dry red fruit flavors, orange and sour sucking candy. Quite tangy on the finish, and overall it achieves only a certain level of weight and prominence. No oak.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"This is floral and candied upfront, with a red licorice note. It feels full and fleshy, with hints of red berry and cassis, with not too much oak on the palate. Ripe, basic, clean and sweet as a whole.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is a cuddly, jammy, ripe Malbec with maple, blackberry and oak aromas. It feels weighty and lush, with large-scale boysenberry, blackberry and blueberry flavors. It turns a little soft and basic on the finish, but there's no griping about this wine's purity and fruit content.",Malbec
Argentina,"Spunky right off the bat, this has floral and fresh fruit aromas that fall squarely into the wild berry category. It feels lively on the palate, with spiked acidity but enough weight and depth to absorb it. This tastes like a mix of plum, blackberry and chocolate, and the finish darkens up with notes of pepper and spice. Drink now–2017.",Malbec
Argentina,"Subtle on the nose, with restrained berry, cherry and citrus peel aromas. The palate is a little grabby but mostly fresh in its approach, with flavors of fresh berry fruit. Light and mildly candied on the finish. A no-brainer that's easy as they come.",Merlot
Argentina,"Slightly oily on the nose, with a fair amount of baby powder. The palate is round and wet, but also fairly regular in its intensity and approach. Flavors of green melon run toward fat and easy, while the finish is in the same mode.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Pungent and a little pickled on the nose, with oak and cream coming on a second wave. The palate is composed, normal in feel and shows slightly choppy cherry and berry flavors. Regular but short on the finish. Good wine; nothing more than that.",Malbec
Argentina,"Slightly green and a touch mulchy. The palate offers a decent mix of red fruits, herbal flavors and leathery notes. Finishes salty and choppy, but overall it's not a bad wine for the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"Seems slightly mealy on the nose, and then comes a tired set of flavors that includes mushy apple and spice. Finishes easy but dilute, with a pithiness that's normal for the variety. It's the current vintage but it already seems passé.",Torrontés
Argentina,"A touch soupy and leafy on the nose, with a green element as well. The palate feel is clacky and firm, with herbal berry and green finishing flavors. Better in terms of feel and structure than flavors and aromas; a marginal Cab from a cool year.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Rubbery and gaseous, and frankly it's just not very fresh or inviting. The mouthfeel suggests astringency, while the flavors are salty and earthy but not very fruity. Finishes with a leathery feel and tannic grab.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Heat and horseradish define the sharp, peppery bouquet. The palate is tannic and grabby, with leafy red-fruit flavors and an added dose of herbs and pepper. Finishes medicinal and peppery. At this price it isn't shining.",Malbec-Syrah
Argentina,"Green and herbal, with a mix of jammy raspberry and weediness to the nose. The palate feels heavy and grabby, while the flavor profile holds onto the bouquet's herbal, tomatoey quality. Overly peppery and green throughout.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Smells a bit acrid, with aromas of peach pit and chemical. The palate is short on structure and offers punch-like sweetness in the mango/papaya field of play. Very juicy but not tasting or smelling very defined.",White Blend
Argentina,"This full and ripe Cabernet has berry and black cherry aromas. Tannic, narrow and tough on the tongue, it is blasting with flavors of blackberry, mint and black coffee. It's fruit flavor is met with plenty of kick and grab. Can age for a year.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Mossy and inky in smell, this has a firm palate. Flavors of berry, herb and chocolate set up a dry finish, with structure and background complexities. Spicy and herbal, it has a Chilean sort of character.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Lemony and stretched on the nose, with resiny oak aromas and a light hint of green. The palate has size, tannin and lots of oak, while the flavors run creamy and woody, with generic berry fruit residing under the surface. Decent for under $15, but an excess of oak creates a one-sided final product.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Like most inexpensive Malbecs, there are some strained aromas here: tire rubber, stemmy fruit and cranberry. But in the mouth it has good body and grab, with roasted fruit flavors and a touch of hickory. Savory and pretty good for under $10.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lychee, melon and peach aromas are straight from the textbook, while the palate is forceful and more acidic than many, with aggressive lemon, lime and white grapefruit flavors. Racy and citric, with a cleansing finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Gaseous and rubbery, with leafy compost aromas. Flat, chunky and murky in the mouth, with soft, muddled fruit flavors and a finish of syrup and leftover sweetness. Comes up short on character, quality and clarity.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cheesy and way too earthy and murky to be rewarded with anything higher than an acceptable rating. The feel is scratchy and raw, while the flavors seem roasted, overly earthy and dry.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Nutty on the nose and lacking that patented tropical pop. The palate is maderized and not 100% fresh, with a waxy set of flavors and a Sherry-style finish. Over the hill.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Hard, oily, prickly and not impressive by global Sauvignon Blanc standards. The palate deals semisour grapefruit and passion fruit flavors, and the finish is a monotone continuation of the primary flavors.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Gold in color and about as overoaked as a white wine can be. This blend of Viognier, Chardonnay and Riesling is all resin and barrel spice. It actually offers some sophistication in terms of mouthfeel, but overall it's grossly out of balance and brutally dominated by oak-based aromas and flavors.",White Blend
Argentina,"Smells like sweet apple pie and wax. The palate is sticky and out of balance, with papaya, vanilla and mealy white fruit flavors. Not very fresh; seems to already be turning south.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"This has fresh berry and flower aromas that lead to a healthy-feeling palate, which is full of cherry, boysenberry and blackberry flavors. Mildly toasty and chocolaty on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"The bouquet is stylish and rooty, with black-fruit and chocolate scents leading the charge. It shows good structure, meaning it's full but not too thick or jammy. Flavors of ripe blackberry and plum are generous and a touch rubbery, while the finish is full and mildly tannic.",Malbec
Argentina,"Baked apple and buttercup aromas get it going in a good way, but the palate doesn't really keep the momentum. It's citrusy but low in acid, while the flavors are simple and narrow as they revolve around citrus fruits. Chunky and soft on the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Smells like floor polish at first. Gets better with time, but still a weak wine of juicy acids, too much oak, not enough fruit and a grating finish. Does nothing to move the dial forward in terms of Argentine Chardonnay.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Smells a lot like compost and green herbs. The palate is bitter, hard and stalky, with grassy flavors and a weedy finish. Tastes burnt out, like old coffee grinds and marginal berry fruit.",Malbec
Argentina,"Hot and horsey, and it remains forced and clumsy in the mouth. Tastes more sour than fruity, with a heavy, short, chunky finish. Drinkable only in an extreme situation.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"This is a little soft and fleshy at moments, while at other times the nose is intense and sturdy. Full and tannic, this has foresty, slightly stewed berry flavors that heat up and turn chunky and toasty on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"There's no other way to put it: Perdriel from Norton is one of Argentina's best high-end blends. It's rich and extracted, but still carries that just-right mix of preserving acidity, structured tannins and dynamite fruit. Opens with chocolate and berry marmalade, and then effortlessly transitions to flavors of cassis, blackberry and fudge. Touches of prune, leather and coffee grace the meaty, substantive finish. 500 cases made.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"A high-end Malbec experience at a reasonable price, this boasts rich aromas of cola, graphite and boysenberry that leap from the glass. The palate is bright and just thick enough, with wild berry, cherry, plum and oak-based flavors. Another whack of oak, along with vanilla, chocolate and tobacco flavors, graces the finish. Drink now–2015.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is floral, exotic and candied smelling, with supporting notes of dusty cocoa and toasty oak. It feels saturated and inky, with a density that borders on too much. Roasted berry, foresty spice, herb and jammy berry flavors set up the woody, menthol-flavored finish. From Gustavo Santaoalla, an Argentine musician and composer.",Malbec
Argentina,"Aromas of brick dust, sweet spice, rubber and leather are good if you're not seeking saturated berry fruit, while the palate is starchy and grabby, with flavors of stewed berry, tomato, leather and earth. Raspberry is detectable on the thin finish, but so is a soupy flavor. Decent wine with some faults.",Merlot
Argentina,"A little bit funky and unsettled when you pop the screwcap, but soon it finds its floral, blueberry base. Remains superficial and sweet in the mouth, with candied flavors, vanilla and mild oak. Highly regular; could use more concentration and density.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sharp, pickled and sour smelling at first, although it does improve with airing. The palate has a good feel and proper size and roundness, yet the berry flavors are ultraherbal. Some oak and spice is detected on the finish. Unappealing on the nose; better on the palate.",Malbec
Argentina,"Consistency in the wine world is a virtue, and Cheval covers the consistency issue with ease. Aromas of earth, mushroom, leather and so forth add an Old World touch to this New World Malbec-Cabernet blend. It's healthy and even juicy on the palate, with blackberry, dark plum and tobacco flavors. An interesting wine that grabs and holds your attention. Drink now through 2012.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Year by year, Salentein's top wines are improving. Primum is truly a fine wine, right up there with the country's best. It's harmonious and inviting, with cola, mineral, floral notes and honest black fruit aromas and flavors. The feel is secure and tight but also well balanced, with a touch of molasses but mostly just deep, driving black fruit. Muscular, intense and long on the finish. Drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rock solid, clean and composed. For the past several years this Malbec-Merlot-Cabernet blend has been an Argentine flag-bearer, and the '05 is as good as past vintages. Look for bold berry flavors accented by medicinal, herbal notes. And then comes a finish that's chewy and round. This is like a fat fastball in the proverbial wheel house; just see it and swing away.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Pointed and narrow at first, this perks up with black fruit and cherry aromas that set the stage for a full-bodied palate with black cherry, cassis and pepper-like heat. A toasty wine with plenty of gas in the tank.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A bit rustic and briary, this has a foresty aroma along with a rooty note and a hint of cola. It feels big and acidic, but the cassis, blackberry and herbal flavors are authentic and hit firmly. The finish is long, mildly herbal and juicy, with weight and power to spare.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This is rooty smelling, with licorice, root beer, tar and smoky notes accenting berry fruit aromas. It feels unctuous but manages to hold onto its balance, and the flavors of baked berry, black plum and savory herb are on the money. The finish is chewy in feel, with a slightly herbal character.",Malbec
Argentina,"Minty, herbal and slightly grassy on the nose, and of course there's berry fruit to boot. The palate has normal feel and balance, with regular red fruit flavors from the currant and cherry family. Lengthy on the finish, but overall it's as basic as they come.",Malbec
Argentina,"Brickish in color, and seemingly thin. Aromas of baked fruit, compost, tobacco, vanilla and burnt coffee are challenging, while the palate is earthy and tastes leafy as well as sweet. On the positive side, it's neither heavy nor overdone. On the negative side, it's thin and on the fade.",Merlot
Argentina,"A little burnt and rubbery on the nose, but with enough lemon and apple to balance things out. The palate is fleshy and soft, with banana and lemon as the lead flavors. Shows a bit of pithy bitterness late, but overall it's good if you like sweet, warm Chardonnays.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Floral but dilute, with mild red fruit scents mixed with herbal fern and juniper aromas. The palate has a good but innocuous mouthfeel, and overall it's fresh but simple, with herbal, generic red fruit and dried oregano flavors.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"The jammy, sweet berry aromas are suggestive of blueberry, cookie and graham cracker. It feels condensed and a bit reduced, with mild tannins and flavors of blueberry, blackberry and herb accents. It's not rough but definitely ripe and flamboyant, with a big, jammy personality.",Malbec
Argentina,"A tough sell at this price. The nose is minty, green and smells of tobacco, spice and fern fronds, while the palate is tangy, clangy in feel and dry. Flavors of semisour, herbal cherry and plum are touched up by sweet oak, but overall it's rather dry and scouring.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Red in color, with neutral aromas of red apple skins. The palate is sticky and weighty, and the taste is akin to fruit punch with tangerine on the side. Tastes o.k. but is too full, chunky and heavy to be refreshing",Malbec
Argentina,"Part of the fun of exploring Argentine Malbec is tasting all the new kids on the block. Having not seen Guentota before, all signs point to high quality. The bouquet is dark, with accents of cola, mineral and burnt toast giving it a masculine edge. Round, plump and full in the mouth, with cherry, berry and cassis flavors. A total package of a wine, with character, nuance and serious base-level fruit.",Malbec
Argentina,"A bit warm and ripe at 15.5%, but the nose of prune, raisin and blackberry is rich and only gets better with airing. The palate features tobacco and savory black fruit, and the finish runs for miles with chocolate and licorice. Despite its weight, there appears to be ample acidity to protect the wine's integrity. A blend of 75% Malbec and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Kaiken Ultra has emerged as a consistent top-shelf Malbec. This vintage shows power, purity, mineral, ripe fruit and well-applied oak. It's a generous wine with kirsch and raspberry parfait flavors. It almost makes it to creamy but by holding onto its core acidity it guards overall balance. Unforced but a little forceful; good for those who like a ripe, meaty red wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pineapple and dusty apple aromas set up a fruity, melony wine, with thick, round flavors of honeydew and sweet apple. Banana and walnut oil notes appear on the finish. Tasted twice; this note reflects the better wine of the two.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Cola, tree bark and rooty aromas become more oaky and toasted with airing. It feels solid and correct, with balanced tannins and acids that stage red plum, cassis, coffee and toasted flavors. Staying toasty and composed on the finish, this is a ripe Cabernet Sauvignon that delivers.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dark purple in color, but more leafy and murky than you'd expect on the nose. The palate has texture and weight, but it's also kind of dull feeling, which matches the wine's chunky, dull flavors. Decent enough, but still too herbal and challenged.",Malbec
Argentina,"Deep and jammy on the nose, and nothing if not potent. But elegance, clarity and sophistication are nowhere to be found as the wine's grapey, soupy, flat character takes over. Bitter on the finish, and throughout there's little to latch onto besides weight and heft.",Malbec
Argentina,"Two vintages of this wine are on the books, and frankly something isn't clicking. After a flat-out weak wine in 2007, this one is showing raisiny, pasty, lactic qualities and too much clumsy sweetness. It's like a cloying ball of blackberry candy accented by bacon fat.",Malbec
Argentina,"The citrusy red-fruit aromas have a sharp note of brine. It feels broad and full, with sweet berry and plum flavors, while snappy raspberry flavors and scratchy tannins work the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"A bit leafy and earthy on first take, but this also smells of roasted meat, berry fruit and menthol. It feels layered and rich, with drying tannins and full-force plum and herb flavors. This is big, dark and herbal, finishing with hints of leather, tomato and oregano.",Malbec
Argentina,"This smells toasty up front, with aromas of tree bark, earth and shoe polish. It runs deep and rich on the tongue, with a syrupy feel and flavors of graham cracker, tobacco, berry pie and herb accents. The finish is good but seems a little hollow, with rooty, herbal flavors that linger.",Malbec
Argentina,"Saturated on the nose, this has aromas of pencil lead, coconut, vanilla and black fruit. It feels tannic, with pulsing acidity pushing raisin, prune, black plum, licorice and graphite flavors. The finish is oaky, resiny and chocolaty tasting.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smells strange, like a bowl of Smucker's raspberry jam or applesauce. The palate is creamy and dull, with flat, jammy, candied red fruit flavors that do little to excite. Finishes with a wave of sweet marshmallow and vanilla.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Salmon colored, with soapy tangerine and nectarine aromas. The palate is watery and soft, with bland citrus and berry flavors. Comes across like a wine cooler that's lost its fizz.",Malbec
Argentina,"Steady as a rock, with smoky, charred aromas mixed with beautiful black fruit scents as well as accents of licorice and earth. For anyone enthralled with New World ripeness, this is the ticket. It's a blend of 70% Malbec and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, and it is lush, packed with blackberry and boysenberry flavors, and viscous on the finish. Complete and special at every level.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Earthy and chunky from the start, this features heavy, granular aromas of blueberry and blackberry. It is huge on the palate but shows little structure or framework to support the heavy berry flavors. Thus, the wine falls flat while tasting sweet and feeling fleshy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Saturated and pitch black to look at, and not much different in scent. This is a fully extracted, modern Bonarda that's well made and generous. Full-bodied wine lovers should like the meaty, dark berry and cocoa flavors. Tannic but layered on the finish.",Bonarda
Argentina,"A rough, harsh nose of mustard and burnt stems does almost nothing to draw you in, while the palate is heavy and sweet, with cloying fruit flavors and weak structure. Not up to par on the global level.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Apartado, a high-flying Bordeaux blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot, shows up only occasionally, but when it does it shines. This vintage is stunning; the black cherry and wild berry flavors are lively and honest, while the wine's structure is just where it should be. With a juicy steak or lamb chops, this wine will bowl you over.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Reedy and minty in smell, this has a green aroma that shares the stage with cassis and plum notes. It feels gritty and choppy, with rustic flavors of burnt leaf, roasted berry and herb. The finish is short on flavor and high on heat.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is a pushy wine with aromas of rubber, pencil eraser, leather, blueberry and oak. It has the tannic grip that creates a certain roughness, while blueberry and spice flavors have fire to them, especially on the finish..",Malbec
Argentina,"Every year this wine seems to get better. This vintage deals notes of lemon pie, melon and lychee on the bouquet, which is followed by a palate that's oily yet racy. Flavors of lychee and pineapple are true to Torrontés, while green herb and lime notes stir things up.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Cheval des Andes brings together Cheval Blanc from St.-Emilion with Terrazas de los Andes, and for the past few years it has been the leader in Bordeaux-style wines from Argentina. The 2004 shows serious barrel notes framing classic aromas of aged gouda, saddle leather, mushroom and concentrated berries. The palate is structured, mildly tannic and layered with blackberry, cassis, raisin and licorice flavors. It's good now or will age nicely for another four to six years.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"This is fresh, showing plenty of pop on the fruit-filled bouquet. It feels wide and jammy, yet grabby and dry because of its firm tannins. Typical of Bonarda, it's full of ripe black-fruit flavors and licorice, while the structured finish makes for a good ending.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Cassis, sugar beet, leather and mild herbal aromas make this Cabernet appealing on the nose. It feels slightly syrupy and resiny, but with its core acidity the palate remains in good shape. Flavors of plum and cassis have a strong vanilla and oak resin accent, while the finish is tannic, roasted and robust.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A touch foxy and reduced on the nose, with jumpy berry aromas, this feels edgy and shows a grating tannic bite. The wine's plum, herb and candied berry flavors are solid, finishing with a dose of blueberry.",Malbec
Argentina,"Concentrated blackberry and black currant aromas are ripe and come with a balsamic note. It feels juicy, full, lively and fresh, with oaky dark-plum flavors accented by rooty, herbal notes. Dry tannins mark the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is fresh and open on the nose, which is what you'd want from a $9 quaffer like this. It tastes good and fruity, with lychee, green apple and spice flavors working together. Vanilla and papaya notes come up on the mild finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Grapey berry aromas come with sweet, reedy notes and a brandied cherry component. It feels condensed but lively, with a mix of sweet, almost tropical flavors that hint at pineapple, wild berry and herb. Tasted twice; this score and note reflects both tastings.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Plum and cola aromas set up a spunky, rubbery Merlot that features a mix of roasted berry and chocolaty oak flavors. It is mild on the finish.",Merlot
Argentina,"This smells familiar and solid, with blackberry, licorice and dark cherry aromas. It feels medium bodied for a high-end Argentine Cabernet, with healthy acidity and probing tannins. The flavors of blackberry and raspberry finish crisp and slightly citric.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Cola, root beer and cherry aromas come with controlled heat. The palate is dense and chewy, with pumped-up tannins supporting very ripe-tasting cassis and cooked plum flavors. It's toasty and spicy on the firm finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Calling this big-boned brew potent may be understating things. This is brawny Tupungato Malbec in full armor. Early oak-driven aromas of hard cheese and char support muscular black fruit scents, while the palate is ripe and sweet as it offers blackberry and cassis flavors. Comfortable on the palate and well balanced overall.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark and smoky on the nose, but in a good way, with asphalt and pure blackberry aromas. The wine strikes the palate with immediate grace and power. It's chocolaty yet bright, with toasty oak and vanilla stirring up the finish. A polished and poised wine with a smooth profile.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Commendations go out to this never-fail, high-end blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec. It's arguably a touch brambly and sharp at first, but give it time and any stark, tough characteristics go straight out the window. What's left is nothing but dark-fruit primary flavors, coconut and vanilla finishing notes, and lots of length. Maybe not the best Caro of all time but still a fine wine.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Grapey and inky on the nose, this feels saturated and a bit hot on the palate, with a candied blueberry flavor leading to a grapey finish. Tasted twice, months apart, with similar findings; this score reflects both tastings.",Malbec
Argentina,"After whiffs of burnt rubber and char blow off, this berry-packed Cabernet hits like a small brick with black fruit flavor, which packs punch and aftershocks of cocoa and coffee. Chunky, rough and warm.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"An oaky, complex wine based on Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot, The Blend shows floral notes unmatched by almost all other Mendoza/Tupungato wines. Violets and rose petals interact with earthy fruit on both the nose and palate. And unlike the masses, this wine doesn't make its point by pounding away with overextracted fruit. A different breed but well worth it. Only 40 cases made.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"A little murky and muddled on the nose, this has rubbery tannins and candied, foxy-tasting berry flavors. Nothing harsh or sour here, but it is tannic; at best, it's sweet and simple stuff.",Malbec
Argentina,"This scents of citrus peel and lime, with a plump, oily and round palate that features orange and banana flavors. A blend of 75% Chardonnay and 25% Viognier, it turns melony on the short finish.",Chardonnay-Viognier
Argentina,"With Toso's basic 2006 Malbec being named our Best Buy of the Year for 2007, we find ourselves a bit pinned in judging this higher-priced Reserve Malbec from the same year. With the microscope turned up, however, we find a well-oaked wine with pencil-shaving aromas yielding to coconut and subtle black fruit notes. The palate is dense, structured and full of cherry, cassis and clove flavors. Composed for sure, with tighter acids and tannins than the aforementioned Best Buy champ.",Malbec
Argentina,"Vanilla cookie and stone fruit aromas set up a creamy, mostly fresh-feeling palate, with flowery papaya and green banana flavors. It's tropical in style, with complexity and length to the finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"There aren't many Argentine Sauvignon Blancs that make a statement, so this is commendable for showing a lightly citric and minerally nose in front of fresh, citrusy flavors of lime, tangerine and grapefruit. More friendly and easygoing than intense or pungent, it fades quick and easy on the finish.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Straightforward aromas of black currant and dark plum help create a rich style of Cabernet Sauvignon. It has a syrupy palate that's made firmer by driving tannins. It features a lot of chocolate, baked black-plum and mild herbal flavors. It's ultraconcentrated, and more driving than discerning.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This is extremely aromatically pungent, with notes of honeysuckle, melon and lychee blasting up from the glass. It shows body and an oily quality, with orange, kumquat and peach flavors. This is round, showing a citrus rind flavor on the finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Tropical-smelling and typically melony for the variety, this features citrusy acidity that props up melon, pear and papaya flavors. Bitterness bursts through on the finish, as is often the case with Torrontés.",Torrontés
Argentina,"This has briary, herbal aromas and a sweet beet note. It is syrupy and sappy, with candied cassis and black cherry flavors.",Merlot
Argentina,"This has a saturated purple color, with aromas that are green, inky and grassy. Supertannic and drawing in feel, it has black fruit and chocolate flavors that come across pushy, sweet and hot. It's as bold as they come, but it lacks elegance and harmony.",Malbec
Argentina,"Oily and salinic in aroma, this wine smells like an oyster shell. It feels plump and soft, without much acidity. Honey, banana and mealy flavors rest on the finish of this organic Chardonnay.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Fiery, hard and closed on the nose, this has a chemical hint. It feels acidic and sappy, with a weird mix of flavors that run from fish and fake butter to earthy, leathery raspberry. Stalky on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"This smells shocked and jumpy, then feels raspy as it delivers a sweet, gummy-tasting mix of black cherry and spice flavors.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Oily and a bit harsh on the nose, this is not what you want from a variety best known for its aromas. It feels creamy and oily, with pear and papaya flavors. Melony and thick on the finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Not as good as in previous vintages, this has a distinct minty, shrill quality to the otherwise leathery and foresty bouquet. It feels a bit raw and high in acidity, with plum and herb flavors. Modest on the finish, this stays fairly minty and herbal while remaining fresh.",Malbec
Argentina,"At first, this smells charred and meaty, but blackberry, leather and roasted plum aromas soon sneak out. This runs big, with good acidity and manageable tannins. Flavors of cherry and cassis are lively and familiar.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This opens with a familiar taste of artificial, roasted char, then it moves on to soupy berry aromas. It feels scratchy, with flavors of hickory, baked plum and berry.",Merlot
Argentina,"This wine's finest quality is its white flower fragrance. It feels thick like fruit juice, with plodding lemon-lime, pineapple and banana flavors. Fruity but cloying on the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Roasted in scent, this has black olive and crusty, herbal berry scents. It feels ultratannic and hard, with a graphite note and heat on the palate, along with extremely earthy, demanding, burnt-tasting fruit. Too much funk here.",Malbec-Tannat
Argentina,"A mild lychee aroma vies with a scent of turpentine on the lean nose. It feels crisp but hollow, with papaya and bland banana flavors in front of a vanilla-tinged finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Aromas of dark berry, rubber and a smoky quality define the bouquet. It feels nice, with a slight tannic grab and likable flavors of red berry and pepper. Short on the finish, but it's fresh and clean.",Malbec
Argentina,"Ripe red-fruit flavors are nice and normal, while the palate feels fresh and lifted by balancing acids. Focused raspberry and plum flavors are clean and don't push the oak envelope. Overall, this is lively and fun.",Malbec
Argentina,"Clean and basic up front, with peach and white flower aromas. It feels juicy, with just enough body, bearing fruit salad flavors of nutmeg-dusted white grapes, apple and peach. It turns dry and almondy on the finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Very purple and expressive, with charred barrel aromas that border on burnt. Fortunately, the fruit below is quite healthy, but besides oozing blueberry and blackberry it's not overly defined or regal. Put this Patagonian Malbec into the category of vibrant and interesting and you won't be disappointed.",Malbec
Argentina,"Solid, sweet-styled Cab, this starts out with dark, piercing berry and asphalt aromas, which are followed by an appealing blast of dark-fruit flavors. Turns more aggressive and rugged as it opens, but stays the course.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Burnt and angry in smell, this has earthy red-berry aromas. It feels astringent, with jumbled, baked berry flavors that come with a weedy note. Turns to leather and baked fruit tones on the finish.",Merlot
Argentina,"This wine isn't flawed, but it has a faded waxy banana quality. It tastes, smells and feels creamy and confected.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"This smells of generic red fruit and pasty oak, and it tastes burnt, slightly chemical and rubbery, with creamy berry fruit flavors taking over.",Merlot
Argentina,"Earthy plum and berry aromas are suggestive of Bordeaux, but the brown sugar and baked fruit angle is all Mendoza. Snappy acidity helps the wine stay trim, while linear raspberry and cherry flavors are red in character. This is gripping with an acidic push to the finish.",Cabernet Franc
Argentina,"Walnut, banana, apple and vanilla aromas are nicely presented. The palate holds its own as far as structure, while the melon, apple and honey flavors are friendly. This is a better-than-you'd-expect Chardonnay for everyday drinking.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"This plump, ripe Malbec is aggressive and jumpy on the nose, but the flavors of blackberries and chocolate are pure and positively represent what Argentina can do with value-priced Malbec. If you're not expecting miracles, this thick, textured wine may just win you over.",Malbec
Argentina,"With this wine, you'll get a solid blast of oak and butter on the nose, which is backed by orange, melon and nectarine flavors. There's acidity and kick to it, but also some softer butterscotch and citrus pith notes. More than good by Argentine standards.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Red and black fruit aromas open the nose. The palate feels healthy, with tight tannins and charging flavors of blackberry and dark plum. Pair this with a burger, pasta or pizza.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Getting past the giant blast of oak that dominates the bouquet is not an easy task, but the intrepid wood chopper will find another side to this wine, one that's full of bright, juicy black fruit and syrupy core sweetness. Of course, the oak is always present and with that comes mocha, coffee and vanilla notes. Imported by Gascon USA.",Malbec
Argentina,"This wine seems mulchy and warm; it comes out of the bottle with attitude and some fire. As it settles, you get berry, bramble and leather, and always does it seem a little “traditional” in style rather than modern and polished up. Definitely a full-bodied, oily wine that could use more flavor and fruit.",Malbec
Argentina,"A conflicted and hence confounding wine. The nose is very oaky, but it's a pointed, almost piercing wood and clove bouquet. The wine is fierce in the mouth, with kicking tannins and acidity pushing bulldozer-like blackberry and bitter espresso flavors. With 6% Merlot, this Patagonian Malbec has its virtues but isn't as friendly as past vintages.",Malbec
Argentina,"Berry and earth on the nose are welcoming aromas, and overall this juicy, simple Malbec offers clean lines, a touch of complexity and good balance. The flavors channel berry and plum, and some vanilla runs shotgun. Not overripe or off base.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lots of heavily toasted oak sits atop the bouquet, and thus it's no surprise that the flavor profile runs a bit lemony and sharp. But give the wine time to unfold and you'll find a layer of pure blackberry mixed with notes of chocolate and coffee. Arguably too oaky but with good core qualities.",Malbec
Argentina,"Creamy peach and vanilla aromas are perfectly attractive, as is the palate. There's plenty of peach, mango and citrus pith flavors to make it worthy, and the finish is long and citrusy. Surprisingly good given the paltry price and Argentina's dearth of success with Viognier.",Viognier
Argentina,"This mighty Malbec opens with toasty oak, a pinch of sawdust and perfumed black fruit, vanilla and spice notes. The palate is lofty and rich, with beautiful berry and plum flavors. A smooth, sexy wine from the Uco Valley that shows that vineyard sourcing absolutely matters. Best wine from Alta Vista to date.",Malbec
Argentina,"Penetrating cola, mint and black fruit aromas are probing. It feels tight and gripping, tasting forward and correct for the variety, with bell pepper, black fruit and spice flavors. This is robust, with good flavors and quality fruit.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Graffigna has shown improvement with its current set of releases. This Cab starts out dark, charred and full of blackberry aromas and flavors. It initially seems flashy and ready for anything. But the more you run it across your palate, the more the acidity rises up. And before long it almost seems scouring and jumpy. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Still the king of South American Pinot Noir, Chacra's “55” offers a beautiful amalgam of dusty Middle Eastern spice aromas along with raspberry, cherry and cocoa notes. It's a finessed but forceful (read: high-alcohol) Pinot with penetrating black cherry, plum and chocolate flavors, and the finish is long but hot in its youth. Doesn't lack for much of anything. Best from late 2010 through 2013.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Brilliantly colored, with dynamite concentration and lovely black fruit and earthy aromas. Precise on the palate but also big and muscular, with silky tannins, grip and a late rush of deftly applied French oak. Delicious and a fine reflection of the Uco Valley, Argentina's top Malbec region.",Malbec
Argentina,"Little by little Trapiche is improving its Pinot Noirs, evidenced by this authentic, lightly perfumed wine. It's fresh, bearing good acidity and roasted berry and leaf flavors. It finishes with mild tomato and herb accents. This gets better with time in the glass.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Dusty berry and plum aromas set the stage for a big, cheek-grabbing wine with red berry, leather and light herb flavors. Toasty and minty, this finishes with a touch of spice. This is a good blend of 60% Mal­bec and 40% Merlot.",Malbec-Merlot
Argentina,"Sweet and frothy, and made quite close to the Moscato style, meaning the nose is full of flowers and lime. The palate is a mix of crushed children's vitamins, mango and ripe melon.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Not nearly as intense and Cab-like as the 2003. For whatever reason, this vintage is bouncy and light, with a touch of smoked meat and rubber but mostly simple raspberry and cherry flavors. The feel borders on jammy, and it finishes with a touch of chocolate but also kind of herbal.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Despite some warm earth and compost on the nose, this shows positives such as solid cherry, plum and blackberry flavors. It opens on the midpalate but then thins out rather drastically on the finish. Like most in its class, it's hard Bonarda; but it has its merits, too.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Plenty of smoky oak on the nose, which leads to a mildly lactic influence on the palate. Other than that minor flaw, the wine settles to show resiny black fruit, firm tannins and a finish of vanilla and mocha. Grabby and extracted, but like so many Argentine Malbecs from 2005, it lacks the exuberant flavors and cushioned body that has made the categeory what it is today.",Malbec
Argentina,"With a hint of prune to the nose and some cheesy oak, the red flags go up. But in the mouth, the wine shows good berry and cassis flavors and admirable depth and length. Finishing notes of cassis and blackberry give it a good send-off. By no means exceptional but by all means a likable though slightly generic Cabernet.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A well-oaked wine with some modern touches. It's ripe and ready but not overdone; the flavors are of raspberry and light resin, but not much else. Like many 2005s, this Cab shows a subdued personality and less-than-expressive fruit. It's good and inoffensive, but it doesn't make you take notice.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This is dark, smoky and minty at first, turning more earthy, leathery and warm as it opens. It feels big and sort of tough, with smoked, roasted flavors of savory berry and rooty cola. It finishes tannic and rubbery.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Black as night, with aromas of leather, wild berries and wet dog. It is salty and oaky in the mouth, with vanilla and tannin but not a whole lot of ripe, lovable dark fruit. Gets better as it evolves, but where's the dark, sweet fruit to match the oak, tannins and tightness?",Bonarda
Argentina,"Quite piercing and fiery at first, which announces that it is fully oaked. Along the way there's savory notes, saucy leather and flashes of dark fruit. This would be a better wine with more fruit and flesh, and less barrel. The dill, vanilla and spice flavors are a bit too dominant.",Malbec
Argentina,"Like many wines from this vintage, Melipal seems afflicted with 2005 blues. It has black plum and some woody char to chew on, but also saline and frisky tartness. Gets better with airing and will show best with food, but it's clearly a step down from prior years.",Malbec
Argentina,"Yellowish to tan in color, this young wine is already showing signs of age, but get it early and you'll find creamy but sturdy flavors of squash, kumquat and peach. There's oak in support and plenty of personality. Whether that personality is universally appealing, however, is doubtful.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Excellent Malbec at a very good price. Ripe, big, burly and a powder keg of alluring cassis, licorice and inky aromas. Rich, stout and smooth in the mouth, with generous black cherry, baked plum, coffee and chocolate flavors and finishing notes. Pure as can be; drink now through 2012.",Malbec
Argentina,"The nose offers a fine mix of floral berry, dusty earth and classic Malbec richness, while the palate is juicy, balanced and tastes of cassis, blackberry, fresh plum, cracked pepper and baking spices. Full and long on the finish, and overall it's right where you want it to be. Drink now through 2011.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is earthy, rubbery and big on the nose, which isn't unusual for Bonarda. The tannins clamp down on the palate, tasting roasted, with hickory and smoked meat flavors sticking out. It's dense but not very active on the finish.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Dark and minty smelling, this bears hints of blackberry, perfume and violet. It feels good and not too forceful, with regular Malbec flavors of dark fruit, red plum and spice. The finish is firm and slightly medicinal.",Malbec
Argentina,"Chunky, big and forward, with some fiery horseradish and spent campfire on the nose. Blackberry, wild raspberry and leather work the demanding, starchy palate, and the finish is short and generally clean and healthy.",Malbec
Argentina,"A fine wine from Septima, most likely with Malbec at its base (though the label says nothing of the sort). Aromas of blackberry, raspberry, perfume, pepper and asphalt are attractive, and the rooty richness and slight medicinality of the core flavors are unique but not out of focus. One of the winery's best wines to date.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Blackberry, black cherry, cola and a whole lot of attractive aromas get this dense, pure Malbec going in the right direction. Lush and delicious black fruit flavors lead the palate, which also bring cola and a dusting of pepper. Lighter on the finish than the start, with olive, vanilla and mild chocolate notes.",Malbec
Argentina,"Aromas of sandalwood, violets and berries give this one an elevated, magnetic nose, while the palate is lush, big and full of black fruit and masculine tannins. A dark, minerally style from high-elevation vineyards with a coating of vanilla and caramel on the long finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Strident aromas of licorice, herbs, berries and mint make it interesting, while the palate is light and fresh, with raspberry and red currant flavors. There's not a lot of heft, extract or depth to the wine, but it's likable and unhindered by excess oak and such. Enjoyable due to its unchallenging simplicity.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Round, nutty and smooth, with melon, citrus and apple flavors. In this wine's case, organic does not equal complexity. That said, what's here is clean and balanced, and there's more than enough fruit and intensity to satisfy.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Given the dearth of good Argentinean rosés on the market, this one from Cafayate (based on Malbec) is pretty tasty, balanced and interesting. The nose is succulent and not offputting, while the palate shows fresh red apple, cherry and length to the finish. Not complicated but racy and clean.",Malbec
Argentina,"Black fruit, leather and licorice aromas are draped all over this heavyweight Cabernet Franc. It feels tannic, with aggressive flavors of bullish black fruit. This is flavorful at every point, but hard and abrasive in feel.",Cabernet Franc
Argentina,"Olive, blackberry and toasty oak all give hope, but when this wine crosses the palate the acidity is so intense that it causes you to take count of your cheeks, tongue and teeth. On one hand, there's blackberry and cassis flavors to enjoy; on the other, the mouthfeel leaves you roughed up. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",Malbec
Argentina,"Nice and pure, with controlled berry aromas, a dash of pepper and integrated background oak. A tasty, easy-to-drink wine with fine balance and fresh flavors of cherry, raspberry, cassis, chocolate and a medicinal finish. Good depth, length and size throughout. Delicious Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Neutral for the most part, but this light-framed white slips in pear, orange and spice notes while maintaining a nice, juicy profile. Nothing more than a refreshing, lime-infused dandy. But what's wrong with that?",Torrontés
Argentina,"Earthy and seemingly on the edge of being overripe, this is a wine that deals dark-fruit flavors, a milky, malty underlay, and a fairly sound mouthfeel. Ample tannins and resiny, peppery afternotes re-announce any previously detected oak, and like many wines from this vintage it's overly expressive.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Concentrated and intense, but typical of Bonarda this is a fierce wine with a rock-hard mouthfeel and slightly tart, limited raspberry flavors. Not exactly sour but it makes your mouth seize up and take notice.",Bonarda
Argentina,"We haven't seen much improvement in this wine since the 2003 vintage. It's still lacking forward, ripe fruit and instead shows more leather and drying, firm tannins. Shows glimpses of higher quality but can't support them.",Malbec
Argentina,"Popcorn, green-apple and scallion aromas precede crisp, tart flavors of barely ripe peach and grapefruit. The finish is short and citrusy, boosted by choppy acids. Racy but not rich.",Champagne Blend
Argentina,"Malbec seems like the best bet for this organic label, which has shown some shaky wines alongside this. Even this one has a mild lactic, pasty streak to the nose along with raspberry and peppery spice. Lacks the cuddle and depth of the better Argentine Malbecs.",Malbec
Argentina,"Short on berries and jam and heavily oaked, thus fruit plays second fiddle to oak spice, spearmint and hard cinnamon on the nose. The palate is on the brambly side, while the finish is fairly long and a bit leathery. Has body and size but lacks the fine points.",Malbec
Argentina,"A bright purple luster draws you in, and the nose is bright, clean, focused and full of wild blackberry. Balanced in the mouth, with size and tannin but plenty of acidity and fruit. Tastes of blackberry, vanilla cream, molasses and spice, and the finish brings it on home. Sincere and excellent for the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"Purple in color, with ripe, meaty, earthy aromas mixed with herbs, exotic berry fruit scents and vanilla. This is feisty and full-bodied Pinot with integrated plum, blueberry and well-applied oak. It's a little more citrusy and zesty than in previous vintages, and definitely a heavier style than its Cincuenta y Cinco counterpart, which will allow it to age for another four to seven years.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Rather sweet and medicinal; the wine comes into form on the palate, which is fairly bright and forward as it pushes raspberry and cherry flavors. Acidity is on the high side, so the feel and finish have some burn. Could use some pizza or meat to help it along.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Timing is everything with this full-bodied PG. Get at it right away and it will still be almost viscous, but it should also show ripe tropical fruit flavors, core acidity and lots of personality. Just don't let it hang around for long, especially not at room temperature.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Light, floral and somewhat out of the mold. Flavors of apricot, peach and mango are both fresh and fleshy, while the finish lingers for quite some time. Fairly forceful but restrained enough.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Jumbled and jumpy on the nose, which struggles to find itself. Time gives this wine a chance to strut, and while it doesn't ever find a great groove it does offer youthful plum and berry flavors followed by resiny tannins. A little too scattered and pocked to rate better.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pleasant and fairly clean for the price, with hazelnut, honey and a dusting of talcum powder on the nose. The palate is on the thin side, and that helps the wine stay fresh and manageable. And along the way the flavors of apple, kiwi and gooseberry are relaxed and easy.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"This smells roasted, leathery and earthy, with a mouthfeel that's solid if a bit scratchy. It delivers an intense wild-berry aroma and some of Cafayate's signature complex herbal character. Oaky vanilla and dill notes accent the finish.",Barbera
Argentina,"Sweet and reduced aromas of red licorice and prune lead to sketchy red cherry flavors and not much body. The wine is closed, hard and chewy, but with a lot of fruit-forward potency.",Malbec
Argentina,"Herbal aromas infiltrate the nose, and the palate features midlevel red fruit with a strong herbal edge. The finish shows saline, chocolate and pepper, and never does it rise much above struggling.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Burnt popcorn and some ammonia make the nose fairly harsh. Time softens it a bit as it yields to green-fruit flavors. Finishes dry as a soda cracker, with some Old World touches. Not an easy wine to enjoy; it's very lean and underdeveloped.",Sparkling Blend
Argentina,"Big and spicy at first, and then vegetal, lesser characteristics seep in and take over. The palate has baked black fruit and a finish of bitter chocolate and pepper, but also some rooty, bark-like issues. There's no point of focus to this wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Very nice Malbec from vines with up to 80 years of age. The nose is briary, earthy and deep, with purity and power. And the palate is juicy, lively and packs enticing flavors of plum, blackberry, cured meat and vanilla. Warming, ripe stuff. Delicious and ready to drink.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lagarde regularly makes consistent, true wines and this Cab is compact, solid and smooth, with spice and a lot of berry fruit on the nose. Refined, deep and pure on the palate, with blackberry, marzipan and licorice flavors. Very nice Argentine Cabernet for the money. Drink now into 2011.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Spritzy lemon-lime aromas are attractive; there's lemon meringue and green herbs on the palate, and a narrow, fresh finish to close the deal.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Stocked with color and earthy, oaky aromas. This is not a shy wine, which doesn't make it polished or deft. Instead, it's a beefy, extracted number with midlevel dark fruit followed by plenty of forced, chocolaty oak. Big in stature with no likelihood of improving.",Shiraz
Argentina,"Far less ripe and appealing than the 2004 version. The '05 comes out of the chute smelling malty and lactic; airing reveals strawberry milk notes, while the flavors struggle to express themselves. Sticky, oily and as if someone hit the mute button along the way. Where's the ripe, lush quality we've come to love about Argentinean Malbec?",Malbec
Argentina,"Both stewy and sweet on the nose. The palate is brawny and unctuous, with big berry fruit getting gobbled up by the wine's grabby, tannic structure. This is wild, rubbery, young Cab. Air it out and serve at your barbecue.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This mildly prickly, red-fruit dominated Malbec is perfectly drinkable. The nose is drying, while the palate shows red cherries and raspberry along with some forceful buttery oak. Reasonably long on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Earthy and warm on the nose, this has compost and leafy raspberry aromas. It shows good feel and balance, with light plum, cherry and citrus-infused tea flavors. The finish is good and solid, concluding with a tobacco note.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Leafy and smoky smelling, this has lean cherry and raspberry aromas in the backdrop. This is a tight and linear wine, with strawberry and raspberry flavors that pick up speed. Overall it's juicy, jumpy and legit, but nervy. This may benefit from more bottle aging. Only 512 cases were produced.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Briary berry aromas have a modest but welcome rooty, medicinal accent, while the palate is aggressive, ripe and offers the right framework for sweet berry and plum flavors. Pure and clean on the finish, with mocha and root beer notes. High-quality Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Interesting Malbec with character and individuality. The nose is savory and smoky, with spice and floral aromas. Full and ripe in the mouth, where roasted black fruit, clove, spice and cola all make a showing. Textured and sizable late, with a coffee note to the finish. Drink now through 2011.",Malbec
Argentina,"One of Altocedro's better efforts starts with meaty, ripe, chunky black fruit aromas and a wave of mocha, cocoa and berry syrup. It's a creamy specimen but has enough acidity and vitality to not run flat. Mocha, carob and plum extend through the finish. Drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"A bit heavy and sweet, with big lemon-lime aromas followed by cloying pear and mango flavors. It's more creamy and sticky than desirable, but the core flavors are admirable and you can't take issue with its purity. Would be better if it were more agile.",Torrontés
Argentina,"A pretty good red for those on a budget. The nose falls into the generic but pleasant raspberry and cherry realm, while the feel and flavors are of mouthfilling, mostly clean red fruit. No real varietal character but a good enough red wine.",Shiraz
Argentina,"Juicy and jumpy on the nose, but not sour. The palate of this dark, almost red Malbec rosé is sweet and candied but also zesty due to pretty lively acids. It's not a stellar wine but it is full of berries and spunk.",Malbec
Argentina,"Leathery berry aromas are earthy and suggest notes of cured meat and cheese. It gets tougher and more tannic the more it breathes, with black fruit, herb and spice flavors. Generous but rough in feel, it has a powerful, medium-long finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"The fresh berry aromas are solid, and the palate is plucky and lively, with plenty of acidity to push the ripe, standard Malbec flavors of blackberry and spice. It shows some tartaric crispness and bite on the finish, but tastes right.",Malbec
Argentina,"Hard, minty, oaky and even a touch chemical on the nose, then tough as nails in the mouth. Tastes resiny and minty, with black fruit flavors and extreme tannic clamp. Chocolaty tasting on the finish, which retains the wine's hard personality. Tasted twice.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Opens with warm, woody aromas that fold in molasses and maple along with mildly baked berry fruit. The palate is alert but balanced, with proper acidity pumping up cherry, plum and snappy berry flavors. Buttery notes and toffee warm the finish, which keeps its poise.",Malbec
Argentina,"Aromas of rose hips, tomato leaf, raisin and black cherry get this fuller-bodied Pinot going on its way to a chunky palate of ripe raspberry, plum and creamy oak. There's length and a smooth mouthfeel, and it avoids common New World pot holes like faux butter or popcorn-like flavors. Drink now.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Round and saturated on the nose, with a baked, syrupy set of dark-fruit aromas. The palate is plump but offers proper acidity, and thus the flavors of cola, mocha and blackberry are round but balanced. Buttery oak comes up on the finish, and overall this is a tasty but somewhat regular high-end Malbec (with 34% Tempranillo).",Malbec-Tempranillo
Argentina,"The bouquet resembles fresh apple cider. There's more apple and the addition of citrus on the palate, while the finish is ripe, fruity and soft. More chunky than upright.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Plump and soft up front, with limited aromas of honeysuckle and baked pears. The body is full and low on acids, so the flavors are chunky and the feel is cushioned. Drink now for best results; the future of this wine isn't that bright.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Certain Argentine wines have a rustic, foxy character to them that reminds us that winemaking isn't a factory-proven science. This fits the bill; it's murky and sharp on the nose, with brambly raspberry sitting in wait. Feelwise, it's a bit too piercing and choppy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Too heavy, murky and pruney on the nose; this wine has a lot of size but little freshness. It's big and bust-out, but with no direction or finesse it comes across earthy and oily. Only 250 cases made.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Decidedly brambly, with murky aromas mixed with rhubarb and pepper. The palate has a chunky, decent feel to it, but the flavors follow the nose: they are choppy and peppery. Meets all the standards of an acceptable wine, but could be much riper and more generous given its provenance.",Malbec
Argentina,"This has apple and nectarine aromas that are a touch briny. It shows good acidity and mouthfeel, with flavors of apple, peach and even some green bean.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Black fruit aromas come with a dusty note and a hint of milk chocolate. This feels straightforward, with flavors of raspberry, mild herb and sugar beet. The finish is short and easy, with an approachable mouthfeel.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tropical and friendly, this feels a little bulky and chunky, but with enough acidity for balance. Flavors of citrus and mango are medium intense, while the finish is soft. Drink soon.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Praise before criticism, and we like the wine's stocky body, bright color and mouthfeel. In those categories, it's a high flier. But there's also a briny, pickled accent to the nose and accents of olive, rhubarb and herbaceousness. Interesting in that it differs greatly from Alta Vista's Temis.",Malbec
Argentina,"Warm, rich aromas of wild berry carry a hint of dried cheese, while the rest of the bouquet is woodsy and spicy. The palate is juicy with fresh acidity, and the flavors of red plum and raspberry are solid. A structured wine with good DNA. Drink now through 2011.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"From 83-year-old vines, this is an opaque wine with pastry/graham cracker aromas and a little bit of leather and funk. The palate has hard-hitting, cheek-slapping tannins and dense but herbal plum, blackberry and salinic flavors. It's not elegant or sleek, but it is big, thick and makes its point.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cherry, cough drop, mineral, heat and red licorice on the nose, with medicinal raspberry and plum flavors. Snappy and fresh in the mouth, with a rooty finish touched up by vanilla. Flavorful and properly executed, with a slight intrusion of cherry cough medicine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Most of the Toso wines are screaming successes, but this Syrah is mostly an amalgamation of extract and lots of oak. The wine smells like blackberry syrup caked with mocha, while the flavors and feel are limited except for the barrel notes. As Syrah goes, this doesn't deliver much finesse; just weight and wood.",Syrah
Argentina,"Incongruous but with good intentions. The nose features cherry LifeSaver aromas but also hints of cheese and leather. The palate is modest and fairly acute as it delivers tangy, stretched-out plum and raspberry flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"Better at first, when it gives green aromas and a lightness of being. But the palate runs kind of heavy, and the more you taste the heavier it gets. Soon pickle and tarragon come into play, and by then you're longing for a lighter, cleaner wine.",Torrontés
Argentina,"An aromatic dose of vinegar and rhubarb tempers expectations, and on the palate there's really nothing more than juicy, anonymous fruit and a hang-around finish. Adequate but no competition for a Mediterranean dry rosé.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is oakier and more expensive than prior Trapiche Chardonnays, but it's not necessarily better. It smells like a rubber band and a barrel, bearing resiny flavors of mango and melon, with lots of sweet oak and vanilla tones.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Oyster shell and matchstick aromas come with distant peach and melon notes. Feels good but rudimentary, with peach and papaya flavors that end soft and easy. Drink this immediately for maximum zest and freshness.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"A touch of minerality on the nose comes with apple and lemon aromas. It feels fleshy, with pulpy white-fruit flavors that end with honeydew and papaya notes. Drink now.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"The nose opens with animalistic scents of leather, compost and barnyard. This has an average mouthfeel, with somewhat herbal plum and berry flavors that finish short with a mild leafy character.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Clean, straightforward aromas of berry, cassis and mineral are nice, while the palate has ample lushness, purity and focus. Flavors of cola, black currant and blackberry are solid, and the finish keeps its pose. On the money for a regular, journeyman's Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"A nice Torrontés with good muscat-like aromas along with a blast or orange blossom. The palate has weight, roundness and good, true flavors of lemon, orange and melon. Long and rock-solid on the finish, with focus throughout. Drink soon.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Fresh, inviting raspberry, strawberry and tempered vanilla aromas set up a snappy, equally fresh palate of cherry and raspberry. There's no excess heft, beef, extract or color to this wine; it's restrained but not miserly. And it finishes crisp and flashy. Well made and likely good with food.",Malbec
Argentina,"A nose highly suggestive of green olives leads to a palate defined by sharp plum and berry flavors and a salinic, grating finish. There isn't much sweetness and character, hence it's very limited.",Syrah
Argentina,"Funky, off-base floral aromas and a sweet, cotton candy flavor profile. Feels flat and sugary to the end, with a nip of bitter almond.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"A heavy, nutty Chard. Mealy citrus and peach flavors carry the palate to a flat, uninspiring finish. Ripe but not well balanced.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Brambly on the nose, with equally challenging and drying flavors of cranberry and rhubarb. There's very little to say about this stripped-down Cabernet other than that it's generally clean and not brutally offensive.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Apple and white fruit aromas set up a balanced, reasonably full palate, with banana, creamy oak, vanilla and apple flavors. It feels solid and round, with a clean finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"This is neutral on the nose except for green banana and white grapefruit hints. It feels melony, with flavors that match the mouthfeel in the form of melon and nectarine. This is flabby on the finish, needing more cut and zest.",Torrontés
Argentina,"A lot of oak hits hard, with initial scents of shoe polish and black tar. This is rubbery, big and forward stuff, with loud plum, berry, toast and oak flavors. The finish stays minty, toasty and slightly bitter.",Malbec
Argentina,"Hot and crusty smelling at first blush and then the nose turns to mocha and smoky berry. Good mouthfeel, rich and balanced, with a fresh quality as well. Solid, complete red wine with a nice berry-packed Merlot character.",Merlot
Argentina,"Spunky dark fruit aromas open the show, with leather, cheese and mocha coming in later. The palate is a little grabby and acidic, but the juicy flavors of plum, wild berry, citrus and cassis are good. Finishes with some bounce in its step due to full acidity, and overall it maintains freshness and zest. Malbec with smaller doses of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Merlot.",Red Blend
Argentina,"The 2008 Noemía wines all seem a little sedate and short compared to prior years. This wine is dark, crusty and tarry on the nose, with requisite black fruit and a slightly soupy quality. The palate is full and chewy, with medium-intensity black fruit and chocolate flavors. Finishes short, without much velocity.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big and black, with aromas of tar, blackberry and black olive. The palate, however, is snappy and pleasantly fresh, with lively cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. Tight, balanced, competent and nice, with a smear of chocolate on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Full and overly chunky, but ultimately off-kilter. Too sweet and gummy.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Strangely colored, with oyster shell aromas and weird orange-influenced flavors. Not exactly sweet but not dry either, this is borderline wine made from Cabernet and Malbec. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,Angular and overcrowded with rhubarb aromas and flavors. There isn't any finesse to this wine and only a modicum of acceptable fruit and body. Tart at the core.,Syrah
Argentina,"Nothing more than cherry soda aromas to get it going. It's highly confected, with decent acidity its only saving grace.",Malbec
Argentina,"An opening of lightly baked black fruit aromas and graham cracker is pleasant and ready, while the palate has size, a cushioned feel and herbal, spicy berry flavors and a swatch of oak on the back end. With oak and toast on the finish, it comes to a nice conclusion. Good Malbec with some pedigree.",Malbec
Argentina,"Different than most, with reduced, rubbery aromas that also bring graphite and olive into play. Very thick and syrupy in the mouth, with low acidity leading to chewy plum and blackberry flavors. Licorice and baked fruit notes control the finish, which is short and chunky. Ready to drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"A little heat early on, and also aromas of pepper, fresh fallen leaves and dry berry fruit. It's more traditional in style, meaning it isn't pitch black, sweet and thick. Instead the wine shows earthy, mature flavors of fig paste, raspberry and cough drop. More competent than flashy.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This smells a bit oily and like a match, with additional aromas of white fruits and corn flakes. It feels pulpy but just crisp enough, with pithy grapefruit and sweet papaya flavors. It tastes candied on the finish.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"This is briny and oily on the nose, with grapefruit aromas. It feels citrusy in the mouth, with bitter nut and citrus flavors that turn pithy and more briny on the finish.",Pedro Ximénez
Argentina,"Mild varnish and lacquer aromas stem from the oak influence, and there's not a lot of fruit to offset those notes. It feels plump and a bit clumsy, with briny citrus flavors leading to a pickled, resiny finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Jammy strawberry aromas are alluring but light, which suggests more of an Old World style compared to most of the beefy, brawny Malbecs out there today. The palate is crisp and agile, with light-framed raspberry flavors. More elegant than hefty, but also a little hollow on the midpalate and finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"A gritty but well-made wine with aromas of crushed brick, red pepper flake, earth and sandalwood. The palate is tightly wound and mildly tannic, with semisweet flavors of black plum, fig, black cherry and chocolate. Shows a medicinal edge on the finsih, but nothing too drastic.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dark and saturated to the eye, and powerful on the nose. In the mouth, the flavors of raspberry and plum are solid, while overall the wine is full and stocky but short on complexity and uniqueness. Well executed but highly regular for an upper-shelf Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Quite the woody wine, with aromas of sawmill, cracked pepper, black licorice and dark fruit. The palate has a healthy feel to it, with integrated acidity that props up the oak-infused wild berry and herb flavors that dominate. Finishes with another wave of spicy, raw oak.",Malbec
Argentina,"Somewhat murky and smelling of compost and green berry fruit. Feels full and wide, with a hard palate containing milk chocolate and molasses flavors. Finishes bitter, dark and herbal, with gripping tannins. Tasted twice.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Meaty plum and berry aromas come with dark, demanding, minty aromas that are similar to this winery's Lote 44 bottling. It feels astringent, with a resiny oak tone and flavors of raspberry, chocolate and grainy wood.",Malbec
Argentina,"Papaya, lime and peach aromas are basic but clean. The palate, too, feels basic and clean. Flavors of orange and citrus pith lead to a fleshy, sweet-tasting finish.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Raspy cherry aromas precede a scratchy palate that's characterized by its high acid-to-body ratio. It tastes a bit tart and generic, with a red plum flavor in front of a fiery finish. This is light and crisp in style.",Malbec-Merlot
Argentina,"This smells rubbery and like cured meat, and it's not very fruity. It clunks across the palate with squeaky tannins, a lot of weight and foresty, herbal plum flavors.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Spearmint and soft berry aromas turn toward raisin. This feels wide and flabby, with a lot of oak and resin notes in its frame. This is quite oaky, spicy and minty for Pinot Noir.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"A green and herbal style of northern Argentine Cabernet Sauvignon, this smells like tobacco, green bean, bell pepper and oregano. Quite tannic in feel, it bears a roasted herb flavor, finishing savory but green.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Nice from the get-go, with lime, citrus and fresh herb aromas. The palate is round and whole, with easygoing flavors of lemon, mango, papaya and melon. Fresh and pleasant on the finish, and perfect for aperitifs.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Mossy and quite woody, and maybe even bretty, but also rich and stout, with concentration. Aromas of cheesey black fruit are staunch, while the round palate has richness, thickness and flavors of molasses, baked berries and licorice. Finishes surprisingly quick.",Malbec
Argentina,"Recent ratings have been consistent for this pricey Malbec-Petit Verdot-Tannat blend. The nose is woody and the fruit seems baked, and along the route you encounter a cheesy, horsey quality. Thick on the palate, with good structure and buttery flavors of strawberry and raspberry. Doesn't bring it all together, but the parts have their virtues.",Red Blend
Argentina,"After light scents of butter and spiced apple surface, the wine turns briny and pickled, both in aromas and flavors. It feels fleshy on the finish, with briny stone-fruit and citrus flavors.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Mellow and melony up front, with a plump, bland palate featuring mealy melon and peach flavors. The finish has a touch of bitterness.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Oily and mustardy on the nose, then inconistent and not real clear on the palate. It tastes like briny melon and apricot, turning a bit flat on the finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Extremely herbal and vegetal, this is also saturated and syrupy on the palate. Flavors of green bean, mushroom, tomato paste and baked berry are undeniable. It hints at something better but requires too much patience to find it.",Cabernet Franc
Argentina,"Nervy plum and wet-dog aromas set up a firm palate that's herbal tasting. Licorice, medicinal berry and green notes surface on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with rich, broad, semiroasted aromas of black fruit, rubber and earth. The palate is basic and mildly tannic, with black plum, baked berry and mild herbal flavors. Has a syrupy profile on one hand, but tannic bite keeps it on course. Tastes good as it gets the job done.",Malbec
Argentina,"Bright but spotty on the nose, with salinic red fruit aromas that are one part raspberry and one part pool water. The palate is in the narrow, tannic field but the flavors are good, with blackberry, bitter chocolate and generic darkness working the the palate and finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sweet aromas of berry syrup give the wine steam and weight heading into a thick, chewy palate of baked berry, candy, vanilla and buttery flavors. Syrupy and creamy, but also a bit lactic on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Textbook Malbec with a nice, modern package. Solid as you'd expect, with plum/berry aromas, a hint of cherry candy and then a drawn, mildly saucy palate of red fruit. Good mouthfeel, nothing abrasive, and competent on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Nicely put together but totally generic, as if it were sent from the central casting dept. The nose has some rubber and smoke to go with black fruit, while the palate has good body and sweet black plum and berry flavors. Full enough but not baked or heavy.",Malbec
Argentina,"The lighter-style nose that focuses on red plum and cherry is a welcome change from all of the heavy Malbecs out there, but the wine doesn't follow through on the palate. It becomes astringent, with tastes of tomato, stewed berry and cranberry.",Malbec
Argentina,"Grapy and jammy smelling, this feels narrow and high in acid, bearing plum and tart cherry flavors that turn more sour with time. The finish is tomatoey and abrupt.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"The nonexpressive berry and cherry aromas are closed. Light in feel, this tastes of citrus, plum and rhubarb. The lightweight finish is mildly herbal and green.",Malbec
Argentina,"A nutty apricot aroma marks the nose. It feels creamy and sticky, with sweet vanilla and baked fruit flavors. With time it turns more cloying.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"This smells like a forest fire, but it's also creamy and roasted. Tangy and tart, this features narrow plum and cherry flavors that are powered by blazing acidity.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Light on the nose, it feels tangy in the mouth, with sharp flavors of mustard, brine and lime. This finishes with a pickled flavor.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"This is not a consistent wine year to year. Some vintages are true and vital, but this is clunky, with flavors of honeyed white fruits and bitter almond skins.",Torrontés
Argentina,"While this smells floral and candied, the palate rages, courtesy of strapping acidity that creates tart plum and blueberry flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"Inviting raspberry and cherry aromas have a tiny level of volatility, while the palate is chunky, bold and edgy, with big berry flavors leading the way. Full on the finish, with some oak and vanilla to give it padding. Lively, full-bodied Cabernet that's pretty good in the long run.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Toasty, dark aromas set up a smooth, semirich palate of creamy berry flavors mixed with spice, vanilla and pepper. This wine won't take you to wonderland but it doesn't go off course, either. Good and tasty Merlot with more than adequate balance.",Merlot
Argentina,"This is saturated, flat and flabby on the nose, with pudgy blackberry aromas. It has a static, jammy mouthfeel, tasting overspiced and heavily oaked.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Floral, oily aromas are offset by the scents of lychee and lime. The palate is tropical and tasty, with peach, lychee and persistent freshness. It's getting a little heavy and lazy at this point in its development, but it's an honest reflection of northern Argentinean Torrontés.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Earthy, friendly berry aromas are good sbecause they don't overpower, and although the mouth is chunky and a little tannic and rubbery, the flavors are deep and ripe. Tarry and dark on the finish, with typical Bonarda weight.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Earthy, leathery aromas are front and center on the broad, beefy nose that also blends in dark fruits including blueberry. The palate is medium-bodied, with black cherry, blackberry and herbal flavors. Shows good feel and a solid, middle-of-the-road overall character.",Malbec
Argentina,"Shows peppy cherry, citrus and other short, angular aromatics, which is followed by a zesty red fruit flavor profile with a snappy mouthfeel. Dominated by cherry and raspberry, and on the finish there's mild buttery oak and carob. Good wine; distinctly tight and red fruited.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"For everyday consumption, this is good Cabernet with rousing fruit, body and pulse. The nose has smoke, rubber, pepper and cured meat to go with berry and cassis aromas, and the palate is very fruity, driving and loaded with flavorful cherry, raspberry and plum fruit. Not refined but good and honest.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Argentino is a Malbec made from two vineyards: Adrianna in Tupungato and Nicasia in Vista Flores/Altamira. Aged for two years in new oak, it's a dark, vibrant masculine wine with excellent depth of flavor, seductive berry flavors, and lots of length. It hits with force but also finesse, and it shows the extracted richness that comes from small-lot open bin fermentation.",Malbec
Argentina,"Talk about a deep, luscious wine. The bouquet emits a magnetic blend of chocolate cake, fine leather and berry marmalade, while the midsection is downright delicious but also very pure and natural despite the wine seeing 20 months of new oak. ACrux catches and holds every note, and it should age well for another 5 to 8 years.",Malbec
Argentina,"A big, floral, fruity wine with all the hallmarks of excellence. The fruit is exacting, ripe and healthy, the tannins are firm, and the acidity is just right. It avoids all pitfalls as it transitions well from nose to palate to finish. Lots of fruit to ponder, then coffee, spice and chocolate at the end.",Malbec
Argentina,"More floral and blueberry driven than Bousquet's regular Merlot from '07 but not discernibly better or worse. The palate is round and the balance and feel are good. Flavors of floral blueberry follow the bouquet, and the finish shows a dash of sweet berry syrup and chocolate.",Merlot
Argentina,"Slightly minty at first, with resiny oak, berry and mild leafy aromas. Things fall into line with airing, and the palate of savory, barrel-accented berry fruit is mildly herbal but solid. A little drying and leafy but pretty good overall.",Malbec
Argentina,"A lot of barrel toast and butterscotch on the nose, and also baked apple and roasted nuts. Pretty good texture, balance and acidity, with flavors of pear, banana and walnut. Long and nutty finish, with warmth and a touch of vanilla.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Roll out the barrel as far as aromas go; it's got a lot of toast and popcorn. The palate is creamy and smooth, with apple, peach and a fairly high level of sweetness. Regular on the finish, with some leftover popcorn and spiced apple.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Sweet it is, but given the price it is good wine with mass appeal. Apple, pear and mellow citrus aromas and flavors feature zero funk or mealy character, and the finish offers a dab of butterscotch. Shows mild residual sugar but many consumers will like that.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Racy cherry and red berry aromas are salinic and light, while the palate is lean and revolves around tangy, citrusy red-fruit flavors. Fresh and a little rubbery on the finish, with a tight, singular personality.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Never in its young history has the Clos 7 blend tasted this good right away. The '06 shows excellent young aromas of charcoal, black pepper and blackberry. The palate preserves that pepper and coffee blackness as it strides across ripe, satisfying blackberry and cassis flavors. It's 45% Malbec and then smaller amounts of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. Made by Michel Rolland and the other owners of the Clos de los Siete vineyards.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Adrianna sits at 5,000 feet, making it one of the highest vineyards in all of Mendoza. The wine shows pure Tupungato mountain fruit, with deep chocolaty undertones and lots of fine, toasty French oak. For deep berry flavors and smoothness more than rough and tough, Adrianna is on the money. Drink now through 2011.",Malbec
Argentina,"One of the most untouched, terroir-driven Malbecs made in Argentina is Achaval-Ferrer's Altamira. It's harvested about three weeks earlier than most high-end fruit, resulting in core raspberry flavors and a certain redness of character. The wine is unfined and cloudy but still very clear on the palate, with length, power and class. Best from 2009–2012.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big but flat, with soft aromas of baked plum and fall leaves. The palate is all brown sugar, caramel, chocolate and rich but hard to find black fruit, while the finish is sweet like milk chocolate and toffee. Decent wine but definitely soft and syrupy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fresh and chalky Torrontés with lemon peel and green banana aromas sitting in front of melon, mango and citrus flavors. Not overpowering or acidic, but clean and healthy. Drink right away for maximum freshness and character.",Torrontés
Argentina,"In the limited but challenged world of Argentinean Viognier, this one is pretty good. It's a touch oily and pickled, but that's a varietal trait and a reflection of warm terroir more than a fault. Flavors of citrus, pineapple and mango are solid, while the orange blossom character helps give it lift.",Viognier
Argentina,"A strange set of aromas makes for an unusual bouquet: violets, black cherry, flower-scented air freshener and blueberry are all part of the picture. The palate is superficial and not real deep, with candied, unconventional flavors of herbal berry and candy. Finishes jammy and off the grid.",Malbec
Argentina,"Typical of a Patagonian red, the profile of this Merlot is fresh, racy and snappy, Red fruit and black pepper aromas get it going, while the cherry and raspberry flavors are crisp and forward. Solid but generic red wine.",Merlot
Argentina,"Light and slightly soapy smelling, with lychee notes. The palate is full and round, with warm flavors of tangerine and lychee. Finishes with heft, smooth edges and sweetness, and overall it weighs in as a heavyweight Torrontés that might hit the mat hard when it fades.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Colorful but low in pulse, with jammy, pasty aromas sitting in front of a bulky, one-dimensional palate that offers standard blackberry fruit and mildly herbal side flavors. Has just enough acidity to keep it pumping, but as a whole it comes across a little too heavy and jammy compared to previous years.",Malbec
Argentina,"Aromas of tree bark and rooty fruit are balanced by floral notes, while the palate is angular and juicy, with acid-propelled berry and mild citrus flavors. Jumpy, fresh and tomatoey on the finish. Could use more bulk, darkness and concentration; seems sort of dilute and high-acid.",Malbec
Argentina,"Since we last tried this wine, Catena has dialed back the new oak and pumped up the natural acidity. And the result is pleasantly akin to fine Burgundy. Now the emphasis is on refined, Dijon-style apple and peach flavors with great mouthfeel. Drink now.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A studly Malbec sourced from the Altamira section of the Uco Valley, then aged 18 months in new French oak. Much of this wine is fermented in plastic bins (not tanks), and the affiliated intensity grabs your attention. The blackberry flavors are potent and backed by heavy chocolate and toast. Lots of mouthfeel and power, with tannic grab. This wine can age several more years.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big-format Malbec is what we're calling this new 15.5% wine from Benjamin de Rothschild and Laurent Dassault, original partners in Michel Rolland's Clos de los Siete project. Round, lush and full of body, Flechas shows muscle but little fat. It's colorful, dark, full of black fruit and long on the finish. It is modern Malbec done for modern palates.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sweet, ripe, smooth and serious: this is top-shelf Malbec the way it should be. The bouquet is deep and brawny, with very ripe but balanced berry and toast aromas. Plum, blackberry and chocolate flavors are expansive and head straight to a fine finish that's lengthy and rock solid. Best now into 2010.",Malbec
Argentina,"A little toasty but not too much, with apple, pear and other standard New World aromas. The palate is smooth, tropical and easygoing, with buttery, warm flavors of melon and apple. Holds it together on the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A grabby wine with earthy/mulchy aromas, licorice and prune aromas. The palate has a balsamic character to the black cherry and dark plum flavors, and the finish is more of the same. Solid enough but it doesn't vary much or improve along the way.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with red fruit aromas that are like a million other generic red wines, while the body has size, grab and stickiness. Flavors of cola, cherry, cassis and plum are red in nature and basically good, while the finish is candied but not overly so. An everyman's Cabernet in every sense of the word.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Floral, white stone fruit aromas are sweet but generally attractive, while the lively palate is oily in feel but still fresh mostly due to youth. Lemon, apple and melon are the flavor components, while the finish is sweet almost to the point of being sugary, which is a detractor. Drink right away.",Viognier
Argentina,"Creamy dark-berry aromas carry a floral, blueberry hint, while the thick palate teeters on syrupy as it delivers gummy, mildly baked black fruit flavors. Lactic and full on the finish, with a touch of crusty bitterness along with milk chocolate and/or carob.",Malbec
Argentina,"Quite spicy, with the Syrah element offering a meaty, leathery quality that varietal Malbecs just don't have. The nose is rich, with some mocha giving it oaky warmth. the mouthfilling palate is packed with kirsch, cassis and blackberry, while the finish is smoky with some fiery heat. Needs another year or two to come together.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A lively, well-made blend of Tempranillo, Malbec and Syrah; B Crux is a bouncy, fresh youngster but still a serious wine with rock-solid black fruit, deep chocolate and spicy length. It's not super oaky as only half the wine sees new barrels, but you can definitely taste some wood. Will drink best in 2009–2010.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Trapiche's signature blend of Malbec and Merlot is at its best with this  bottling. The nose is smooth and deep as night, with a mix of black plum and light lemony aromas. The palate stands up as it accentuates plum and blackberry, while oak in the form of mocha and spice shows itself on the finish. A lively blend that should drink well through 2010 and beyond.",Merlot-Malbec
Argentina,"Andeluna's top wines tend to be ripe and plump, and so they come across as easy to drink and less demanding. This blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc is devoid of astringency and hard tannins. It's ripe, just a little rugged, and integrated such that the berry flavors are forward and don't need to fight to be appreciated.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Allow some of the muscled-up aromas of rubber and churned earth to blow off and what's left are true blackberry aromas and seductive plum, berry, coffee and cola flavors. This properly captures the essence of Mendoza Malbec; it's dark and tannic but honest and healthy. Drink now into 2010.",Malbec
Argentina,"Aromas of black fruit carry a light oak accent, and overall this is the type of Malbec that will earn more friends than detractors. Kind of hard and tannic in the mouth, with crisp black cherry and raspberry flavors. Clean but tough mouthfeel. Needs a burger or a slice of pizza to cut the tannins.",Malbec
Argentina,"Complete but not overly exciting. The nose has Malbec's basic black fruit and spice components, while the palate is a little high in acidity and sharpness, but also shows buttery oak and blackberry fruit. Fruity but oaky, with some excess tart acidity on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opening peach and apricot aromas are basic, while the plump palate has adequate freshness and flavors of butterscotch, banana and cream. Not a lot of fruit or verve, but round and friendly. Drink right away or wait for the '09.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Young and foxy Malbec with red fruit aromas and a little bit of wet dog. There's no shortage of freshness and pop on the palate, and the cherry and raspberry flavors are nothing if not racy. Shows a tasty, sweet side but also rudimentary raw materials.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pretty good blackberry aromas with an earthy, mulchy edge. Racy and typically rubbery in the mouth, with a muscular structure and herbal red fruit flavors. Very tight and like elastic on the finish. Has its good points with limits.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Compared to the regular 2006 Malbec from Chakana, this wine steps up in weight class and wins the crown. It's a serious but inviting red with spongey, ripe berry aromas topped by pure raspberry, cherry and cola flavors. It's both racy and composed, with a pile of bitter chocolate on the long finish. Good through 2009 at least.",Malbec
Argentina,"This dark, meaty Malbec has some Agrelo fruit in it but it's mostly from La Consulta and Vista Flores in the Uco Valley. Aged in new oak for 18 months, it smells rich, smooth and inviting, with asphalt, mineral, violet and coffee aromas. The palate has bold acidity and healthy flavors that settle on blackberry and dark chocolate. Drink now through 2011.",Malbec
Argentina,"There is a select group of under-$20 Malbecs from Argentina that really do the country and the variety proud. Santos is one of them; the 2006 is easy and ripe on the nose, with lovely cola, berry and herb aromas. The palate has a natural feel and bright black-fruit flavors. Not overly complex but a winner for the next year or two.",Malbec
Argentina,"Standard fare, with baked, rubbery aromas and a tarry undercurrent. The palate is dense and packed, with sweet, medicinal flavors of brandied cherries and cassis. Rubbery and leathery in terms of mouthfeel, with a roasted, reduced quality to the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Atypical on the nose, as air freshener, berry jelly and exotic but odd aromas take over. The palate seems superficial and wholly unusual, with floral blueberry flavors and then an angular, floral finish. Not terrible but doesn't seem much like Cabernet.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A little dusty and also sort of briney on the nose, with citric acidity pushing orange, apple and pear flavors. A textbook sweet, simple South American Chardonnay with a tropical leaning and finishing flavors of pineapple.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Fairly round aromas of blackberry are also slightly grapey, while the plump palate offers dark fruit flavors and a choppy mouthfeel. Finishes with a taste of powdered drink mix and grape bubblegum. Decent but shows all the signs of the large-production, commercial wine that it is.",Malbec
Argentina,"Floral blueberry aromas are candied, artificial smelling and sweet, and the palate is supremely rich, sweet, candied and unctuous. About as thick and ripe as you get in a value Malbec, but also over the top with baked fruit and candy. Needs to be dialed back a notch.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sweet apple aromas are probably the most defined thing coming off the innocuous nose, while the palate is forceful and citrusy, with jangly pineapple, peach and lemon flavors. Amplified white wine with a vague Viognier identity.",Viognier
Argentina,"Smells sweet and gummy, like a plum-flavored sucking candy or a piece of grape bubblegum. The palate is a bit punishing and hard, while wild blackberry, acidity and finishing oak make up the flavors. Lively but untamed.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Not as clean and fresh on the nose as it could be; instead pickle and barnyard notes enter the picture. It's better on the palate, which is sweet and sticky as it delivers chunky berry fruit flavors. Sort of cloying on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dusty and mild on the nose, with melony, sweet, tropical flavors. Easygoing on the palate, with decent verve and a fresh, simple, apple-based finish. Bright but basic Chardonnay from Argentina.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Fairly jumpy and foxy on the nose, but underneath you'll find zippy red fruit and gumball sweetness. The palate has a syrupy feel with decent tannins and a pedestrian structure. Tastes sweet, ripe and candied, with mild raisin on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Generic, solid aromas of medicinal raspberry and cherry lead to a gum-burning, tannic palate of rooty cherry and plum flavors. Finishes with verve but also stand-out acidity and grab. Regular in every way.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Opens with earthy muscle but the nose soon loses focus and freshness as it transitions to rubber and paste along with berry fruit. Hard tannins work the driving palate, while the flavors are of black plum, grape jelly and herbs. Decent but doesn't inspire.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sulfuric and gassy to start with, then tropical fruit and dusty aromas rise up. Like many varietal Torrontés, this has an oily feel and flavors of white peach, banana and nutmeg. Finishes somewhat flat and dilute, with mild bitterness.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Oily matchstick aromas run counter to the wine's innocuous color. The palate is light in weight but heavy in blossomy flavors of orange, lime, tangerine and other citrus fruits. Lacks the lychee/tropical quality that makes Torrontés special, and finishes bitter and pithy.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Roasted berry and plum aromas go counter to the wine's tough, tannic, semisour feel and flavor profile. Lean, a little choppy and tight in the mouth, with herbal cherry notes on the finish. Generic except for its hardness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Wayward and slightly weedy on the nose, with candied fruit notes that help it along. The palate is more acidic and rhubarby than ideal, although the tartness is offset by a creamy flavor of carob bean. Short and hot on the finish; acceptable but not well executed.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Fruity and earthy, with sly, narrow flavors of blackberry and chocolate. This has the ripeness and power that one would expect from a high-end Malbec, but also a bit more finesse and natural “redness” than many heavyweights from Argentina. Hints of herbs, pine, lemon peel and mocha grace the structured finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"If an intense style of Malbec is not your thing, then keep searching because this is intense in every way. The bouquet is dark and sun-drenched, with berry jam, leather and bacon aromas. The mouth shows huge blackberry, blueberry and black olive tastes, and the finish is warm and earthy, with espresso blackness. Shows every bit of its 14.9% alcohol but can handle it.",Malbec
Argentina,"A ripe, modern success with everything a fan of New World reds might want. The nose is floral and beautiful, with fine oak scents supporting brilliant raspberry, plum and spice aromas. It's deep, smooth and pressing in the mouth, with a delicious set of blackberry, coconut, vanilla and creamy flavors. A beauty to drink now through 2017.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Apple juice, brine and slightly sour smelling aromas, with an extremely soft palate of papaya and not much else. Finishes sweet, honeyed, flat and almondy. Seems to have already gone past its prime.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Baked, saucy and mildly burnt smelling, with a sweet, faux-chocolate edge to balance things out. The palate is bland and creamy, with milk chocolate, baked fruit and pepper flavors. Has thickness but is challenged in terms of taste and aromas.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Firm raspberry and cherry aromas, but nothing more, and then a tight, tough palate with syrupy, baked berry flavors and molasses. Turns mildly buttery on the finish, and always does it seem on the sweet and sticky side.",Malbec
Argentina,"Overdone aromas of candle wax, incense and air freshener show the musky side of the grape, while the palate is heavy with nectarine and citrus flavors. Finishes a little pithy and mealy, with a final wave of muskiness.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Aromas of apple cider are a touch acrid, while the palate is wet and easy but low in acidity. Flavors of melon and white fruits show some bitterness and break up in front of a flat finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Starts out short and dry on the nose, with little fruit character. The palate is also on the hard and lean side, with tart strawberry and raspberry flavors. Short but mild on the finish; fades away fast.",Merlot
Argentina,"Malbec with 30% Merlot; Numina starts off with dark mineral and crude oil aromas that give way to floral scents before flavors of cherry, blackberry, chocolate and pepper. There's a lot going on and overall this attempt at a high-end, powerful red blend is successful. It's much better balanced than many of Salentein's “bigger” wines, including Primus.",Malbec-Merlot
Argentina,"One sniff tells you plenty: there's attractive spice, coffee and leather to go with rich molasses and broad black-fruit aromas. The palate maintains balance due to fine, fresh acidity, and the flavor profile brings mocha, coffee, berry, plum and toast. Delicious, deep, layered and refined. Will age for at least 5–6 years, but best from 2012–2014.",Malbec
Argentina,"Very impressive for a blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot. Starts with a rich, bacony nose that brings cassis and blackberry, while the palate is saturated, big and layered, with wild raspberry, chocolate and spice flavors. It touches all the bases while maintaining a rich, almost syrupy mouthfeel. Drink now through 2014.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Excellent value in top-flight Malbec. In the four years that we've rated this wine, it hasn't dropped below 90 points. This vintage, with its deep, smooth luscious nose and dark black fruit flavors mixed with spice and chocolate, is the best Piedra Negra to date. A pure, delicious Malbec to drink now and over the next four years.",Malbec
Argentina,"A purple monster with lovely aromatics of campfire, mint, blackberry and spice. Very deep in the mouth, but not overweight or even slightly out of balance. The flavors are robust and pure, with an emphasis on black fruit, cassis and chocolate. And the finish brings nuances of cardamom, nutmeg and peppercorn. By far Goulart's epic wine. Drink now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fairly citrusy and lean for a reserve-level Malbec. The nose is short, high-toned and shows aromas of red fruits, citrus and even celery. The palate is fresh but tight and drying, with raspberry flavors and cherry skins and tomato on the finish. A red-dominant wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Mildly pickled red-fruit aromas fail to convey freshness or ripeness, and so it's no surprise that the core flavors are a bit herbal and briney. Decent mouthfeel helps it along, while the finish is short and borders on medicinal.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Smoke and earth notes vie with leather, olive, herbal scents and baked fruit aromas prior to a syrupy, sweet and cloying berry fruit palate. Lacks drive and spine as it comes across heavy, and the finish is syrupy and herbal, with a rubbery bite at the end.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with gravelly raspberry aromas and sour citrus notes. The palate is high in acidity, while the main flavors are black fruit, licorice and rubber. Licorice reappears on the finish, which is sweet but hard.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Rather flat and oily smelling, resulting in a low-pulse bouquet. The mouth is wet and chunky as it features sweet mango and cantaloupe flavors. Orange candy and sweetness is about all you get on the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Tart, lean red fruit aromas don't give much reason to plow forward, but if you do expect a high-acidity wine with a snappy mouthfeel and flavors of rhubarb, red plum and raspberry. Not much body or anything else, really.",Malbec
Argentina,"Earthy, deep and true to its Uco Valley roots; this is a very good and fairly serious Malbec that doesn't try to overstep its natural limitations. It's not too extracted or oaky but instead delivers robust blackberry, plum and caramel flavors backed by a warm, mildly oaky finish with menthol and mocha. Drink now into 2010.",Malbec
Argentina,"Full, chewy, doughy, spicy and intensely fruity. This single-vineyard Malbec offers a little bit of everything, and all in balanced, measured doses. The cherry and blackberry fruit is bold but pure, while chocolate comes in to darken things up. A textbook steak and potatoes wine with a bit of complexity, but mostly it's about easygoing fun.",Malbec
Argentina,"Since coming onto the scene with the 2002 vintage, this Chilean-run venture (Montes S.A.) has hit the right notes time after time. The 2005 Ultra is exactly as we've come to expect: It's saturated, dark, meaty and ripe, with huge blackberry flavors and lavish creamy oak. Very modern, but done in the right way.",Malbec
Argentina,"Deep, lush, balanced and oaky, with bacon, floral notes and huge raspberry and cassis aromas. Layered and structured across the palate, with concentration and balance to go with lusty cassis, blackberry, mocha and spice flavors. Finishes toasty and dark, with waves of espresso and mocha. Now–2015.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"It takes a few minutes to become friends with this bruising heavyweight from Mendoza's Uco Valley. It's muscular, tough, tannic and lemony now, but time will unleash a lovable, big-time Argentine blend with rustic notes along with pure, polished berry fruit and loads of earthy spice. Better to hold until at least 2011 before uncorking.",Red Blend
Argentina,"An intense Malbec-led marauder with rubbery black fruit aromas, spice and mile-deep ripeness. Pure, modern, beefy and purple, with rich black fruit flavors and also some sweeter blueberry notes. Finishes sizable but smooth. Drinkable now but better in a year. 70% Malbec with 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cab Franc.",Red Blend
Argentina,"An austere wine with candied cherry and citrus peel aromas. Inordinately hard and sharp in the mouth, with sour berry flavors and no soft spots. Exceedingly fresh and snappy, but a big step down from previous vintages.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Gaseous aromas include notes of animal, burnt meat and muddy earth. The palate is gummy and cloying, with sweet, syrupy flavors of candied fruit. Shows a weedy character and a jumbled persona.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Smells citric and green, with carob notes that seem artificial and forced. Very simple, creamy and candied, with faux chocolate flavors and sweet fruit. Finishes like a strawberry dipped in cheap chocolate. Modest quality at best.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A hint of orange escapes from an otherwise acrid, oily nose, while the flavors of nectarine, peach and lychee are pithy and bitter. Can't offer a whole lot of positives about this weird Viognier.",Viognier
Argentina,"Low intensity red fruit aromas are better than the sour orange peel and stemmy bramble that mar the wine's nose and core flavors. Tart, tight red wine with a narrow mouthfeel, tannic grab and rhubarb on the finish.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Narrow aromas of brick dust, tomato and dried fruits are none too impressive, and the sticky palate of sweet, baked, candied black fruit tastes more like molasses than anything. Gritty and burnt tasting on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Light, transparent and candied with underdeveloped, boring flavors and a mild chemical harshness. Barely worth a look. 40,000 cases produced.",Malbec
Argentina,"Generic, mealy, bland and flat banana aromas and flavors. Not so bad that you can't drink it but impossible to get excited about.",Viognier
Argentina,"An intense, forward style of Malbec. The nose oozes a mixture of mint, black-fruit extract and shoe polish, while the saturated palate is racy and just rich enough; the flavors of blackberry and plum are lively with coffee and mocha accents on the finish. A bit acidic and racy, but that won't hurt it if served with food.",Malbec
Argentina,"Roasted and meaty, with hints of raisin and licorice. The palate is ripe and chewy but balanced by solid tannins and fresh but natural acidity. And the flavors of blackberry, cassis and cola are true to the variety. Dense but approachable; drink now through 2009.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Malbec and Bonarda are the lead grapes in this four-variety blend that shows improvement from the 2004, which was tough. Loads of ripe, dark fruit lead the way, with chewy, dense berry flavors coming next. It's bolstered by warm, oaky hints that settle on mocha and spice, so it fits the familiar style of what is good Mendoza wine.",Red Blend
Argentina,"For several vintages running Broquel has nudged the border between very good and excellent, but as in years past the '06 is a touch tangy and racy, with black cherry, plum and berry flavors. It's bold, zippy and quite high-toned, but still it's very competent and held together.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tomero is a new line from the Carlos Pulenta group, and this one sings the tale of Salta with sincerity. You get telling acacia and lychee aromas, but none of the cheap perfume that can sometimes ruin the variety. The palate is lightly oily but linear, while the papaya, citrus and melon flavors just roll along.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Congratulations go to Schroeder for having the guts to blend Pinot Noir and Malbec, and to get a great wine out of it. The mix is pure Patagonia, and after some fiery, dark aromas the palate takes over with a mix of bright fruit and chocolate. Round, large and full to the last drop, this is well worth a go should you come across it. 1,000 cases made.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Cruz Alta is a new, higher-end label from Escorihuela, the long-time maker of value-priced Don Gascón. This is indeed a reserve-level wine (with 15% Cabernet and Syrah), and it's ripe, forward, powerful and mildly tannic. And there's lots of oak to offset the dark berry flavors. Finishes toasty and firm, with mocha.",Malbec
Argentina,"Robust, deep and candied on the nose, with rooty richness, medicinal notes and complexity. The palate is smooth, meaty, healthy and suave, with lush black fruit, prune and earthy flavors. Long, likable and showing a lot of depth and structure. Drink now through 2014.",Malbec
Argentina,"Full, dense and dark, with powerful berry aromas and hints of rubber and leather on the bouquet. The palate breathes complexity and style but also raw power, and the flavors of blackberry, fig paste and herbs are just lusty and rich enough to register as modern Mendoza. Classy and deep; best from 2011–2015. A Malbec-Cabernet-Petit Verdot blend.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Blackberry, ripe plum, mineral and coconut aromas blend well together, and the palate is warm, full-bodied and deep, with ripe berry, chocolate and warmth. Mocha, vanilla and coffee flavors all carry the toasty finish to a fine crescendo. Having not rated this wine before, we find this to be a fine debut. Drink now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"Brick in color and a bit Bordeaux-like in aromas, mouthfeel and flavors. Scents of dry herbs, tobacco and leafy red fruits are interesting and cool, while the palate mixes flavors of tobacco, dry fruit, brown sugar and herbs. Finishes with mild oak and coconut. Almost Rioja and/or Bordeaux in its overall presentation.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A deep, concentrated wine with a touch of raisin and latex on the nose. The palate is deep and pure, with cola, chocolate and pure berry flavors, and the finish has great persistence and warmth. Thick, ripe and balanced, with simple deliciousness and good texture. 750 cases made; drink now through 2012.",Malbec
Argentina,"Spice and clay notes grace this earthy Cabernet-led wine that sports black cherry, berry and earth notes. The palate is forward and grabby, with rubbery tannins to go with flavors of roasted berries, plum sauce, chocolate and savory spices. A no-hiccup Cabernet (with 12% Cab Franc) with just enough ruggedness to avoid being commonplace.",Cabernet Blend
Argentina,"Trapiche's Broquel is definitely one of Argentina's most consistent Bonardas. It opens with balsamic notes that accent chocolate and blackberry aromas, while the palate is sweet and steady as it delivers plum and ripe berry flavors. Good structure and feel, with just enough acidity to keep it in balance.",Bonarda
Argentina,"This is Torrontes in its pure, true form. Trapiche has captured the light, floral essence of the grape and wrapped it in an oily but smooth package that houses lovely green apple and papaya flavors. With structure, flavor and balance, this wine will go well with a wide range of summer foods.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Cavas Weinert is an old-school Mendoza winery and it holds its wines longer than most, which is why this 2002 is just now a new release. Thank Weinert for the bottle age and give this wine plenty of air. What you'll get is earth, leather, complexity, depth and ample berry fruit and chocolate. Decant for best results.",Malbec
Argentina,"Chakana makes some good wines, and the pack is led by this prestige-level blend of Cab Sauvignon, Malbec and Bonarda. It's plenty racy and forward, with plum and berry flavors that ring the bell. Toward the end some oak-based vanilla enters the game to applause. A yummy, well-made wine.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Despite tough vintage conditions, Bodega Septima got this blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Tannat right. The nose is dark, solid and full of attractive black fruit and coconut aromas. Lush and a mile deep on the palate, with sultry, smoky, dark flavors of blackberry, licorice and spice. A chewy, rich and balanced wine; drink now through 2014.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Bella Vista is the richest, most dense of A-F's three single-vineyard Malbecs. It opens with leather, smoke, blueberry and floral aromas. Next in line is a chewy, dark palate of wild berry and earthy fruit flavors. Clean on the finish with a bit less acidity than its brothers, Altamira and Mirador. Drink now through 2015.",Malbec
Argentina,"This blend from the Nicasia and Adrianna vineyards is the best Malbec on the market today. There's raisin, mineral, licorice, blackberry and more. The mouth is like a Mack truck on ice skates, meaning it's both huge and elegant. And the mile-long finish of coffee, mocha and molten black fruit is awesome. Drink now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"Features intoxicating pastry, blueberry, cola and coffee aromas in front of a minerally, terroir-packed palate of soft black fruit, chocolate, fine herbs and other character-aiding touches. The mouthfeel is fabulous and the finish of Swiss chocolate and integrated spice is as smooth as silk. Drink now through 2011.",Malbec
Argentina,"Catena's signature wine is Cabernet Sauvignon-based, and it's a purple haze of dense, exotic aromas that lean toward lavender, flower petals and black fruit. It's saturated and fruity to the point of no return, with impeccable structure and mouthfeel. An avalanche of flavor and style. Drink now through 2015.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"A complete Argentinean Merlot with aromas of light oak, fresh berries and spice that all come together in harmony. The palate is a little chewy and grabby, but it tastes and feels real and full, with good tannins. For a ripe wine it isn't conflicted, over the top or challenging. Drink now through 2009.",Merlot
Argentina,"Adrianna is a higher-elevation, higher-acid single-vineyard Malbec, and it's a component of the otherworldly Argentino blend. On its own, it's fresh, healthy and sturdy. The nose offers smoky, jerky, rubber and black-fruit aromas, which are backed by exotic herb, plum and boysenberry flavors. Firm, delicious and finely structured. Drink now through 2012.",Malbec
Argentina,"With its earthy fruit and wet clay aromas, this wine shows that Argentine Cabernet is capable of aging well. Across the palate you'll find ripe, vital tannins pushing cherry, raspberry and cassis flavors, with a touch of brown sugar on the finish. Imported by Vinecrest Co.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Oaky, creamy and a bit lactic on the nose, with an easy style to the palate and ripe, sweet flavors of blackberry and black cherry that are delicious but lack complexity. Finishes big, syrupy and sweet, with a spot of raisin. Really good for a blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Petit Verdot. Drink now through 2013.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Big, dark, sweet and jammy on the nose, with earthy, candied, sweet aromas of ripe blackberry and herbs. The palate delivers bouncy, showy acidity, while the flavors of black cherry, dark plum and chocolate are solid and rewarding. A little pruney on deeper inspection, with a leathery quality to the wine's depth. Drink now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"Consistently a very good Cabernet, with big, broad roasted aromas backing solid black fruit. The palate is rich, rugged and powerful, with mildly baked plum and blackberry flavors. Oak and vanilla show up on the finish, which is round and the slightest bit herbal. Drink now through 2012.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Warm dark fruit aromas of blueberry are accented by rubber and earth. The palate is deep and racy, with no dead weight and good flavors of berry, cassis, spice and chocolate. Bright in feel, focused and just oaky and dry enough to not be jammy and soft. 35,000 cases made.",Malbec
Argentina,"About five years into its existence and Colomé has found its groove in this excellent, luscious Malbec-Cabernet blend. The bouquet is exotic and savory, with classic dark-fruit aromas, spice, cocoa and more. Big on the palate, with cassis, wild berry and chocolate flavors, and the finish is big, ripe and sturdy. Good now through 2013.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Inky dark and an outstanding example of high-end Malbec. This is the finest Alta we've tried; it is ripe as can be but not raisiny. The palate is creamy and lush, but with good acidic balance. And the flavors of black fruits, chocolate and spice make it a league-leader. Drink now through 2012.",Malbec
Argentina,"The nose is dusty and inviting, with notes of spiced berries, molasses, sandalwood and artisan soap. Very saturated but well balanced, with a creamy, oily mouthfeel and sweet, generous flavors of plum, blackberry and chocolate. Mellow and delicious from start to finish, and a winner even at this high price.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Unus is 70% Malbec and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, but what you need to know is that it's 100% excellent. The nose features a rich blend of tobacco, baked plum and leather, while the palate is saturated, concentrated and tastes of cassis and blackberry. Clean, intense and complex",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Big and strong, with full but easy black-fruit aromas. Ripeness is where it should be, as cassis and berry flavors work the consistent palate before giving way to a medium-long finish. Along the way there are hints of herbs, coffee and cherry cough drop.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Ruca Malen's wines never taste manipulated or tweaked. This Malbec-Cabernet blend has a robust, meaty nose with licorice in the rear. The palate is balanced and tastes of fresh fruits and vanilla, and overall it's healthy, pure and uncomplicated. Value-hunting fans of Argentina should keep an eye on the Yauquén label.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Electric purple in color, with a concentrated, deep nose of mineral, black plum and toast. The palate is lush and giant, but balanced perfectly by natural acidity and fine tannins. Huge berry and plum flavors are dense, and vanilla, coffee and herb flavors grace the long finish. Drink from 2010 through 2016.",Malbec
Argentina,"Like its little brother Calvulcura, this wine is Cabernet Sauvignon mixed with Merlot. It's a big boy with stewed berries, prune and licorice on the bouquet. Below that heavy nose is a palate that's sweet and ripe, and arguably too much so. If chocolate, richness and heft are your thing, this is a winner; purists, however, may wish for more tannin, structure and nuance.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
Argentina,"Movie popcorn, baked fruits and plenty of toast and vanilla work the entry, while forward flavors of apple and pear are kicked up a notch by full acidity. And what that all means is that fruit pierces the fairly heavy oak on this wine, leaving you with a lot of the positives of New World Chardonnay. Nice in this price range.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Round, pretty and ripe; a dead knock-off for modern-style Rioja. There are sun-baked aromas but not the cooked type, with a palate that pushes dark berry flavors and chocolate. A rich, almost medicinal wine, the type that can often cost $50. And here it's $9. Weighs in at 14.6%, so it should have its fans.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"A blasting bouquet of oak and affiliated cinnamon and spice are wave one, while next up there's dark fruit and a wealth of vanilla. This is one saturated Malbec, with menthol and tannins in spades. Only medium follow-through on the finish tempers the final grade. Imported by Southern Wine Group.",Malbec
Argentina,"If you want ripe-fruit aromas and flavors along with spice, pepper and coffee accents, this well-oaked but reasonably restrained Malbec is your ticket. The flavors run closer to raspberry and strawberry than many big Malbecs, and the texture and balance are just right. This wine delivers the maximum given its price and pedigree.",Malbec
Argentina,"Wines like this have defined and propelled Malbec mania. It's ripe, bold and firm, with welcoming berry aromas and a powerful but healthy palate of ripped black cherry, berry and cola flavors. In the mix and on the finish you'll find coffee and mocha. Drink now and over the next two years.",Malbec
Argentina,"Very clean, smooth and inviting. Every piece is in place, and the wine flows from nose to palate to finish with ease and comfort. Flavors of black cherry, cassis and blackberry are creamy and deep, with a hint of vanilla sweetness and oak. Warm and chewy as well. Cabernet Sauvignon with 12% Cab Franc; drink now.",Cabernet Blend
Argentina,"Chunky, ripe and fruity, with bacon and roasted berry aromas. The palate has a good feel and tannins that melt away, while the flavors of black cherry and cassis lean toward medicinal but don't fully go there. Bold like Malbec should be, with hints of rubber and latex on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Another fine wine from this unheralded producer. Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot weave a nice picture based on sweet raisin, coconut and chocolate aromas. The palate is tannic but generous, with flavors of prune, blackberry, chocolate and tobacco. Chubby, rich and ripe, with intensity and darkness throughout.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Rubbery raspberry and cassis aromas give it a red fruited nose, while the palate is driving, fresh and full of raspberry, plum and sweet spice. More snappy, edgy and fresh than heavy and rich, with crispness and commendable balance.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tight and rubbery at first, but with time it settles to show jammy wild-berry aromas and density. The palate has bounce and life to spare, while the flavors are bright, fruity and full. A serious Malbec with a bit of hit and scratch to the finish. Drink now into 2012.",Malbec
Argentina,"Floral and fruity on the nose, with a strong bouquet of cassis, blackberry and ink. The palate has depth and power but also good feel, and the flavors of blackberry and dark plum are pure and accented by cocoa and cola. Toasty, dark and long on the finish.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Fruity and forward, but airing allows restraint and character to emerge. Still, this is a red-blooded red wine with racy fruit, plenty of freshening acids, pepper and bitter chocolate at the end. Best in late 2008 into 2009.",Malbec
Argentina,"Full, dark and minty, with aromatic notes of coconut and ink. One look, sniff and sip tells you this is a dark, ripe wine with extract. It's fairly lush but still tannic and balanced, with black coffee and other dark flavors on the somewhat narrow palate and finish. Imported by Excelsior Wine & Spirits.",Malbec
Argentina,"At 15% alcohol and with a nose full of prune, blazing oak and simmering blackberry jam, this is not for the weak. In fact, it may not be for the strong, because while we like the wine's sun-baked, ultraripe personality, we also acknowledge that it's teetering on the brink and probably won't age for very long.",Malbec
Argentina,"Finca Las Moras is getting fancy with this proprietary blend of Malbec and Bonarda, and with good results. The wine offers earthy, heavily wooded aromas in front of generous black cherry and chocolate flavors. It's a saturated, superripe wine that may miss a beat or two along the tour but has its positives.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Bold and packed to the gills with black fruit, well-applied oak and rubbery, fresh tannins. As Bonarda goes, this is a clear winner; it's blowsy and ribald on the nose, with tons of black fruit, coconut and mocha. The palate is firm but not overly hard, with fig, black plum and length to the finish. Drink now through 2012.",Bonarda
Argentina,"A bit rusty in color and mature, but that's what makes this wine different than most. It's earthy, a bit leathery and muddled, and slightly baked. But it's also subdued, mellow and sturdy, with lighter tannins and hints of herbs to go with finely roasted berry and tomato flavors. Integrated, long and spicy late. Drink now through 2012.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Sweet aromas of black raisin and licorice are a good indicator of what's to come. This is one thick, jammy, softer-bodied wine that's ready to drink now. Flavors of saturated blackberry, mocha and black pepper are attractive, and the finish ends with molasses sweetness and espresso bitterness.",Syrah
Argentina,"Nice black cherry, cassis and earthy rubber aromas form a familiar, friendly type of Malbec nose, while the palate is juicy and lifted by acidity. Flavors of blackberry and chocolate are solid and under control, and the finish is mildly peppered and consistent with what comes before it. Drink now through 2011.",Malbec
Argentina,"Clean, light, tropical aromas draw you in, and there's also some tangerine and melon on the nose. The palate is fresh and pure, with honeydew, kiwi and lychee flavors. There's no excess here, and thus the dry, melony finish is just right. A correct and appealing Torrontés.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Smoky and sultry smelling, with berry jam aromas and ample subtleties. The palate is tannic and lively, like a good, masculine youngster should be. And the flavors of raspberry and plum are vivid and smack hard against the inside of your cheeks. Could use a year, but it's drinkable now with steak.",Red Blend
Argentina,"An improvement over the dull, mulchy 2005; this wine is still a little earthy, heavy and gaseous out of the bottle but with airing it offers ripe strawberry and plum flavors with licorice and tree-bark accents. Solid, a bit tannic and slightly resiny from barrel aging; but it's also a legitimate Pinot Noir with some elevated qualities.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"The ultimate patio/terrace wine has been found, and it's Urban from O. Fournier. True as can be, with lychee, acacia and green melon aromas and flavors, this wine is plump but refreshing, with honest Cafayate character. Maybe the best under-$10 white wine being made in Argentina.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Bold blackberry and cola aromas work the nose on this bold, muscular Malbec-Syrah blend. But just when your expectations are at their highest, the palate doesn't quite meet expectations with its angular acidity and sharp-edged feel. The fruit is here, and with it the aromas and flavors. But moutfeel and balance are thin and piercing.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Aromas of baked plum, spice and bramble give it a sweet-savory opening. The palate is a touch scratchy but also endowed with tasty raspberry, plum and spice flavors. All totaled it's slightly heavy and probing, yet the burnt caramel, chocolate and dark fruit on the finish seem right for the wine.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"The bringing together of Malbec and Tempranillo works like a charm here. There's a touch of complexity to the fruit-forward nose, and better depth than what most under-$10 red varietals offer. Look for sweet, smooth raspberry and plum flavors with a tasty, balanced finish.",Malbec-Tempranillo
Argentina,"By far the best wine in the El Fogón lineup is this Torrontes. The nose is clean and harmonious, with light flower blossom scents. A citrusy mix blends with both apple and pear fruit on the palate, and the finish is clean, if a bit sweet (residual sugar?). Drink as soon as possible.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Smooth and consistent Malbec from Cafayate is what Michel Torino is all about. Don David is a higher-aiming effort, and while it shows a touch of northern Argentina's herbal, sun-affected characteristics, it's also a well-balanced, formulaic Malbec that hits all the markers: good color, nice body, friendly tannins and plenty of oak.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pronounced oak is the opening blast, and amid the shy red berry and tomato leaf aromas there are hints of leather, mint and coconut. All these scents indicate that heavy wood was thrown at the wine, so while the power and goals of the wine are admirable, it's weighed down presently by a touch too much resin. Maybe that'll drift with time but that's not for sure.",Malbec
Argentina,"A good finisher, with early minty, resiny aromas giving way to broader, more typical ripe aromas and flavors. The mouthfeel is lively courtesy of vivid core acidity, while the berry and cherry flavors come across ripe and grabby. The more air you give it the better it'll perform. Imported by Slocum & Sons.",Malbec
Argentina,"Open and rewarding, with strawberry and raspberry aromas followed by ripe, clean cherry and raspberry flavors. Don't expect a ton of depth or richness, but do expect a food-friendly wine that's convincing and well made.",Merlot
Argentina,"Soft, easy and totally ripe, this easygoing blend of Cabernet and Merlot should win over most consumers because it's a friendly sort that's endowed with cola, plum and abundant richness. Opponents may find it soft and mealy, but no matter where you stand it should be drunk as soon as possible. Imported by SWG Imports.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
Argentina,"Here and there you'll find a very well-made Argentine Viognier because the country's warmth and the grape can go together. A case in point is this plump, lush specimen that sports developed lemon and orange flavors and a long, acid-propelled finish.",Viognier
Argentina,"Concha Y Toro's Argentine property seems to be getting it right with Malbec. This affordable number is dark and dense, with plum and prune on the nose and concentrated berry flavors on the palate. For a meaty, structured, fully oaked Malbec, Trivento is the call. Imported by Excelsior Wine & Spirits.",Malbec
Argentina,"If you'd like a little character, bramble and spice to your Cab, then this is where you should go. Yes, it starts out with leather, pickle barrel and a lot of bramble bush, but every time you go back to it there's more fruit, polish, complexity and style. It's interesting, ripe and a step up from your basic street-level Cabernet.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Here's a Bordeaux-style blend to snap up if you're lucky enough to find it. It's a definite re-issue in that it was first released at $25 in 2006 but was put back on the market last year at $15. And what a bargain it is: Earth, tar and tobacco vie with dried cherry and raspberry on the nose and palate; the finish is long, elegant and dry. A mature, classy wine to drink now.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Plenty of mocha and vanilla combined with racy berry aromas give this an ice cream sundae-type of bouquet. The palate is healthy and snappy, with lively acidity pushing black cherry and meaty plum flavors. Whole and toasty on the finish, with touches of excellence throughout. Impressive for a first effort, with room to improve. Drink now through 2012.",Malbec
Argentina,"Almost everything about this wine is right on the money, from bouquet and flavors to feel and price. The nose is sweet and floral, with deep, alluring berry aromas. The palate offers a fine texture, with pure, layered blackberry, cola and spice flavors. Satisfying on the finish and complete.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dense and warm, with an aroma package of raisin and roasted black fruits. The wine smacks your cheeks with ripe tannins and full fruit, and the flavors of roasted berries carry some bitterness on the back end. Chewy, rich and good, with an elevated character.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A pure, sweet, easygoing, full-bodied red wine with tons of boysenberry, currant and chocolaty aromas and flavors. Dark and saturated in the mouth, with a bouncy palate, youthful but tolerable tannins, and a fudge-infused finish. Shines a positive light on varietal Bonarda.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Bright fruit, mildly creamy, with good zest and acidity. Shows a sweet, savory center with hints of brown sugar and spice sitting along the edges. Easy tannins make it a friendly style; good for near-term drinking. No cellaring necessary.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Hard black fruit and notes of tire rubber and tar indicate that this is a dark, masculine wine. And while it does offer power, it's actually quite racy and balanced in the mouth. Flavorwise, expect black raspberry and some bitter cocoa. Overall, there's nothing unripe about it.",Malbec
Argentina,"Interesting Argentine Cabernet, with rooty, baked aromas that settle in and impress if given time. The palate is balanced by subtle red-fruit and earthy flavors, while the feel is stocky and grabby courtesy of strong tannins. A good wine with a lot of positives.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"After you chop your way through the black forest of char, roasted berry and coffee aromas, you'll encounter a pretty large mass of flavors that include blackberry, cola, root beer and cinnamon. It's a fairly packed and saturated wine at 14.9%, and the finish of mocha and chocolate accentuates the wine's oak elevage. Best for those who like ripeness and size. The blend is 60% Merlot and 40% Cab Sauvignon.",Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Full, serious and ripe, with leather, animal and an underside of savory oak and bacon. Typical of the house style, the wine is lush and jammy, with syrupy black-fruit flavors setting up a composed, rich finish. Best for fans of hefty, New World reds.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark and heavily oaked on first blush, but give it time to unwind or let it sit in the bottle for a year or two and this will satisfy any Malbec lover. Early on, it's dense and full of shoe polish, mint and coconut; later it spreads out to show sweet dark-berry flavors and finally a rich, almost sticky finish of woodspice, brown sugar and lushness.",Malbec
Argentina,"A wonderful wine from the Uco Valley of Mendoza that opens with fine fruit, richness and molten earth. The palate is big as they come but not hard and out of whack, and the flavors are an amalgam of rich black plum, berry fruit, fig paste and chocolate. Smoky and sultry on the back end, with mocha and coffee for finishing notes. Drink now through 2014.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Smoky and deep, with hickory and concentrated black fruit on the nose. The palate packs punch, and the flavors of blackberry, black cherry and chocolate are friendly, meaty and dark. Fairly tannic and big for a Mendoza Syrah. Not complex but seriously dark and full.",Syrah
Argentina,"Much better and way more complex than your average Torrontés. The bouquet is flower power, lychee and tangerine, and overall this is an exotic, driving wine like no other from Argentina. Expect roundness and similarities to Viognier; it's amplified and impressive.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Immediately this one shines. The nose offers deep bacon, crusty mineral and hefty, perfectly ripe dark-fruit aromas. Balance is key to the wine's success, with beefy, sweet flavors of black plum offset by some fire and proper acidity. Peppery on the finish, with an overall warm, ripe, toasty personality. Ready to drink now.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Nice berry aromas feature a smidgen of spice and herbs, while the palate has forward acidity that props up lively berry flavors. Expect no frills and this big-format Merlot will satisfy. It's ripe and sweet, and overall it's done right.",Merlot
Argentina,"For two years running this Torrontes is White Pearl's most praiseworthy wine. It is true and tasty, with flowery aromas leading to flavors of lychee, papaya, melon and grass. Decent body and length give it credibility as a 1.5L Best Buy.",Torrontés
Argentina,"A touch of mineral and charcoal-based darkness interacts with black currant and berry aromas, while the palate is rich, smoky and dark, with huge berry flavors touched up by cracked black pepper, chocolate and burnt toast. Solid as a rock and covers all the bases of a good Bordeaux-style blend. Drink from 2010 through 2013.",Red Blend
Argentina,"From longtime Catena winemakers Mariano de Paola and Pepe Galante, this is a deep, black-fruited Malbec with a cushioned bouquet, violet notes and delightful blackberry character. The palate is deep, juicy, healthy and balanced, and the finish is smooth and offers a whiff of coconut. Solid, serious and good now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"Outstanding red wine for the price. Henry is a blend of Malbec, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, and it's clean, generous, lush, complex and highly satisfying for $20. The nose is clean and deep, while the pure palate features cola, blackberry, cassis and toast. Modern in style but not overdone. Drink now through 2012.",Red Blend
Argentina,"As always, Noemía is proof that excellent Malbec can come from Patagonia. Big, bold and smoky on the nose, with blackberry and bacon. The palate is broad and bulky but balanced, while flavors of smoked meats, black fruits, licorice and especially clove stand out. Dark with a persistent clove note on the finish. Best now through 2012.",Malbec
Argentina,"Noemía's signature Malbec, now in its third vintage, is one of the country's best. It starts out herbal and smoky, with a lot of dark French oak. The mouth is powerful and pure, with at least three layers of complex flavors and textures. The fruit is both subtle and loud. Simply an excellent wine of world-class character. Best in 2008–09.",Malbec
Argentina,"Not a hair is out of place on this pure and potent Malbec. The bouquet is crusty and rich, with berry and bitter chocolate aromas. The palate is chock-full of mulberry, black cherry, nutmeg and cocoa powder; the finish is smooth and rewarding. Good through 2008.",Malbec
Argentina,"Touches of tree bark, nutmeg and aged cheese give the nose diversity compared to the standard blackberry and vanilla, and in the mouth the wine is full of cola, root beer and other savory flavors in addition to berry fruit. It's a bit grabby and tannic, but overall it is quite good.",Malbec
Argentina,"A good effort by Cavas Weinert. The wine is starting to mature, and along the road you get ripe berry aromas that broaden and improve with time. The plum, blackberry and red apple flavors are right, as is the tannin-to-acid balance. The only complaint is a mild chemical-paint thinner note at the base of the bouquet.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sweet plum, raisin and chocolate work the welcoming nose, and on the palate the wine is generous but easy to understand; the flavors are flush and ripe but none too complicated. Simply stated, this wine is healthy and well made.",Malbec
Argentina,"The opening of floral and plum aromas is nice, and that's followed by some earth and heft. The palate is fleshy and tannic, with deep raspberry and plum flavors. The depth on this wine is pretty good, yet it finishes sort of short.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Woody and smelling of sawdust early, this four-grape blend eases toward roasted berry, cassis, herbal plum and molten chocolate. It's massive and structured, with a big-boned skeleton and heat on the leathery, roasted finish due to 15.5% alcohol. Big, fiery, saucy and lusty, but short on refinement and elegance.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Round, dense and correct on the nose, with heft and dark fruit aromas. The palate is tight, pure and just the right size, with blackberry, boysenberry and a bit of vanilla and caramel in the background. Smooth on the tail end, with sweet coconut and mocha notes. Friendly and well done for the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"A rich and creamy sort of Malbec that pours on the weight, extract and oaky, coconutty character. The palate is syrupy, with huge flavors of roasted berry, molasses and sweet spices. Arguably on the baked and heavy side, but definitely a rich, huge wine with just enough core acidity to keep it balanced.",Malbec
Argentina,"Clos de los Siete, the amalgmated product of Michel Rolland's Uco Valley wine commune, is rich, round and ripe, with deep aromas and trimmings like polished oak and minerality. The wine is proper, medium to full in size, and full of blackberry, plum and cocoa. No hiccups, pure fruit and complexity make this stellar for the price.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Basso's premium blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah and Merlot is an example of good fruit meeting good winemaking. With leather and brick dust accenting black-fruit aromas, the bouquet is positive. And the flavors of plum, blackberry, soy sauce and cola are very nice. A breakout wine for this winery.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Intense, saturated and well balanced, with touches of motor oil, earth and herbs on the nose. The palate is flush and mouthfilling, with proper tannic bite, fine acidity and stylish flavors of blackberry and raspberry.",Malbec
Argentina,"One of the best $15 red blends being made today. Carrascal gives us 45% Malbec, 35% Merlot and 20% Cabernet in rock-solid form. The nose has toast, mineral, balsam wood and good berry fruit, and the palate provides the troika of cherry, raspberry and plum with no interference or oaky gimmicks. Pleasant, warm and long on the finish.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Floral fruit aromas are neither heavy nor concentrated, but they are a touch medicinal and chocolaty. Flavors of clove, cherry, plum and oak are racy, while the finish is a bit resiny and weighted down by vanilla. Good wine for the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"A major-league oakster, with oily popcorn and baked apple aromas. The oak and vanilla are lead players on the palate as well, but along the way there's balancing acidity, length and good flavors of spiced apple, lemon curd and cinnamon. Woody and plump on the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Woodsy spice, clove and chocolate announce the oak that is the lead factor throughout the wine. The nose is creamy and resiny green, with vanilla yogurt, plum and berry flavors coming next. Solid in terms of acidity and feel, but a little bit lactic due to the wood treatment.",Malbec
Argentina,"Toast and char sit atop the bouquet like a heavy king on his throne, but there's nothing fake or weak about it. The color is dark and the palate is round; flavors of black plum, figs and black olives convey a meaty, true personality amid all the char, chocolate and vanilla. A good wine in the massive category that is value-priced Merlot.",Merlot
Argentina,"Every llama has its day, and for Funky Llama this is one to take to the bank. The olive, leather and dry oaky aromas set the stage for solid cassis, raspberry and herb flavors. The body, feel and finish seem right, so for the money it's a blue chip special.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This is Bousquet's better 2006 Malbec because it doesn't have the heavy-handed oak of the Reserva. Here you get a ton of ripe, clean fruit with secondary leather and earth aromas. The palate is lively as it hits with firm blackberry and plum flavors. Not complex but good in its simplicity. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Malbec
Argentina,"Like a good Bonarda should be, this is sweet, lush, dense and jammy on the nose. The palate brings big tannins and a slight rubbery mouthfeel, but the flavors of black cherry and wild berry are big, tasty and untamed. Full of power; needs airing upon opening but aging isn't necessary. Includes 20% Malbec and 10% Cab Franc.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Dark as night, with shoe polish, coconut and powerful black-fruit aromas. This is jammy, dense, soft and not for aging, but it does deliver a truck load of toasted coffee, blackberry, molasses and crisped brown sugar. Supersweet, rich and made to drink now.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Broad and bullish is this blend of Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon. The nose is rich and granular, with hints of plum, raisin and iodine. It airs out nicely, exposing boysenberry and cassis flavors. And it finishes rock solid, with depth. It's all here; excellent wine from a mediocre vintage.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Heavily toasted and loaded with black cherry and blackberry aromas, this blend of Cabernet, Malbec and Petit Verdot pushes cola, chewy plum and black-fruit flavors. The back end is all about coffee, mocha and bitter chocolate, and as a whole this wine shows Argentina in a fine light. As for the winery, Chakana almost always gets it right.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A year or two ago when Paul Hobbs began consulting for Toso things changed for the better. This is the rare Best Buy that can swim with the big fish and give them a run for the money. Pop the cork and enjoy lusty dark aromas of Turkish tobacco and berry compote. In the mouth, there's a riot of fruit flavors to ponder followed by a smooth, lusty finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sweet blackberry and black cherry aromas are accented by mint leaf and woodspice, while the palate is slightly more narrow and snappy than you might expect, with cherry, raspberry and cough drop flavors. A little high in acidity and snap, with medicinal cherry on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Aromas of violets, blackberry and black currant jam are solid, while the palate shows sharper acidity than most Bonardas, and thus a juicy sensation along with flavors of snappy black cherry and boysenberry. Fresh and forward, with a lot of fruit and potency.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Apricot and oak aromas make for a smoky, slightly heavy bouquet. The wine keeps that weightiness as it passes from nectarine to citrus to tropical fruits. Long on the finish, with integrity. But it's also a bit citric in the center. “Pulpy” is another descriptor.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"This is a blend of Cab Sauvignon, Malbec and Merlot that's agile, fresh and offers good mouthfeel. The nose deals crushed brick, leather, spice and light red fruit, while the flavors run toward red cherry and red currants. Uncomplicated; drink now. Imported by Quintessential Wines, LLC.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A full and pulsing wine, with leather and other animal notes to make things more interesting. The mouth is like a black-fruit explosion: muscular berry and tannins fly all over the place, ending in a lively, almost fiery finish. A bit grabby and overexcited, but good with grilled meats.",Malbec
Argentina,"From San Rafael in southern Mendoza, this Cab Sauvignon picks up a little more steam and complexity every time you go back to it. The nose is your basic cassis and raspberry, while the medium-weight palate features ripe fruit finishing in a sweet cascade of milk chocolate and burnt brown sugar. Satisfying, especially if you like a hint of sweetness to your Cab.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Jammy red-fruit aromas mixed with buttery oak make for a simple, sappy nose. There's more butter on the palate in addition to solid blackberry flavors. It finishes round but short, with yet another wave of barrel. A very good wine but not one that wows.",Malbec
Argentina,"A lovely, crisp-styled Malbec (with 10% Merlot) that does the Río Negro region of Patagonia proud. A Lisa is in its inaugural vintage, and the wine boasts toast, mineral and black fruit both on the nose and in the mouth. Not exactly streamlined but tighter than most Malbecs. Drink now into 2008.",Malbec
Argentina,"After a rubbery opening, this blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Bonarda picks up steam and freshens up significantly. Aromas of sly dried berry take over, leading to a full, flush palate of plum, raspberry and raisin. Comes around the more time you spend with it.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Very nice Malbec for the money. The bouquet is floral and bright, with a hint of dry oak and mocha. The feel is full and well balanced, while the palate has a bright and lively personality with cherry, raspberry, chocolate and spice flavors. Smooth, tastes good and offers plenty of value.",Malbec
Argentina,"A dark and toasty specimen with a deep-purple tint and aromas of oak, butter and powerful blackberry fruit. The palate is textured and rich, with thick, smoky flavors of black fruits and peppery spice. Pours on the oak but in an integrated way; very good for varietal Cab from 2008.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dark, sweet and rooty on the nose, with a warm, soft outlook. The palate is bold and thorough, with ripe berry, plum and chocolate flavors. Per usual, Punto Final is ripe, sweet and big, with a peppery finish and toasty, jammy warmth.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lively but also narrow on the nose. The feel is very fresh and juicy due to firm, bracing acidity that gives a tangy, lemony character to the wine's dark-fruit core. Snappy, linear and crisp for a wine of magnitude and extraction. Some might say it's sheering and acidic; others might call it ageworthy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark and raisiny, and pushing the ripeness meter to the max. This is a dense, sweet, semihot wine with raisin, stewed berry and jammy black cherry flavors. It's big and broad, more simple than complex, with a raisiny DNA and a boatload of sweetness. Personally, I prefer Cassone's less expensive, more balanced reserva to this wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Amancaya, a blend of Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon, never fails to impress. This wine is rich and controlled but also alert and upright. It is juicy and succulent, with ripe blackberry and cassis at its base. Finishes tight and long, and sports a fine structure throughout.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Big, meaty and dense, with dampness, earth and size. This is your typical deep and chewy wine, but the structure and core qualities are just above average. Flavors of black cherry, plum and brown sugar are good, while the finish shows a creamy vanilla flavor and cola. Good but not great for the price.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"NQN's Picada 15 line is a consistent source for good value among red wines. This four-grape blend (led by Cabernet Sauvignon) has a slight aroma of burnt leaves and tire rubber, but it settles with air into a good whole. Flavors of sweet berry fruits have an herbal edge, while the mouthfeel and finish are creamy, rich and smooth. Nice wine for the price.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Saturated in color almost to the point of opaque. The nose is brash, with rubbery berry, chocolate and sandalwood aromas. Intense but not overpowering, with flavors of sweet black plum, berry and black currant. Spry and lively throughout, with licorice and bitter chocolate on the finish.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Blueberry with snap is the way to describe the bouquet on this fresh and spunky young Malbec. The flavors are sweet and intense, just like grapes off the vine. It doesn't offer much complexity but at the same time it doesn't taste confected or flawed in any way.",Malbec
Argentina,"Red berry fruit with touches of vanilla and spice give this bargain-priced Pinot a candied but inviting set of aromas. The palate runs on fresh fruit, and overall it's all about clean, forward juicy flavors and very little extra. A nice aperitif Pinot Noir.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"The wine is called 40 Barrels and every bit of those barrels is crawling on this Malbec-Cab blend. For starters, it smells more like hickory than fruit. Soon blackberry and prune aromas and flavors get into the game, but even then the back palate and finish are resiny. Some citric acidity in the center keeps it keen but raises questions about balance.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Slightly tart and like rhubarb at first, but if given some time this blend of Malbec, Merlot and Cabernet sweetens and becomes more friendly. Flavors of black cherry are bright, while the finish shows oaky vanilla, mocha and espresso notes.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Solid, condensed and smooth on the nose, with aromas of mocha and bold berry fruit. The palate is racy and deep, with lively blackberry and cassis flavors. Made from a mix of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this is long, big and attractive, and the structure is just right. Drink over the next four years.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Achaval's Uco Valley single-vineyard Malbec is strapping and minerally, with exotic black-fruit aromas darkened up by road tar but lightened by violets. It's focused and bright, with juicy cherry and black-plum flavors. Pure and direct, with a long finish. Drink now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark fruit and plenty of oak on the nose, with a creamy vanilla-based palate that's sporting plenty of new wood to match the bouquet. The barrel is front and center here, but there's also solid Cab texture and power. Imported by Excelsior Wine & Spirits.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Smoke, rubber and a touch of herbs and leaves make this more traditional in style, meaning it offers Old World Bordeaux notes of earth, mineral and subdued fruit as opposed to ripe, jammy berry notes. It's not a big, aggressive wine but it does have tannic strength and intensity. Malbec, Merlot and Cab Sauvignon make up the blend.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"In a shrinking domain (wines for under $10), this junior-league Malbec shows sweet, jammy aromas and legitimate berry flavors. And that alone puts it ahead of the game. The palate is basically a mish-mash of berry flavors and raw tannins, but with food, preferably hamburgers or ribs, it will do the trick.",Malbec
Argentina,"A rambunctious young buck of a wine, with untamed aromas and plenty of aggressiveness from front to back. It clamps with firm tannins while delivering dark plum and other black-fruit flavors. Gets better with airing and may improve in the bottle. Now, it needs food to tame the beast.",Malbec
Argentina,"Familia Schroeder is making good, restrained wines in Neuquén. This Merlot won't rock your world but it will deliver firm, fresh raspberry flavors, food-friendly acidity and solid tannins. And it's even got some chewy sweetness.",Merlot
Argentina,"A tale of two wines. The early impression is that of a foxy, incomplete, sweaty wine with gaps in the fabric. But once it gets air, things turn around for the better. Ultimately it proves itself as a serious Malbec with a broad texture and jammy, sweet berry fruit. But it starts out so scattered and funky that it remains compromised.",Malbec
Argentina,"Earthy and rugged at first, then it smoothes out to show cola and lush berry aromas. Plump and round in the mouth, with jammy blackberry core flavors, a hint of herbs and spice, and then a chewy, sticky, generous finish. Very nice Malbec with a cool identity.",Malbec
Argentina,"Extremely ripe and concentrated but arguably a bit too massive for its own good. That said, we love the wine's tobacco, cassis and inky qualities, but worry a little about the lemony oak character and overall potency. Deep as midnight in terms of flavors, with black fruits galore setting up a richly packed, ultraripe finish. New World to the max but very tasty and rich.",Syrah
Argentina,"Septima is owned by Codorníu of Spain, and it hit the market solidly in 2002, disappeared for a couple of years, and now is back with a great Best Buy. The 2006 Malbec is a rock star wine in sheep's clothing. Shows size and power along with pure fruit, texture and balance. Lush and fruity until the end.",Malbec
Argentina,"All sorts of smoky berry, cola and controlled toast aromas get this wine going in the right direction. It tastes very good, with pure, less than bashful plum and cola flavors leading straight to a fruity, lasting finish. This may not have much sauvage, old world Syrah character; but for Argentina it's made right and registers from head to toe.",Syrah
Argentina,"A five-grape mash-up with savory aromas of roasted oak, smoke, bacon and clove aromas. Despite slightly crisp acidity, the wine is lusty and giving, with juicy cherry, cassis and other bright-flavored fruit. Good length and some chocolate on the finish send it away in fine form. 550 cases made.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Deep purple in color and fierce on the nose; there's no shortage of piercing French oak aromas to send this one on its way. But once it settles, the oak supports classy blackberry, boysenberry and peppery flavors along with a structured, dense mouthfeel.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is a lively, slightly jagged wine with full ripeness and lots of berry, spice and zip. The palate hits hard with cherry, raspberry and pepper flavors, and there's a bit of rasp and burn to the finish. Should get a little softer with more bottle age.",Merlot-Malbec
Argentina,"Warm and earthy, with a touch of sulfur that subsides with air. The palate is juicy but also sort of rich, and the flavors of mixed red fruits feature a couple of layers of potency that are followed by a compact, medium-length finish.",Malbec-Merlot
Argentina,"Floral and citric, with clean, juicy aromas that conjure memories of orange blossoms and fresh lime. The palate is light and mildly citric, with melon and papaya flavors bringing a tropical edge. Ready to drink now.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Starts with a nice mix of peppery, live-fruit aromatics along with earth. Has good weight and balance, while the flavors of plum, raspberry and black cherry are mellow and touched up by hints of spice, vanilla and herbs. Shows good character and composition.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Earthy and tight on the nose, with notes of wintergreen and fresh herbs. The palate is lean and drawing, while the flavors revolve around sweet berry fruit, earth and oak. Dry, peppery and a little bitter on the finish, but spicy and real. Nice and varietally correct for Argentinean Pinot.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Dark berry and meaty fruit on the nose, with plum and blackberry aromas. The palate is zestier, with bright acidity tempering any weight. The finish is solid, with nothing off or outlandish to consider. A good, solid, concentrated Syrah without a whole lot of varietal character.",Syrah
Argentina,"More baked, muddled and heavy than Alicia's Paso de Piedra bottling, with roasted plum/berry flavors and a heavy, forceful palate that carries some burn, heat and rubber. Big and bullish, like a proverbial toro in a china shop. A lot of oak, too.",Malbec
Argentina,"Waxy, round aromas are soft and properly indicate that this wine is already turning south. The palate lacks that certain Sauvignon Blanc edge but it does offer true flavors of melon, mango and orange. Full but fleshy.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Soft, ripe and chocolaty, with a raisiny quality on the bouquet. There's fading black plum and wild berry flavors; the mouthfeel is big but short on structure. Finishes with medium length and mild bitterness.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Earthy, spicy aromas soon give way to bramble, while the palate gives reasonably sweet but slightly tangy raspberry flavors. Some herbal leafiness enters on the finish, but not in an overbearing way. Good in a modest, basic way.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dense, rich and encouraging on the nose, with full blackberry flavors and a flush mouthfeel. For Argentine Cab this gets it right much more than wrong. The flavors are fairly well developed and the finish has length.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Not a bad steak or burger wine given that it offers some kicking acidity to go with sassy cherry and oak-based flavors. This is more of a forward, racy Cabernet. It doesn't lay heavily on the palate; in fact, it's a touch jumpy and staunch despite its oak cask moniker.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Having always liked this wine, which is 86% Cab and the rest Malbec and Merlot, the 2002 seems a touch bland and underwhelming. The color is dense and the nose muscular and herbal, but it peters out quickly and shows no signs that it will get better with age. Imported by Quintessential Wines, LLC.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A little loose on the bouquet, with a whiff of sulfur and leather to go with wild berry aromas. In the mouth, it's got an Old World coarseness that turns the flavor profile to pepper and espresso. At 60% Cabernet and 40% Malbec, it's worth the price.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"Leather, dark fruit and citrus peel make for a good nose, while the palate is meaty and a bit heavy as it pours on those classic dark-fruit flavors that Malbec is known for. Best to get at this one now because neither the palate nor the finish shows much acidity. A touch hollow.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big and jammy, and all in all it's a solid, good Malbec. Aromas of tar and prune give way to plum and blackberry flavors. On the finish, it's a touch salty and drying, but with food it will be smoother. Good for the money, although limited in depth and complexity.",Malbec
Argentina,"Solid, ripe and smooth on the nose, then red cherry and raspberry come forward on the zesty, tangy palate. The finish is long and healthy, but a bit monotone in its delivery. Freshness and pop are not lacking in this young Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Finding affordable but good Cab is not an easy chore, so let this solid, smoky wine fit that bill. The nose is like a cowboy campfire, complete with hickory, leather and cured meat. The palate is full-force and tannic, with plum and berry fruit. It may be slightly cooked and not for the long haul; so drink now.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Clove and other challenging aromas greet you, and never does this blend of Malbec, Cabernet, Bonarda and Merlot get it fully together. The palate seems a little reduced and short on feel, and while it widens and softens on the finish, the ride to get there is bumpy. Expect better in 2005.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Big and burly, with a semi- syrupy nose that brings berry jam, molasses, shoe polish and crusty, baked berry aromas. But don't dismiss this Cab as overripe and over the top; it is complete and balanced, with good acidity pushing black fruit, chocolate, clove and herb flavors to their maximum expression. And it dials it in on the finish, where cola and coffee notes are just right. Drink now through 2010.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Ripe to the tipping point of being a little bit baked, but the nose of spice and mint mixed with violet, black cherry and plum is attractive. The palate on this blend is concentrated but well balanced, and the jammy flavors of plum and berry are not too heavy.",Red Blend
Argentina,"An elevated, classy wine with earth, tobacco, leather and currant aromas. It's a little saucy and saturated, but with air it unveils layering and flavors of coconut (oak-based), leather, cassis and plum. Rich on the finish, with chocolate and rubber notes. Drink now or hold through 2011.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Huge and extracted, with an opaque purple color and a massive, aggressive nose that hints at stewed fruit, sweaty leather, blackberry compote and shoe polish. Forget elegance and go straight for this wine's unbridled size and density. If that sounds unappealing, pass it by.",Syrah
Argentina,"Buttercup and lemon aromas may not be overpowering but they are true to the variety. The flavors of melon and preserved tropical fruits work on the wine's fuller-bodied, almost creamy frame. Finishes warm but peachy, with an oily texture. Drink right away.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Gets going with a lot of barrel and leather, but maybe not as much fruit as one might hope for. Makes its point with a round, creamy mouthfeel that supports jammy plum and blackberry flavors. A very good Malbec that will be better once the vines age.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big and bulky, with a mixed bag of aromas that includes field scents, rubber and baked fruit. The palate deals berry and plum flavors, while the finish tilts toward heavy and medicinal. Seems like this one got a bit overripe and sticky. The 2003 was better.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Nice on the nose. The palate is steady but on the leaner side, with prickly tannins joining berry fruit, chocolate and toast. A tighter, Patagonian style of Malbec, meaning it's firm as opposed to lush.",Malbec
Argentina,"For an everyday red that won't wreck the wallet, this juicy, fresh Malbec qualifies. It offers sweet aromas of plum and berry, and the palate follows suit with blueberry and blackberry. The depth and complexity are limited but the fundamentals and enjoyment factor are measurable.",Malbec
Argentina,"A little choppy and tannic, with thin red-fruit aromas. The palate is of medium depth, with a bit of tannin-driven rawness to make things a little harder than ideal. Otherwise it's steady and warming.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Mint and rubber band scents open the bouquet, and then black fruit and marmalade aromas take over. This Bonarda is riper, softer and more cuddly than most, with ultraripe black-fruit flavors and soft tannins that make it borderline sappy. Plump, easygoing and loaded with fruit. Drink now to get the soft, giving side of this grape.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Sweet blackberry fruit and minerally darkness give this Malbec a smooth, inviting bouquet. And in the mouth, it's just as nice: light butter, juicy raspberry and plum flavors, and then dark spice on the finish. Among the best values in Argentina.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pungent with true Sauvignon character. Tangerine, green fruits and grapefruit share the flavor profile, and the finish is mild but clean. Zesty, straightforward and tasty if served chilled.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Probably the best wine we've tasted from Santos Beck. This has a jammy, meaty nose accented by hard spices, while the palate is creamy and a touch brambly. Coffee, pepper and tannins work the finish. Drink now.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A standard wine with ample berry and plum aromas supported by blackberry, plum and chocolate flavor. It's simple but smooth, with generic berry flavors, decent mouthfeel and length. Expect only the basics and it'll rank as good everyday wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Inky black in color, with a pretty nose defined by toast, minerality, stout plum and berry fruit. Round and vigorous in the mouth, with vibrant dark-berry flavors. A muscled-up wine from Salta with just enough finesse to balance everything out. Ready to drink.",Malbec
Argentina,"Quite tropical on the nose, with aromas of pineapple and passion fruit. The palate is a soft, honeyed bowl of kiwi, melon, cucumber and white pepper, while the finish is dry and gets more hollow as the wine warms up. Not a classic Sauvignon, but it has its virtues.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Stick with Sur's basic 2005 Malbec because it's fresher and cleaner than this raisiny, tannic brooder that tastes a little too much of stewy fruit and liqueur.",Malbec
Argentina,"California winemaker Patrick Campbell makes this perfumed, unusual Chardonnay, which is challenged but ultimately proves its worth. While it's nothing like Burgundy or other varietally correct Chards, it does show sweet melon, mango and other candied flavors. More for those wanting a simple, sweeter style.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"This Patagonian Malbec requires patience and forgiveness. The nose is milky and green at first, but airing paroles riper, redder aromas and flavors. Ultimately there's decent berry character and plumpness but not a lot of follow through or finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cabernet may always struggle to achieve ripeness in Patagonia, but Schroeder is getting pretty decent plum and blackberry character out of this wine. The mouthfeel, however, runs kind of hard and sheer. May get better in future vintages.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Plenty of patience is required with this wine, because at first it's rough and stewy, with herb and tomato aromas. Airing reveals a blackberry core and tannin-infused oak notes, while the finish features mostly char and vanilla. Has its merits but also some weaknesses.",Merlot
Argentina,"A little buttery and wayward, but not without its good points, which include ripe apple, melon, citrus and papaya flavors. The body is fairly hefty and the finish carries heat, but overall offers decent fruit-salad flavors and pretty good balance.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Aromas of lychee fruit, pineapple, nectarine and baby powder are fairly typical and welcoming. The palate offers bright but somewhat nondescript flavors that ultimately tilt toward melon. The finish hangs in there, showing moderate grace and length. All in all this is decent Torrontes from La Rioja, a province to the north of Mendoza.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Opens with brambly, leathery aromas; later shows some true Tempranillo character, namely body, tannin and dark-fruit flavors. This is not flawed, but it is rather oaky and demanding.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"A power-packed blend of 60% Cabernet and 40% Merlot that offers mossy aromas, earth and lush black fruit scents. The palate is lively yet balanced, with saturated wild berry, toast, anise and pepper flavors. Dark, toasted and showing licorice on the finish. A little hot and aggressive, so drink in late 2010 through 2012.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Lively black cherry and plum aromas indicate that this slightly older wine is still vibrant and healthy. The palate is solid, tannic and medium in weight, with sweet but balanced dark-fruit flavors. This is a tasty, well-made, familiar style of Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Saturated Malbec, with an opaque color and dense, sweet aromas that are slightly floral and pastry-like. Big and rich in the mouth, with bold cassis, blackberry and plum flavors floating on a soft, almost jammy structure. Finishes full and oily in texture. Rich and ready to drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"Light berry aromas and a hint of spice open up this generic but solidly made Malbec-Merlot blend. Strawberry and raspberry are the lead flavors, with pepper on the finish. Not very evolved or complex, but good enough.",Malbec-Merlot
Argentina,"Purple, smoky and dense but beyond that it's regular. The palate is racy and medium deep, but the flavors are more superficial than interesting. Finishes quick, with coffee and bitter chocolate flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"Heady plum and dark berry aromas give a warning of size and ripeness, and indeed there's a ton of ripe fruit to the palate; but the wine is also raw, untamed and lacking in mouthfeel. It could stand to flow and finish better than it does.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Compared to the 2004, this wine seems less generous. The nose is solid, with licorice, spice, pepper and plum fruit. But the palate is kind of flat and bland, with plump but dull raspberry and strawberry fruit. For $30 you want more.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Quite piercing on the nose, with unyielding cherry and hard-spice aromas. The palate is also intense, with saturated black cherry and raspberry flavors riding rough on a tight frame. Not the most friendly and easy Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Citrus blossom and pine notes are welcoming enough, but the palate is sort of sweet and gummy for Torrontes. The wine has a spritzy body but not much variety in flavor. Powdery on the finish, with sugary leftovers.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Forward and lively but challenged and pithy. The apricot and melon flavors are bolstered by acidity, but the wine tastes more citric and snappy than suave. And the finish also doesn't offer much beyond citrus. Definitely not lifeless but where's the Chardonnay character?",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A little sharp and ringing on the nose, with pine and citrus keeping it ultra fresh. The palate is mildly aggressive and zesty, with herbal raspberry and cherry flavors. With light oak and acidity kicking all the way to the end, this shows the crisp side of Pinot Noir.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Supposedly Doña Paula's top selection for 2005, and while the wine shows some earthy darkness and plenty of fruit on the bouquet it doesn't follow up with the mouthfeel or overall balance that it should. It's ripe for sure, but also aggressive, with a disjointed acid-to-tannin ratio and an almost syrupy mouthfeel.",Malbec
Argentina,"This lighter-bodied blend has a lot in common with a good Côtes-du-Rhône. It's mildly spicy but also quite fruity; the nose exudes red-berry and cinnamon aromas, while the palate is warm and just slightly oaky. A nice bistro wine.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Not a bad value. The wine is a touch reduced and short on mouthfeel and aromatics, but it still delivers creamy vanilla flavors, raspberry essence and decent density. The sum of all its parts is better than the individual components. Best now, and in casual settings.",Malbec
Argentina,"Better than jug wine even if it comes in a big bottle, with clean, lightly expressive cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. There's a little heat and roughness to the finish, but given the league that it's playing in you can't complain about the overall quality of this Mendoza Cabernet. A big-time barbecue or party wine.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Opens with a smoke shack full of hickory and jerky before settling in a dark mass. The palate is sweet and a touch awkward, with heavy Port-like weight and strange but provoking berry flavors. An odd blend of Malbec, Cab and Syrah that needs fine tuning.",Red Blend
Argentina,"For the price, this is pretty good. Not very Syrah-like, but if you enjoy plum, cherry and currant flavors along with pretty good mouthfeel and balance, you'll get it here.",Shiraz
Argentina,"Warm, earthy, leathery and grapy, with a mildly tart, underdeveloped palate that offsets any roughness with a blanket of creamy oak resulting in flavors of berries and milk chocolate. With more focus, riper fruit and less oak, this wine could better.",Malbec
Argentina,"Almost sugar-beet sweet on the nose, with a good dose of oak and size. The palate is expectedly big, but with fairly hard tannins and limited depth of fruit. Ultimately there's not much cushion, so it seems hard.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"With floral aromas, toasty oak notes and solid berry fruit, this bottling is the best among Trapiche's 2007 single-vineyard Malbecs. The palate features smoky berry fruit but also high acidity and some scour. Fortunately it's also layered and structured. Will do best with meats and fatty foods. Drink now through 2015.",Malbec
Argentina,"Warm black-fruit aromas along with earth and controlled oak give this Malbec a nice bouquet, and the palate features full berry flavors and a dark-spice accent. The finish is smooth, mellow and slightly chocolaty. Satisfying, legitimate Malbec in every way.",Malbec
Argentina,"One of the best Argentine value Chardonnays on the market. The nose is stylish, with butterscotch, honeyed apple and vanilla notes. Smooth on the palate, with more than adequate apple and peach flavors, and then pure and fairly long on the finish. For clarity and real Chardonnay character, there aren't many better options than this, especially for $12.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Best Buy wines come in all shapes and sizes. This one settles at the bottom of the category, which doesn't mean that it doesn't have its charms, namely sweet and ready fruit and just enough acidity to keep it from being cloying. Keep in mind the price and young vintage when drinking.",Malbec
Argentina,"A little sharp and unfocused on the nose, but the palate is simple and juicy, with tangy red-fruit flavors backed by good acidity and solid tannins. Overall it's healthy and ready but sorely missing that one key ingredient: finesse.",Malbec
Argentina,"A touch creamy and milky on the nose, with shy tropical aromas in support. The palate shows warm-climate melon and peach flavors on a round, chunky frame. A mild, innocuous wine if there ever was one. Drink as soon as possible.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Round, simple and easy to enjoy if you don't mind a lack of Viognier typicity replaced by chunky apple aromas and flavors. There's also some citrus and apricot to bulk up the flavor profile. Overall it's a full-bodied but indifferent white. Drink right away for best results.",Viognier
Argentina,"Coconut, green herbs and fresh-cut wood work the nose, followed by fairly herbal berry flavors. There is oak throughout, and mildly coarse tannins, thus the structure is solid.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Bold berry aromas turn a little sweet and simple with airing, while the palate deals plum and berry flavors on a tight, tannic frame. Bright and colorful but fairly rough and basic in what it has to offer.",Merlot
Argentina,"If this isn't one of the strangest, most unique Sauvignon Blancs on the market, then please tell us what is. With a tan/peach color, this wine has its own agenda. The palate pushes peach, cantaloupe and floral notes, but where's the acidity and where's the grassiness?",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Big and colorful, with soupy aromas blended with a waft of heavy berries. The palate is packed with anonymous red fruits, but the mouthfeel is pretty hard and miserly. Tastes reasonably good but has little in common with Spanish Tempranillo.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Deep as a country well, with lush black plum and blackberry aromas as well as lead pencil and balsam wood. The palate is solid but not overly tough or complex, and the flavors of cassis, berry and black cherry are more than satisfying. A pure, textbook modern red wine; drinkable now and over the next couple of years.",Malbec
Argentina,"A touch leathery and cooked at first, but with time the bouquet deftly blends saucy, savory Syrah aromas with sun-baked black fruit notes. The palate is saturated and chunky, with aggressive sweet-and-sauvage flavors of grilled meats, spice and burnt brown sugar. Roasted, warm and mildly bitter on the finish. Drink now through 2012.",Syrah
Argentina,"Quite intense, with blasting aromas of blackberry, coconut, cocoa and even leather and horse hide. It's 65% Tannat and 35% Malbec, and as a whole it's big, grabby, tight and full of blackberry and raspberry flavors that bring an herbal twist. Smoky and herbal on the finish.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Interesting floral, herb, cherry and chocolate-mint aromas are a good preview of the racy black cherry and berry flavors that rule the palate. The acidity is a bit pointed, giving the wine an edgy feel. But with elevated flavors as well as cola and chocolate on the finish it comes across nice and ready to drink.",Malbec
Argentina,"Alamos takes Merlot to the next level with this ripe, jammy, crusty offering. The black fruit on the nose is dense and pure, the mouthfeel is round and generous, and the flavors of ripe plum and berry ring true. Layered, long and easygoing on the finish. Very nice for Argentinean Merlot.",Merlot
Argentina,"This is one of the best—if not the best—yet from this producer. Alluring plum, berry and cola aromas meet every requirement of a very good Malbec, while the palate is fresh, sturdy and shows a cool mix of red fruit, chocolate and spice. Even the finish is abnormally long and smooth for an under-$10 wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pure and stout, with prime black-fruit aromas supported by toasty oak and mineral-like char. Blackberry is the lead flavor on the thick, dense palate, while the finish is solid if a little sedentary. Nicely focused and forward; probably what most people are looking for from Argentinean Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Chakana has put out many good wines in recent vintages but this rough and tumble blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Syrah  comes across minty and forced on the nose and then grating on the palate. Yes, it's got color and power. But it lacks the balance and body that you'd expect. Frankly, it seems acidified.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Big but scattered. The nose mixes incongruent aromas of green beans, chocolate and wood resin before transitioning to a palate of wood spice and generic berry fruit flavors. Too chewy, resiny and woody, and lacking harmony.",Malbec
Argentina,"Citrusy but also salinic, with mildly tart and lean lime and orange flavors. There's a touch of canned fruit character to the feel, with grapefruit on the finish. Juicy in the middle but limited.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"More chunky than some in its class, with early berry flavors but not much backing that up. The wine has a little brett and rubber, and in the end it turns lean and tight. Fresh but too sharp and thin to raise the bar.",Bonarda
Argentina,"A thick wine that doesn't bring the ripeness, sweetness and balance that's necessary. The nose is filled with milk chocolate, mint and cough syrup, while the palate is surprisingly tangy and sharp, with cranberry and wild raspberry flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"Slightly rugged at first, with strong scents of leather, earth and subdued dark fruit. The palate is classic Malbec: soft, chewy and medium in depth. Not terribly complex or long on the finish, but satisfying.",Malbec
Argentina,"A serious wine for serious wine drinkers. It's 60% Cabernet and the rest Malbec. Deep, deep and deeper is how to best describe the chewy, fruit-saturated palate, but even better, this wine has guts, balance and aging capacity. Best to hold this joint-venture red from Chateau Cheval-Blanc and Terrazas de Los Andes for at least three years.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"Saturated in color. Smells rugged, like tire rubber and tar mixed with blackberry. Beautiful tasting, with black cherry, licorice and minerality on a firm, no-flab palate. Fairly big tannins create structure; a touch of crushed pepper and burnt toast darken up the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Once you cut through the heavy, minty oak, there's a decent wine hiding in the folds. The body carries reasonably ripe black cherry and raspberry flavors as well as plenty of wood-generated tannin, but does it taste much like Syrah? I find it more generic and woody than varietal.  Imported by Excelsior Wine & Spirits.",Syrah
Argentina,"Earthy and mildly lactic on the nose, with tight, lean, herbal flavors. Doesn't rise above mediocre.",Malbec
Argentina,"This colorful, clumsy wine shows glaring powdered-drink and candied cherry aromas and flavors, and while it's kind of scouring and rough it manages to make its mark via its juicy ripeness. Not a stellar wine but has its merits; the blend is Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Bonarda.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Holds it together for the most part, but this isn't what you'd call a focused or interesting wine. The nose is mildly fruity, while the palate is shapeless and doesn't deliver recognizable Chard flavors. It rates as a generic dry white wine with hints of melon and peach.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Mildly grassy and dilute on the nose, with sweet, candied berry flavors and a sticky, woody finish. It's fairly full in the mouth, but it lacks the precision, darkness and focus of a top-flight Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Most of Bousquet's wines are enigmatic. They show some good qualities but also signs of overcropping and underripeness. That said, this wine is typical: it's scattershot in its delivery of green-infused berry fruit, tannins and wood. It's O.K. but never settles down. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Can't say that the heavy dose of oak on this wine is helping the cause. The nose is quite resiny and cloying, while the palate is creamy and full, but loaded with wood chip and vanilla flavors. As might be expected, even more oak flavor dominates the finish.",Chardonnay-Viognier
Argentina,"Simple jammy aromas lead to a hard, acidic palate offers some red fruit flavor but also an undercurrent of field greens. A lasting streak of bell pepper on the finish doesn't help bring it around.",Merlot
Argentina,"A joint venture between the Renacer winery of Argentina and Chile and Allegrini from the Veneto in Italy. Thus it makes sense that this five-grape blend is done in the Amarone style, with concentrated, dried grapes. Aromas are generous, minty and floral, and the palate is jammy and concentrated. Rich and a little raisiny, just like Amarone. Drink now.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Good from the beginning, with deep berry aromas touched up by mocha, vanilla and road tar. The palate of cassis, black fruit and light herbs is juicy and lively, and while the finish is standard in terms of feel and length, it offers oak-driven coconut and spice flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"This unusual marriage of Pinot Noir and Malbec has a familiar set of aromas and flavors. There's raspberry, tobacco and lemon peel on the nose, while the palate tastes of blackberry and tobacco, with some sweetness. Not pushy, a little strange, and overall very good.",Red Blend
Argentina,"This is the kosher version of Gran Malbec made by Flechas, and it's concentrated and rich, with an oily sort of feel along with fairly soft tannins. Aromas of roasted fruits hint at the olive, baked plum and tempered herb flavors that come later, and the finish is thick and chewy. A broad, succulent but shy Malbec. Drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"The nose is full of mellow raspberry and cherry, while the palate is fleshy and round, with blackberry and a touch of raisin. Plump, not edgy, and ready to drink, with coffee and mocha notes on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Light green in color, with standard Torrontes aromas of acacia and tropical fruits. The palate is simple and delivers solid flavors of lychee, melon and green herbs; somewhat cloying and confected.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Some wines in this range have it and others kind of struggle. This one seems to be fighting an uphill battle. The nose is unfocused and a little mulchy, while the flavors are jammy, sweet and basic. Tannin and acidity keep it cranking, but is that good?",Malbec
Argentina,"Big and black but also heavily charred and very oaky—we're talking bulldozer oak that leaves mostly resin and vanilla on the palate. Combine that with huge tannins and extract, and what should be pleasant and fruity becomes a stampede across the palate.",Syrah
Argentina,"The Torrontes character shows on the nose, meaning there's detectable lychee and orange blossom scents. The dowside is that the palate is rather thick and honeyed but devoid of flavor. Seems to be fading into the night.",White Blend
Argentina,"Pungent, rudimentary berry aromas come across as candied, while the palate is very narrow and sweet. Drying on the finish due to wayward tannins; doesn't go beyond the ordinary. Imported by USA Wine Imports.",Malbec
Argentina,"Average red juice with sweet, rubbery aromas and flavors that match. It's Malbec in its most simple state: raspberry and cherry distilled into a quaffable liquid. Chilling might help.",Malbec
Argentina,"Aromas of chewing gum, red fruits and asphalt lead to standard berry flavors, but the feel is scouring and the finish is rough. Seems like tartartic acid is the culprit here.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A strong blast of oak comes across as resin and clove, and thus the wood doesn't augment but instead takes away from the fruit. Speaking of fruit, it's jumpy and tangy, with a finish that tastes of green olives. Overall it doesn't show proper balance or full development.",Merlot
Argentina,"Very dark and charred, but at the same time it smells like a fudge milkshake mixed with espresso. It's plump but loose in structure, with generic black-fruit flavors and strange acidic kick.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Sharp and tight on the nose, and then it stays narrow and rather punishing on the palate. It's a tangy, gritty, tough wine with tart red-fruit flavors and bitter coffee note on the finish. Malbec-Syrah-Tempranillo is the blend.",Red Blend
Argentina,Waxy aromas of scented candles and canned pears define the nose. The palate is low on acid and thus tastes soft and remotely of Bartlett pear and peach. Light on the finish; thus it needs to be drunk now.,Chardonnay
Argentina,"There are fumé blancs that are oak-backed and others that aren't. This one is the former. The nose is full of toast and vanilla, while the fruit is on the ripe, weighty side, with peach, melon and lemon flavors. Fairly rich in the mouth, with whetting acidity.",Fumé Blanc
Argentina,"This old-timer proves that Argentinean Malbec is not a great cellar dweller. This smells, tastes and feels much older than its eight years. It's full of tobacco, dried spices and a dominating leafiness. The blend is 70% Syrah and 30% Malbec.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Rubbery and overly woody, and the palate really burns along with high acidity and short, staccato fruit flavors. Zesty and challenging throughout; it just doesn't push the right buttons given its reserve status and price.",Malbec
Argentina,"This Tempranillo is leafy and leathery, with light raspberry aromas backed by thin plum and berry flavors. It's an aggressive, standard red wine that's neither here nor there.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"With little to compare it to, it's hard to evaluate the correctness of this Semillon sweetie from Argentina. Let's just say that it's a weird wine that carries a vivid yellow color and aromas and flavors of honey, corn syrup and hominy.",Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Sweet berry aromas are also noticeably green and medicinal, while the palate offers raspberry flavors with a giant supplement of leafy, weedy flavors. On one hand the wine has some class and style; on the other hand questionable purity and ripeness stand out.  Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Merlot
Argentina,"This Cab is sheer and tannic, with red plums and stern berry flavors. Adequate initially but the heat and tannins soon cover the palate.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dormant and a bit chemical on the nose, with rubbery fruit and a lean body. Woody and borderline hot on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"Clean but weightless, with little substance or stuffing to it. This is a cool-climate, Patagonian Chard from young vines, hence it is reticent and watery. The winery's pricier Patagonian Select is a better option.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Something seems afoot with Sur de los Andes' so-called Gran Reserva Malbecs. Both the 2004 and epecially this '05 are wines that don't handle their oak well. This wine has an aromatic package of green tobacco and ash, while the wood burns its way through the palate. A rough ride that gets marginally better with a lot of swirling and patience.",Malbec
Argentina,"Exotic and refined, with a stately bouquet of violets, mineral and cassis. Sensational quality for a wine from rugged Patagonia. It bursts with black raspberry propelled by firm acids. Then it folds back into a darker space, where fudge and pepper notes make for a warming, spicy finish. Shows off the skill of Danish winemaker Hans Vinding-Diers.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pure and inky. The nose offers graphite, earth and a huge amount of blackberry. The ripe palate is deep and defined, with a layer or two of complexity. Finishes with oak shadings, a splash of mint, and chocolate. Because the vineyards that yield this wine are still young, expect only better things in the future. Congratulations to Clos leader Michel Rolland and his gang of seven.",Malbec
Argentina,"The inaugural premium Malbec from Montes S.A.'s fledgling Argentinean venture displays round, attractive aromas of concentrated black fruit and hefty oak. The palate is bold, chewy and rich, while fine tannins and lively acidity keep any potential holes well plugged. Tastes sweet, dark, fruity and ripe, with vanilla and coffee on the finish. Tremendously satisfying.",Malbec
Argentina,"Begins with smoky bacon aromas that are followed by ripe black cherry and blackberry. Very plump and earthy, with a flush mouthfeel and lively acidity. Severely oaked, but that wood is of quality, so it yields vanilla and pepper rather than resin or sawdust. A blend of 85% Malbec and 15% Cabernet.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tight, concentrated and deep, with rubbery aromas of black fruit and earth. The palate is rich and layered, with lemony oak setting up herbal, powerful berry fruit flavors that come with hints of tea and briar. Zesty as well as rich, and well balanced. Nicely done for Salta Syrah.",Syrah
Argentina,"Licorice and prune/raisin aromas indicate slightly baked core fruit, yet the palate is clangy and ringy, with out-of-balance acids that give the wine a clumsy burn and sharpness. Along the way there are equal flavor components of cherry tomato, raspberry and red plum.",Merlot
Argentina,"Undefined black fruit aromas are average at best, while the cherry fruit is decent but citric. This wine shows too little to warrant much attention; it's brittle but persisent, with thin, cleansing acids throughout.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"So dense up front that it hints at Port. Trouble is, there's not the stuffing or fortification of Port, so what you get is full ripeness with a soft body and hard tannic walls. Finishes heavy, with a layer of melted fudge and no balancing acidity.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dark, heavy and foresty on the nose, with astringent cherry and coffee flavors. Sharp in terms of feel, with plenty of leftover acidity on the finish. Tartaric acid is all over this wine.",Red Blend
Argentina,"This wine has never been Trapiche's strong point. It's yellowish and heavy, with a forced buttery nose. Citrus steps up on the palate and dominates, and the finish is texturally scouring.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Hard-crusted, medicinal aromas give the llama more funk than we prefer, and the palate is generic and clampy. Shows a mild burnt flavor throughout and while it's okay, it doesn't taste a whole lot like the Shiraz we've grown accustomed to.",Shiraz
Argentina,"The aromas are sort of mealy and flat, and frankly the palate keeps that tune. There's pulpy white fruit and then a flat-lining finish that tastes of dried peach and melon.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Prickly pickled aromas are offset by candied fruit notes, while the palate is thin and candied, with nectarine and other less-than-berry flavors. An edgy wine that does little for the image of the obscure Bonarda grape.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Having tasted and approved of many Chakana wines in recent years, I find this one way off the charts in the wrong direction. It's charred beyond repair, with gigantic berry and black coffee flavors that simply aren't that appealing. And it gets tougher and more sticky with airing. Note to winemaker: Back off the extraction and wood treatment.",Malbec
Argentina,"Mildly raisiny on the bouquet. The palate is round and full-bodied, with blackberry and roasted plum flavors backed by smooth tannins and a chocolaty, savory finish. Heavier and warmer than some red blends, but not clumsy or overdone.",Malbec-Merlot
Argentina,"Ripe and big, with campfire aromas and black fruit. There's a bulky molasses and brown sugar element to this wine along with blackberry and creamy mocha. Ripe and rich for a value-priced Malbec, but that said, it teeters on the verge of being syrupy. Best if you like creamy New World reds.",Malbec
Argentina,"Among Argentine high fliers this blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Tannat lacks a little. The nose is mildly stemmy and herbal, while the flavors of wild berry and cranberry are a touch reedy. Tannat and Petit Verdot are not commonplace grapes, and maybe that's why the wine seems sort of herbal and edgy despite having its good qualities.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Here is how you get Torrontés right. The nose sheds dusty lemon and apple blossom aromas, which are followed by lemon-lime and citrus flavors. The palate has solid density and stuffing, and the finish evolves toward orange and pineapple.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Shows some young-vine raciness but also the sappy red cherry that is Rio Negro Malbec. Balanced and nicely oaked, with a comfortable finish that carries both chocolate and vanilla. From the maker of Fabre Montmayou.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smells a little hot and peppery, but the palate is big and expansive, with generous flavors of blackberry and vanilla. Round on the finish, if a bit generic, and not overly identifiable as Merlot. Still, it's an attractive, spicy red wine.",Merlot
Argentina,"This is a stylish throwback, like the new Knicks putting on vintage Frazier jerseys. The nose is spicy and slightly herbal, with fresh basil, cinnamon and leather mixing with dried black fruits. Still vital and kicking on the palate, with juicy plum, blueberry, coffee and chocolate flavors. Toasty and spicy on the finish; drink or continue to hold.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A big, ripe, saturated offering, the type of wine most red-wine enthusiasts want, and also the type of wine that has earned Argentina its reputation for making serious Malbec. The color is purple, the bouquet rubbery and smoky. The palate is dynamite; the black-fruit flavors are superb and the coffee and dark chocolate nuances just right. A stud of a wine that could use about a year in bottle to reach its peak.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sharp, spiky and raw to start, with sassy fruit and aromas of smoked meat and polished leather. In the mouth, more identifiable flavors of plum, raspberry and beet take over, and time allows for it to unfold. Finishes sturdy, with perfect tannins and perky acids. Match this with grilled beef and you're on your way. Sophisticated yet antique. How nice to see an individual wine like this.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"This you just have to love, especially for the price. Starts with graham cracker, kirsch and black cherry aromas before transitioning to chocolate, vanilla and coffee. Shows subtle touches but a lot of Argentinean power and pizzazz. Restrained but ripe; robust yet suave.",Malbec
Argentina,"The nose is a dark, clumsy confluence of rubber, stewed cherry and horseradish, and the palate is both tangy and bouncy, with a hard feel and plenty of acidic kick. Misses too many marks to rate better.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"This variety doesn't seem to have adapted well to Patagonia. For starters, it has virtually no inherent Sauvignon Blanc character: it's oaky, sour and scratchy, with a lean and watery finish. It's not a foul or dirty wine; but it isn't what we've come to expect from SB.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Candied fruit aromas lead to a hard, underdeveloped palate that houses tannin and oddly flavored raspberry notes. Not a lot else to say about it.",Malbec
Argentina,"Hot and earthy up front, with mocha-like aromas. The palate and finish are syrupy, and the wine ends in a pool of chocolate and berry extract. This is an example of why Argentine Syrah has not found its groove.",Syrah
Argentina,"What else can you say about this three-grape blend other than it's heavily oaked and doesn't have the fruit or complexity to handle it? The bouquet is like a trip through the sawmill, and the palate is akin to biting into a log.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Flat and soupy, as if the life had been drained out of it. Barely acceptable, even with a big production of 40,000 cases.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Too funky, animal and vegetal to recommend. The wine has color and size but the aromas and flavors just aren't that pleasant. Tastes more like rhubarb and carob than fresh berries.",Malbec
Argentina,"It's hard to understand why Santa Julia would want to make an oaked Pinot Grigio in Mendoza, but they did. And we find it as odd and difficult to get through as you might expect. The nose is nutty and full of popcorn, while the palate offers heady, honeyed apricot and peach flavors.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Tan in color, with musky aromas. Flavors of cucumber and citrus alert you to the fact that this is Sauvignon Blanc; because nothing else really does. Overall it's a foxy, musky wine without much SB character.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Quite green and on the verge of deserving the dreaded weedy designation, this Cab fails to show much ripe fruit character even if the mouthfeel is decent. It's like a wet-vintage cru bourgeois Bordeaux.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Rowdy and aggressive stuff; where's the charm and poise, even in a value-priced wine? The nose is rambling and penetrating, while the palate is tart like sucking candy. A raw wine that should be better.",Malbec
Argentina,"A typically huge Colomé wine with initial damp, murky, funky aromas that give way to earth, roasted fruit and compost. Fortunately it's fresher in the mouth, and the wine definitely improves with airing. Still, the palate is big and oily, with roasted berry, herb and wild, exotic flavors. A unique style of Malbec from old Calchaquí vines.",Malbec
Argentina,"Potent smelling, with black pepper, lots of oak and true berry fruit aromas. The palate is a bit pointed and high in acidity, while the flavors of raspberry, currants and red plum are solid. Finishes a little jagged and acidic, but at worst that staunch acidity will keep it alive for years to come. Hold until at least 2011.",Malbec
Argentina,"From a global wine bottler named Xavier Flouret, this Torrontés is a full-fruited, oily specimen. The nose boasts lychee, perfume and acacia, while the palate pumps out melon and apple flavors. Big it is; precise it's not. But it's rewarding. “Flaca” may mean skinny in Spanish, but this wine is far from that.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Blackberry and plum aromas have just enough leather and horsehide accents to give this wine character. The mouth is centered squarely on purple fruits like plum and wild blackberry, and the feel and finish are comfortable and fresh. Lively and with all the basics in the right places.",Merlot
Argentina,"Tight on the nose, with hints of resin, lemon peel and black fruit that smell inviting when all added up. The palate is juicy, arguably a bit acidic, and runs fresh with red cherry and plum flavors. Spunky and properly tannic.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"If a Chardonnay could suffer from something called “barrel breath,” this one would. It's like a bowl full of lacquer and heady melon, and the palate is sweet, sweet, sweet. There's vanilla, marshmallow and resin along with more typical melon and citrus. A case of more being less; just too much oak and candy to rate higher.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Nothing about the El Fogón wines has been impressive. This Malbec, which should be the jewel of the portfolio, is a weak pretender with starchy, lean flavors of raspberry and apple skins. It has no body and a disjointed, buttery finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pepper, green notes and burnt caramel do not create much of a bouquet, and the flavors don't go far beyond peppery fruit and green-accented raspberry and plum. An unfamiliar and afflicted rendition of Syrah.",Shiraz
Argentina,Aromas of beets and dry spice drive the harsh nose. The palate is hard and defined by bitter pepper and cherry flavors. Too much harshness and not nearly enough core fruit or cushion.,Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"Torrontes is something we've never seen from the Trumpeter line. And maybe that's good, seeing that this is oily in the mouth, with pithy, unusual flavors coming from all directions. It's a wine that doesn't stride along with ease.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Beware of funky labeled Malbecs because many don't have much to offer. Case in point, this candied, scratchy wine with wild, rampant fruit and not much else. Tastes like a jug wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Yellowish in color, a true indicator that this is on the way out. Tastes chunky and flat, with bland lychee and melon flavors. Short then bitter on   the finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Astringent almost to the point of making it tough to drink. With aromas of raspberry and citric flavors, it's a biting wine without much Cabernet size or stuffing.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Trapiche's Broquel line has never featured Pinot Noir before, and maybe this is why. Talk about a sharp, scouring wine. It's lemony and lean, with piercing cranberry flavors and razor-sharp acidity. Crispness is one thing; sharp and edgy is another.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Clumsy at first, but admittedly tasted a month prior to release. Time frees up deep, sturdy fruit overlayed with a sheet of creamy oak that yields vanilla, resin and subtle spice flavors. Chunky and ripe; the berry fruit is 100% mature. Will knit together with more time in bottle. Better in 2006.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Deep purple in hue, with saturated dark-fruit aromas along with pinches of cola and creamy oak. Fairly concentrated for a wine of this stature; for less than $10 you get vanilla and chocolate accents atop youthful, bouncy blackberry. The mouthfeel is plump, and there's a toasted coconut flavor on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Aromatic, with blueberry and dried jerky scents. Good fruit with earthy, chocolaty nuances creates a pretty palate that follows the nose nicely. On the downside, it turns thin toward the end. But it manages to stay juicy; in some ways it tastes like Zinfandel.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"A nice wine with aromas of lead pencil, violets, black fruit and a sprinkling of lemon zest. The palate has body and a chunky outlook, while the flavors of berry fruits, spice and something slightly exotic work. A solid, approachable wine that should bring a smile to the face of any Malbec lover.",Malbec
Argentina,"A light but obvious blast of coconut opens things, followed by aromas of black fruit, vanilla and toast. The palate is fresh and zesty, with snappy acidity adding tang and zest to the flavors of plum, raspberry and cassis. Overall it's composed but sort of short, while the finish is medium long and ends with a dash of mocha. Seems a little on the lean side while still showing the up side of Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Crusty on the nose, with aromas of leather, saucy fruit and alcohol. The wine is full and sweet, with ripe, sturdy flavors of blackberry, plum and raisin followed by fudge and herbs. It blends richness with agility.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark and full-bodied, with a big bouquet of coconut, char and blackberry. The palate is thick and chunky, and that seems right given the wine's sweet black-fruit and chocolate flavors. Add in some oak, baking spice and mocha and you've got a solid, tasty, generous wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dry berry fruit and spice make for a solid but very common and regular type of nose. The palate is based on a lively bead of acids that lift and amplify the flavors of plum and cherry. A little hot but solid on the finish, thus it leaves a tangy final impression.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Chunky and full, with raisin, oak and mocha aromas. The palate comes across round and healthy, with mint and herb notes accenting plum and blackberry flavors. To justify its “gran reserva” moniker the oak is front and center, but the fruit is solid.",Malbec
Argentina,"Norton's Lo Tengo (I Got It) line has a winner in this vivacious Malbec. It's light and a little candied on the nose, but also floral and attractive. The palate is medium-bodied and fresh, with raspberry, cherry and cassis flavors. Clean, mildly tannic, good acidity: what more do want from an inexpensive, trendy red?",Malbec
Argentina,"Intense and saucy, with strong aromatic hints of barbecued meat, marinade and crushed red pepper. Deeper down there's cherry and baked plum flavors. Smooth but just racy enough, with excellent acid-tannin balance. Finishes with vanilla, pepper and fresh tomato. It's 60% Tempranillo, 20% Malbec and 20% Merlot.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Starts full and oaky, but not sappy or overly creamy. Settles to offer aromas of campfire, lavender, black peppercorn and plenty of snappy berry fruit. Fine texture and depth of flavor, with cherry, plum and vanilla. A complete wine with an intense spice element.",Malbec
Argentina,"Almost floral, but with aromas of crushed minerals and tar. Airing reveals some coconut, but swirling unleashes an onslaught of balancing snappy red fruit. Definitely an oaky Malbec, with powerful finishing flavors of coffee, bitter chocolate and vanilla.",Malbec
Argentina,"A huge amount of smoke, rubber, herbs and black fruit pour out of the nose, and that same intensity is carried onto the palate, where bright, juicy, spicy fruit is raring and ready to go. Espresso and black licorice on the finish convey power, the cornerstone of the wine. Correct and snappy; the formula for good-drinking Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Good but a step down from recent vintages. Big and brawny on the nose, with oak-based aromas of shoe polish, chocolate mint chips and mocha. The thick palate is deep, raisiny and chunky, with roasted black fruit flavors touched up by chocolate. Very good and likable, but not as thorough and alluring as it has been. 40% Malbec with 30% each Cabernet and Merlot.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Dark, piercing, crusty black fruit aromas suggest burnt toast and lemon, and although there's a lemony bite to the palate, once it airs out chunky black fruit flavors take over. Not a thriller but it's pure and clean. Textbook mid-to-upper-level Malbec with some flair.",Malbec
Argentina,"Powerful in Zinny character, this blend of Dry Creek and Russian River grapes bursts with brawny flavors of wild berries, chocolate-covered mint, tobacco and pepper, wrapped into sturdy tannins. Shows real class and character.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Opens with roasted fruit notes and an earthy character that qualifies as intriguing. The palate is fresh, wide and healthy, with cassis, blackberry and a hint of rhubarb that adds some edge. Overall this is a solid Cabernet; it finishes long and with coffee and mocha. Drink now into 2010.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"In this price class, consistency is a virtue, and year after year Santa Julia's Malbec delivers the basics and a little bit more. This wine has some up-front oak to give warmth, lemon and a mocha or root beer quality to the bouquet. The palate revolves around plum and wild berry flavors, and there's no shortage of oak and mint on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"For something a little lighter, more herbal and different than the usual Mendoza heavyweight, this multigrape blend offers aromatic notes of pancetta, herb, fennel and dried cherry along with flavors of blueberry and elderflower. It's light-to-medium in size, with a Rhône-style personality. Drink now.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Round and rambunctious, with aromas of leather, herbs, cherry and cassis. Veers toward grapey in the mouth, but holds the line while offering soft, buttery plum, raspberry and vanilla flavors. Warm and spicy on the finish, with a heaping portion of chocolate and cream.",Malbec
Argentina,"There's plenty of life in this eight-year-old blend, and the nose is like a brew of game, herbs, heirloom tomato and savory spices. The palate is plenty deep, with cherry, blackberry, cumin, oregano and raisin flavors, while the finish is forward and lively. Put it this way: this is a unique look at Argentinean winemaking circa the 1990s.",Red Blend
Argentina,"The big brother and precursor to B Crux, this wine has 70% Tempranillo, 20% Malbec and 10% Merlot. It's a big, chewy sweet wine with a lot of character as well as some heavy oak and heat toward the end. Since it's the very first wine from O. Fournier, and because 2001 was an average year, expect even better offerings in 2002 and '03.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Cranberry and sweet beet aromas are gritty but pure, while the palate pushes high-octane black fruit along with chocolate and raisin flavors. Lively in terms of feel, with very nice acidity providing balance. Finishes long and smoky, with pop.",Malbec
Argentina,"Starts with rubbery, intense aromas, but with breathing it settles on earthy berry fruit and oak-driven coffee. The mouthfeel is good and shows nice lemony acids, while the flavors vascillate between tangy/floral and herbal blackberry. Sweet, concentrated and rich on the finish, with a lasting wave of mocha.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sweet and candied on the nose, almost like a jelly doughnut at first. But with airing it turns more savory, herbal and dry. Flavors of tomato, raspberry and herbs are robust and interesting, while the finish is less so as it flattens out and seems baked. Very good but needing a bit more spunk to rate higher.",Syrah
Argentina,"Dark in color, with creamy aromas that hint at prune and chocolate. And while the wine is certainly soft and saturated, it isn't overly flabby. Still, it's ultraripe tasting, with rich blackberry and fudge flavors. Nocturnal in style, which is perfect for the jaguar (Yaguareté).",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark on the nose, with baked black-fruit aromas, graham cracker and charcoal. There's creamy oak on the palate, while the cherry, plum and herb flavors are pleasant. Finishes with fresh-roasted coffee notes and a wave of leftover acidity.",Malbec
Argentina,"Airy floral notes and a whiff of strawberry on the nose give this wine a lighter outlook, yet the palate is still fairly full-bodied as it offers ripe blackberry and chocolate flavors. Maybe a touch herbal here and there, but geneally speaking this is a solid, chewy Cabernet. 10,000 cases made.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Despite being a bit fiery on the nose, the aromas of plum and pepper come together and set the stage for solid, well-meaning black cherry and cassis flavors. First and foremost, the wine is healthy and sturdy. Beyond that, don't expect much in the way of richness or complexity.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Crisp aromas of wet stones, lime and eau de toilette give this Torrontés the proper air. It's lean and cut in the mouth, with green apple, pear and nectarine flavors coasting on a wave of bracing acidity. Finishes clean as a whistle.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Rubbery and a bit herbal on the nose, with a smack of rhubarb-like sharpness offset by deeper, more common berry fruit aromas. The palate is chunky and sweet, with meaty plum and blackberry flavors that lead to coffee and mocha on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Until now all we've tried are Callia's basic $9 varietals. So this is a big step up in intention, price and power. The bouquet is compact and sweet, with coconut, juniper and foresty aromas. Fresh and slightly grating on the palate, with spunky raspberry and cocoa. Turns more raw and rough as it expands, but overall we like this blend of Shiraz, Tannat, Malbec and Merlot.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A little sweet and candied on the nose but there are also floral aromas that are alluring. The palate is plump but offers good balance and structure, while the flavors run toward beefy dark berry fruit, spice and chocolate. Long, deep and roasted on the finish. Quite good for ten bucks.",Malbec
Argentina,"Solid, basic Malbec with plenty of fruit and power. The palate is plump, mildly oaked and tastes of honest plum and blackberry. It's ripe and round, with medium tannins and then spice, licorice and black fruit on the tail. A very good wine with no skipped beats.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tight, rubbery and smoky at first, and then it shows more vanilla and sweet berry fruit after it has opened up. The mouthfeel is nice and fulfilling, while the flavors of black fruit, nutmeg and mild toast are pleasing. Nothing too exotic or out of the ordinary here. Just good red wine at a good price.",Syrah
Argentina,"Mostly it's clean and neutral smelling, but there is a bit of candle wax and peach to the nose as well. The palate is fresh and not too weighty, with melon, sweet apple and honeyed flavors. A solid wine, especially for the price range and origin. Don't expect miracles and it should be pleasing.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Ripe, healthy and pure, with familiar aromas and flavors of cassis and berries. In the mouth, it's bright and lively, with plenty of acidity but no sheering, harsh qualities. Finishes well, and as a whole it shouldn't raise any complaints while it may please value hunters and fans of Argentina.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A little jammy and heavy at first, but airing gives it better focus. The palate runs full and lush, with sweet tannins running alongside blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors. Holds it together on the finish, but overall the wine is more generic than individual.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This new Patagonian winery is doing better with its reds. This SB is honeyed and slightly mealy; the palate starts out soft and chunky, with apple and peach flavors that are less than zesty and slightly oxidized. Still, complexity arises as there's a lasting butterscotch taste that is not unpleasant.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Basic but full and ripe, with black cherry and cassis aromas. The palate has some snap and clack to it, but flavors of raspberry are softened and enriched by vanilla and creamy accents. Shows more on the nose than in the mouth, but overall it is a nice wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Give this young Malbec some time to settle and it rounds into form. The nose goes from funky to finished in a few minutes, while the cherry and cola flavors run with ease toward a lightly tannic finish. Straightforward and likable once it finds its legs.",Malbec
Argentina,"Hailing from San Rafael in southern Mendoza, this wine—named after a shade-providing tree—is interesting and different from the masses. The nose is floral and herbal, with pencil eraser and red-fruit aromas, while the mouth is earthy and sort of Old World, with dry, lean tannins and structure.",Malbec
Argentina,"Soft and composed bouquet, with fruit aromas you will recognize and nothing funky or strained. The mouth is complete and better than ordinary, with pure but simple cassis, blueberry and plum fruit. A hint of oak allows for coffee and mocha to grace the modest finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Looks good in the glass, and with citrus essence, plum and cherry aromas, and spice notes it offers a controlled but pleasant bouquet. Cherry, plum and spice flavors work well with the wine's racy acidity and solid structure. Powerful and toasty on the finish.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Sweet, intriguing aromas of orange peel, spearmint and boysenberry jam give this individuality, while the flush palate serves up soft but ripe plum and berry flavors. Uncomplicated, with weight and adequate freshness.",Malbec
Argentina,"It doesn't take a great brain to figure out that this is a rocking, beautifully crafted international red wine. Mint, spice and chocolate aromas are dipped in lovely new oak, while the palate is all about bold plum backed by coffee and mocha. Stellar now and shows all signs of a wine that will only get better. Imported by Vias Imports.",Malbec
Argentina,"There's a mix of good and questionable here. The nose starts out gaseous and stinky, as if it's begging for air. Give it time and it settles on exotic, warm blueberry and floral aromas. The palate is downright syrupy and thick, with licorice, bitter chocolate and sweet berry flavors. Rich as they come but also soft and on the brink of overripe. Not a wine for the cellar.",Malbec
Argentina,"Like many Cafayate reds of stature, this opens with funky murkiness, leather, animal notes and baked characteristics. The blend is 70% Tannat with Malbec and Syrah, and overall it's full-bodied, snappy in the mouth, and good in terms of offering integrated plum, raspberry and spice flavors. Shows a lot of heat and burn on the finish, however. A wine with individuality. Drink now through 2012.",Red Blend
Argentina,"This is probably the best of the new line of Festivo wines from Monteviejo. The nose has a clean, fresh neutrality that serves it well, while the palate is bright and offers apricot and nectarine flavors. Turns more pithy on the finish, which is why we suggest that you drink it ASAP. Questionable value at $18.",Rosé
Argentina,"Minerally peach aromas keep things lean to start, and it's somewhat narrow in outlook throughout. The palate has melon, nectarine and papaya fruit, and there's both citrusy acid and custardy richness to give modest complexity. Like a green-fruit lollipop in liquid form.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Jammy and rubbery on the nose, but undeniably bold and friendly as well. The palate is what we'd describe as “happy,” meaning it's full, not too tannic and tasty. Flavors of cassis and ripe plum offer some fatness, and the finish is easygoing. Uncomplicated and good as a value wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark in color and that's backed up by deep earthy aromas and black fruit. In the mouth it's full and sweet, with baked fruit, chocolate and coffee flavors. Finishes with rich berry and molasses notes, and for a candied, sweet-styled Cabernet it gets the job done.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Slightly oily, nutty and harsh on the initial nose, but better as it opens and airs out. The body here is good and has balance, depth and substance, and the flavors of lychee, mango and other tropical fruits ring true. Persistent on the finsh, with good structure and length.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Concentrated, with plenty of aromatic richness and dark fruit aromas of blackberry and cassis. The palate features proper extraction and weight, with forceful, powered-up flavors of wild berry and toast. Solid on the finish, with good ending weight and legs.",Malbec
Argentina,"Black Label is a step up the quality ladder for Las Moras, based in San Juan. And this wine is full and chunky on the nose, with blackberry and plum-based aromas. In the mouth, it's more racy and oaky, teetering on sharp. But the freshness it boasts bodes well for pairing with meat, and the aforementioned oak lends a hint of cappuccino to an otherwise snappy finish.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Interesting enough on the nose, with aromas of cotton candy, charcoal, lemon peel and coffee. The palate deals the usual suspects for Cabernet: cassis, plum, tobacco and herbal accents. Competent as a whole and probably a bit above average.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Fruity but common on the nose, and acidic and sheering on the palate. No matter how many times you slide this across the palate, it seems tangy and electric. In the midst of all that zest there's bright plum and berry flavors followed by a lively finish. Tasty and cleansing, but choppy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Despite some initial sweet gummy aromas, things settle into form on the nose. In the mouth, raspberry and cherry flavors are almost in the bubblegum range but are more complex and true than candied. With freshness, nice tannins and decent structure, this wine is giving about all it can.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smells distinctly of cherry cola with a dash of lemon peel. The palate is medium-bodied at its richest, with red-fruit flavors of raspberry and cherry. As a whole it's colorful and easy to like, even if it finishes sort of thin but fresh. Good intentions; low on stuffing.",Malbec-Syrah
Argentina,"If you like a muscular, sweet, full-bodied wine with chunky wild berry flavors topped with a dollop of raisin and chocolate, this is it. It has lower acidity and therefore size and richness. For some it may be syrupy and less than exciting; others will enjoy its ripeness. Drink this year.",Syrah
Argentina,"A bit grapey and jammy on the nose, with a slight hint of bramble and stem. It's solid in the mouth, with kick and sweet berry fruit flavors. On the finish it falls off some, leaving a mildly candied aftertaste. Not perfect but overall it's a well-made blend of 85% Malbec with Cab and Syrah filling things out.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Jammy aromas of strawberry and raspberry are just solid enough to win you over, while the flavors of red fruit and cola carry a bit of tang and acidic bite. This is a fresh, lively everyday wine with sweet, standard flavors and a basic, competent mouthfeel.",Malbec
Argentina,"Full on the nose, but there seems to be some brett resulting in aromatic hints of hard cheese and leather. There's energy on the palate, with lemony notes preceding core flavors of cola, cassis and kirsch. Ripe and sweet, but with nothing out of the ordinary. Good Cabernet for the price, but not what you'd call interesting or exciting.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Saucy and sulfuric at first, but better with time. The palate amounts to a saturated fruit bomb with grip, while the core flavors of cassis and black fruits are very sweet and chunky. Bulky, broad and on the cusp of syrupy. Ripe and ready but maybe too ripe and creamy for its own good.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Some barrel influence works its way onto the largely natural bouquet, while the flavors of peach, banana and melon surf a smooth, modestly deep palate. This is better than your average Argentinean Chardonnay, especially if you like some tropical warmth and weight. Drink right away to catch its vitality.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"While all of Trapiche's single-vineyard Malbecs are excellent, this is the rock star of the group. From 50-year-old vines, Coletto offers prune, fruitcake and cedary aromas in front of a jammy but structured palate. Smooth as silk with hints of Port. A lovely, lush wine that should age well through 2012.",Malbec
Argentina,"Aromas of mocha, rubber, smoky leather and berry fruit indicate good things to come, but in the mouth this wine fails to deliver equal to its price and the previous successes of Trapiche's single-vineyard Malbec project. Scouring acidity is the main culprit; the wine seems clipped, tartaric and angular, thus it's all superficial and not deep or rich enough to rate better.",Malbec
Argentina,"Initially it gives off murky, soupy aromas. But with airing it rounds into form, displaying prune and oak scents in front of a round, soft, stewy palate of chunky berry flavors. Gets better with time before finishing with toast, herbal notes and tobacco. Offers more highs than lows.",Merlot
Argentina,"For the second straight year, Chacayes scores major points among serious Argentine wines competing for the world's attention. This blend of 80% Malbec and 20% Cabernet is deep, dark and seductive. It's all about compact, intense fruit supported by hefty tannins. Very nice and perfectly ripe. Hold a couple of years for best results.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tropical and zesty on the nose, with a big shot of lemon blossom and a secondary note of melon. The palate is juicy, fresh and sort of lean, with lemon, pineapple and green apple flavors. Arguably tart and angular, but at least it's clean and crisp.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"This vintage of Broquel reflects the cool, challenged characteristics of the '08 vintage. It has snap and berry aromas and flavors along with obvious oak, char and mocha. The palate is more driving and linear than previous years, with juicy, snappy cherry and wood at the base. Finishes with coffee, toast and controlled bitterness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tropical and toasty, with buttercup and banana on the nose. Good acidity keeps the palate zesty and moving forward, while the flavors of lemon, lime and pineapple are juicy and clean. Good in a fresh and simple way, with just a spot of oak character.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Borderline heavy, with stewy black fruit aromas that turn savory then murky and gaseous. The palate has clacky acidity and flavors of sweet, roasted berry fruits. Lasting on the finish, with citric acidity that seems as though it was forced onto the wine. 50% Malbec with 30% Cabernet and 10% each Syrah and Merlot.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Charcoal and ripe berry fruit announce this as a serious, masculine Malbec. The palate answers the bell, delivering tight blackberry and cassis flavors in front of a tannic, sturdy finish. Shows great foundation and potential; best in late 2007 into 2008.",Malbec
Argentina,"Familiar aromas of lemon blossom and air freshener get it going, and all together it smells a lot like a bathroom cleanser. Later on it shifts to lean, lemony, citrus fruits, with lime sticking out. Good and racy in the mouth, with another squeeze of lime juice on the finish. Good for Torrontés but with limits.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Savory, baked cassis and blackberry aromas show form and solidity, while the palate is deep and a little soft, with lush, slightly roasted berry and black currant aromas. Chocolaty on the finish yet not too heavy or forced. Not all that Syrah-like but it still smells and tastes good.",Syrah
Argentina,"Here's one heck of a black, saturated wine. Cola and tar aromas abound, while the palate is borderline medicinal due to its extreme ripeness. If you like a rich, sun-drenched red with heft and body, this is it. The blend is 80% Malbec and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, and it hails from vines with up to 150 years of history behind them. Weighs in at a whopping 15.5%.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Chocolate and mint with the essence of coffee drives the bouquet. In the mouth, this Malbec-Merlot blend is ripe as can be, with cassis, blackberry and chocolate all making their mark. The finish is secure and mildly tannic, while the overall take is that this is a ribald, rich South American red.",Malbec-Merlot
Argentina,"This new wine from Donald Hess of the Hess Collection is a big, bold mix of black cherry and currants. It's ripe and cushioned by full tannins and a lot of spirit. The blend is 66% Malbec, 20% Cabernet and 14% Tannat from high-altitude vineyards in Salta. Will go nicely with steak and other meat dishes. A truly excellent, modern-styled Argentine red.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Ripe and smooth, with hints of molasses, toast, and vanilla as well as mulberry and blackberry. The wine runs sweet but masculine, with chocolate as the prime secondary flavor. Finishes long and broad, with supple tannins. Made from 8-year-old vines. Drink now through 2015.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sensational wine for the money. The Cab and Merlot work together seamlessly, as the nose exudes raspberry and sweet leather. Tastes warm and toasty, with ripe fruit softened by chocolate and pillowy tannins. Argentine red at its affordable best.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
Argentina,"Not all that expressive on the nose; about all you get is basic yellow fruit and lettuce. The palate shows more intensity, but the flavors of lemon and tropical fruits are basic at best. Chunky, sweet and common on the finish. Good for Argentina but still it leaves you asking for more.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"After a few years of stumbling around in Mendoza, this Concha y Toro project seems to have found its way. This wine, albeit oaky, is full of dark fruit, dill and toast aromas. The palate is balanced and tight, with firm tannins and plenty of black cherry, plum and coffee flavors. Toasty and lasting. Shows a lot of power and purity.",Malbec
Argentina,"Not sure why a Mendoza Malbec is named Havana Rose, but that's not really important when you taste this ripe, candied wine that shows reasonable balance and character. The palate offers bright, candied raspberry and sweet plum flavors, and the finish is warm and full. About all you can ask for in a $9 wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big, fragrant, lightly oily and tropical, with zingy, lively acidity pushing lemon and green melon flavors. The finish is round, a little pithy and solid, and overall this strikes us being the quintessential quaffing white for the summer and early fall.",Torrontés
Argentina,"This new casual wine from Valentin Bianchi is solid with full berry aromas. The palate is round and a little soft and plump, with prune, fig and blackberry flavors. Sweet and easy throughout, with a mild finish. Nothing out of the ordinary.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"For Argentine PG it's attractive. The nose is clean but simple, while the palate is fresh and easy, with driving pineapple and lemon flavors being pushed along by good acidity. Juicy and wet on the finish, and overall it ranks as a nice, fruity wash.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"A balanced Malbec with red fruit aromas and just a touch of aged cheese on the nose. The palate is creamy and slightly candied, with layered black fruit, fig and chocolate flavors. Creamy and candied but lively on the finish, with enough integrity and structure to rank as a Best Buy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Granular, raisiny and heavy on the nose, with jammy blackberry aromas. The palate then hits with a thud; it's chunky and low in acidity, which yields a thick flavor set of prune and coffee. Better once it breathes, but it's still a bit too sticky and syrupy for our liking.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lovely up front, with lavender, licorice and pepper accenting live-wire blackberry aromas. Jammy and extracted in the mouth, with pure berry flavors. This is a mountain of a wine that doesn't pull its punches. Expect weight, tannin and extract but also a lot of flavor.",Malbec
Argentina,"Violet in color, with persistent, potent aromas of mint, marzipan and black cherry. This is not your run-of-the-mill soft Malbec; on the contrary, it's peppered with piercing acidity, which yields a can't-miss freshness. Flavorwise, we're talking zesty boysenberry and raspberry.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smooth, fruity and a touch earthy on the nose, with pure raspberry, plum and cassis in proper doses. Quite comfortable across the palate, where juicy acids wrestle with full tannins. Finishes big, with chocolate.",Malbec
Argentina,"Iscay means “two” in a native Incan language, and it represents the wine's composition of 50% Malbec and 50% Merlot. The wine is intense and inky, with aromas of mocha, black fruit, asphalt and rubber. The palate is juicy and lively, with full but not too aggressive tannins. Very nice but not as interesting as the single-vineyard Malbecs.",Merlot-Malbec
Argentina,"Starts with roasted, heavy aromas of rubber, prune, shoe polish and toasted wood. The palate shows pretty good texture along with flavors of blackberry, herbs and prune. Solid but basic, with minimal complexity and depth.",Merlot
Argentina,"A little stewy on the nose, with vanilla, liqueur and roasted berry aromas. The palate is young and vibrant, arguably teetering on sharp, with piercing cherry flavors and lots of oak. Flavorful but rough, with burnt brown sugar on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Round, dark and slightly baked on the nose, with quasi-syrupy and creamy berry flavors that have plenty of the label's “oak cask” character. The finish is endowed with mocha and toast, and overall it's your textbook, good, regular Malbec from Argentina.",Malbec
Argentina,"Earthy up front, with a heavy, mildly herbal set of berry aromas. The palate is juicy and fairly solid, with fresh red-berry flavors accented by a dose of creamy vanilla. Long on the finish for basic Merlot, with an herbal lasting impression.",Merlot
Argentina,"Normally a wine with this score and price would earn front-line Best Buy status. But because it's brand new and total production is only 600 cases, you're going to have to work to find it. But if you do, expect a melon-driven wine with clean lines, good acidity and a long finish. It's refined Torrontés; aromatic and complex to the point that you might mistake it for a Rhône Valley Viognier or something similar.",Torrontés
Argentina,"An excellent wine for the money. All of Basso's current wines are rock solid, including this blend of Cabernet and Malbec, which shows jammy berry aromas backed by plump blackberry and strawberry flavors. Solid and flush throughout, with nary a flaw.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"An impressive encore to the 2002. This wine hits with a bolt of leather, graphite and blackberry before moving on to a pure, tasty palate that's loaded with concentrated berry flavors. Very bright and bouncy, and just a level below the Lurton brothers' studly Chacayes.",Malbec
Argentina,"A modern-styled Malbec even though it comes from 33-year-old vines grown in a cool subsection of Mendoza. The aromas are warm, smoky and earthy as they set the stage for bright boysenberry and currant flavors. Balanced and sturdy, with fine natural acidity. Drink now through 2015.",Malbec
Argentina,"Subtle and smooth from start to finish. The aromas are sly but sturdy, with mocha and blackberry sticking out. The flavor profile is pure black fruit with underlayers of spice and chocolate. A ripe, really good example of approachable Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Deep purple in color and rich on the nose, with bacon, roasted berry, rubber, spice and heft. The palate is thick and round, with smooth edges and flavors of bacon grease and roasted black fruits. Sweet and spicy late, with a lasting flavor of savory barbecue. Hard to peg as Cabernet Sauvignon but not a bad wine if you like yours lusty and rich.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Floral and tropical aromas are a direct reflection of the 75% Torrontés in the blend. There's also lychee, another Torrontés byproduct. Otherwise, it's lean and tangy, with tangerine, lychee and green melon flavors. The more it opens the more it smells like a kitchen cleanser. But the forwardness and snap are admirable. Contains 15% Viognier and 10% Chardonnay.",White Blend
Argentina,"Big, roasted and full, with slightly earthy, burnt aromas to go with standard berry fruit. The palate is solid in feel, with herbal berry and tea flavors along with zesty acidity. Finishes toasty and a little herbal, with any leftover fruit heading quickly to the shadows.",Malbec
Argentina,"Salentein, after a few years of finding its way in Tupungato, has hit the mark with this tobacco- and spice-driven Syrah. The bouquet is ripe, with a hint of prune and earth, while the palate is full, juicy and full of berries, vanilla and coconut. Modern and woody, but satisfying.",Syrah
Argentina,"Granular aromas of berry, earth and tar precede a vivacious, rather deep palate of lumbering, chewy black-fruit flavors. It feels right, sits right, and tastes right while leaving chocolate and nutmeg on the finish. Fairly classy and definitely well made. Only 400 cases made.",Malbec
Argentina,"Always one of the best Malbecs for the money. This French-owned estate doesn't cut corners, so you get a serious red wine that's heady, vigorous and authentic. The color is perfect, the bouquet smoky and penetrating, and the taste of berry fruit, spicy wood and vanilla convincing.",Malbec
Argentina,"Meaty and slightly savory, with roasted aromas and spice notes mixed in. The palate is rich and ripe, with blackberry and fudge-based flavors. It's also rather different than the average Malbec: the flavor profile doesn't just feature jammy berry fruit. There's smoked meat, raisin and other interesting things going on.",Malbec
Argentina,"An unusual blend of Riesling, Albariño and Sauvignon Blanc that is largely neutral on the nose and then waxy, honeyed and pithy in the mouth. Along the way there's an appealing dry, melony, petrol character and some good old-fashioned tang. A breed unto itself.",White Blend
Argentina,"Starts out with nice aromas of ripe black fruits and toasty oak, however it drops down in class in the mouth, where pointed, jabby acidity causes tang and sourness. There are good berry and plum flavors to offset the tartness, but it finishes narrow and snappy. Pretty good but needs better balance and structure.",Malbec
Argentina,"On one hand you'll find bacon, rubber and smoke aromas, but on the other there's stem and murky notes that bring it down. The palate has sharp acidity and flavors of roasted red berries and pepper. For a Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend, it seems lean, stemmy and wanting.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A touch stemmy on the nose, but in the mouth it comes around. The flavors are in the plump, pithy zone (think orange rind and grapefruit peel), while the finish is zesty but also pithy. Registers as your typical full-styled Malbec rosé that is o.k. on its best day.",Rosé
Argentina,"Fairly brambly and a little sour on the bouquet, with prickly fruit aromas. The palate is just as sharp and angular, without much cushion to fall back on. Flavors of cherry and raspberry are slightly herbal and tart, while the finish is more of the same. Not as round and ripe as you'd expect for an $18 Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Monteviejo, one of the Clos de los Siete wineries, has entered the unofficial “fun Malbec” category with Festivo, which has a stemmy, slightly burnt character that is present from start to finish. Along the way there are leathery black fruit flavors, herbal qualities and a good mouthfeel. Decent wine but decidedly herbal and stemmy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Starts with jammy, dusty, simple aromas of raspberry and strawberry. The palate has both a juicy front edge but also a creamy middle that houses lactic-tasting pie cherry and strawberry flavors. Regular stuff for simple sipping, nothing more.",Malbec
Argentina,"Simple and peachy, with a mix of sweet and citric flavors. Tastes candied and tropical, with banana coming onto the finish along with orange and pineapple. A lot of fruit and flavor; just not much sophistication. A quaffer, pure and simple.",White Blend
Argentina,"A wine of character. The bouquet takes time to unfold, dealing earthy aromas and desert sage. Flavors of black cherry and cassis are firm and forceful, while the tannins are pronounced. A little clumsy and rugged now; should be better in a year or so.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Savory and ripe. The nose starts with earthy fruit combined with leather and mushroom. The palate is deep and full, with notes of brandied cherries, sautéed porcini and chocolate. Fades a bit on the finish, leaving coffee and bitter chocolate. Very good, with just the slightest herbal character.",Malbec
Argentina,"Mildly dusty and herbal on the nose, but not the least bit green or weedy. Flavors of tobacco, cassis and blackberry carry accents of cedar and vanilla, while the soft tannins make for a full, easy mouthfeel. Aged 18 months in French oak but it's not overly toasty or dark.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A very nice wine given the price. The nose features a likable combination of dense berry and leathery spice, while the palate is juicy, ripe and full of black fruit. Not ultra complicated or complex; it's just pure, ripe Malbec in its most approachable form.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smells a lot like fresh celery and/or asparagus, with vibrant green fruit aromas and lettuce thrown in for good measure. Juicy in the mouth, with apple, citrus and green veggie flavors. Turns more vegetal the longer it goes, but freshness and acidity keep it on a solid plane.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"A little out there on a limb, with ultra-tropical aromas and limited flavors. It starts out fine in the mouth, and then come basic citrus, sweet pineapple and melon flavors. Tastes a lot like powdered sugar on the finish, but lasting acidity manages to cut through the candied sweetness.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Berry, pine and cinnamon aromas make for a good opening, while the palate is lean yet endowed with solid plum and black cherry flavors. Quite pure and streamlined, with full tannins and perky acids. This is not a fat, flat New World Cabernet.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Smooth and ripe, with woody aromas of toasted coconut and vanilla. The palate is all black cherry and cassis, while the finish is smooth and easy, with a light wave of mocha at the base. Overall it's an integrated wine with balance.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz
Argentina,"An earthy specimen, with leather and crude-oil aromas blended with dark fruit. The palate is extracted and chewy, with berry and cherry flavors that should please. With its body and thickness, it registers as a modern-styled red.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sometimes price is not indicative of a wine's overall quality, and this appears to be a case in point. The nose is dry, cheesy and overly oaked, and the palate is downright screeching with acidity, so much so that there's a sour flavor and scour to both the palate and finish. Too much tartaric acid? You bet!",Malbec
Argentina,"Like many of this winery's bottlings, this is heavy and raisiny. However, amid all the thickness and extract there are lusty, robust roasted black fruit flavors and candied darkness. Baked on the finish, which feels hollow and doesn't last long.",Syrah
Argentina,"Piercing leather, berry and foresty aromas lead to a zesty palate of medicinal cherry and raspberry flavors. The acidity here is high, and so there's some tartness and scour to the palate and finish. Tastes pretty good but rides rough and bumpy.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Novus is a label to watch if you're into well-made, full-force wines that are balanced and easy to drink. The current Syrah features berry aromas in front of cassis, berry and plum flavors. It isn't particularly varietal or foxy, but it is solid, masculine, dark and chocolaty.",Syrah
Argentina,"Among the small field that is Argentinean Tempranillo, this is a standout. The nose is full, meaty and ripe, with bacon in the mix. The palate is full-bore and delivers a blend of cherry, cola and coffee flavors. Big but balanced, and not to be confused with something Spanish.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Aromas of pithy citrus and pineapple are decent but unrefined, while flavors of tangerine and pineapple are tropical, zesty and what they are. This is nothing more than a fresh, simple, citrusy white to sip on the patio. Anything beyond that would be stretching it.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Generic to the max, with simple white fruit and lettuce aromas. The feel is wet and juicy but nothing more, with simple green fruit flavors of melon, apple and kiwi. Bland but decent if well chilled.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Harsh and less than clear on the nose despite a lack of oak. The palate is pithy and hot, with bitter apple and apricot flavors in front of a similarly pithy finish that brings banana into the fold. Sweet and heavy on the finish, which isn't all that surprising given its 14.5% alcohol level.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Varietally correct on the nose, but weak, with lychee, tropical fruit and Fantastik cleanser aromas. The palate fails to hold form, yielding an oily, heavy feel along with lemony, mealy flavors. Pithy on the finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Hot and rubbery on the nose, and while it doesn't smell bad it doesn't persuade you to go further. The palate has size, but it's not smooth as the acids dominate. And the flavors of berry and cherry are generic and almost impossible to identify as Syrah. Forgettable wine with tartness.",Syrah
Argentina,"Light years better than the winery's basic Malbec, this single-vineyard, reserve-level wine shows oak and power on the nose along with bright cherry. The palate deals red fruit and moderate sweetness, while chocolate works the finish. A serious wine that weighs in at 14.5%. Only 500 cases produced.",Malbec
Argentina,"Starts with coffee and burnt toast, and next comes deep blueberry, black plum and spice flavors. Begins racy on the palate and then mellows into cushy softness. Good in its depth of flavor, with chewy tannins.",Malbec
Argentina,"Chunky, flat and stemmy on the nose, with herbal, generic fruit aromas. The palate is o.k. but sort of scratchy, while the flavors veer toward herbal, roasted cherry and berry. Herbal and sort of sweet and heavy on the finish. Pretty much what you'd expect for a $10 Cab.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Roasted, oaky and resiny on the nose, and then the palate delivers a bolt of acidity that makes the wine feel pointy in the mouth. The flavors are herbal and resiny, with foresty black fruit at the core. Creamy and sticky on the finish, and overall it struggles to present a pure, balanced picture.",Syrah
Argentina,"A hot and fiery wine from San Juan province that mixes stewy barnyard aromas with black cherry. The palate has a syrupy, sugary feel and medicinal, creamy, baked berry flavors. Peppery on the finish, but with a medicinal aftertaste.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Chunky and generic smelling, with a nutty, oily palate that isn't purely focused or clean. The palate has some bitterness and excess weight along with fading lychee and melon flavors. Not a terrible wine for $9 but the low price doesn't erase its flaws.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Dull and dilute, but painless. The palate is chunky but with enough acids to stay lively, and the flavors of green apple, lemon and pineapple are decent enough. Tangy and slightly bitter on the finish.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Smoky and rubbery smelling, with brambly, mildly stemmy fruit aromas. The palate is plummy and red in character, with herbal raspberry on the back side. Dry, tangy and herbal on the finish; adequate at best as a whole, even at $9.",Syrah
Argentina,"Bland and chunky, with aromas of talcum powder and apple. The palate feel is a mix of spritz and heft, and the flavors of melon and peach are pithy and lean toward bitter. Dusty and heavy on the finish, an indication that it won't last long and has already seen better days.",Bordeaux-style White Blend
Argentina,"A good and interesting red from Salta. The blend is 80% Barbera with 20% Merlot, and the final result is positive. Cherry, plum and earth work the nose, followed by cherry, raspberry and cassis flavors. A thorough, different type of wine for those looking to explore what's lurking on the fringes of the wine world.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Violet in color, with chunky, ripe aromas of earth and berries that win you over. Structured and full, but also dry and layered. The fruit comes across ripe, while on the finish everything folds into a nice little square. Not spectacular but very easy to drink and enjoy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fans of ripe, round Chardonnays should look no further than this. The apple, pear and melon flavors are nice and sweet, with hints of butter and toast backing them up. Good on the palate, with body and texture. An easy drinker.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Snappy, prickly, red-currant aromas fail to improve with airing. The palate is high in acidity, creating a sheer feel to the cherry and raspberry fruit that drives the flavor profile. Drying and hollow on the finish. Very regular wine, with bramble and tartness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark, crusty aromas mix with sweet coconut on the nose, while the palate seems lactic and oaky despite fairly pointed acidity. Berry and plum flavors are entirely regular, and the finish is sharp due to the aforementioned acidity. A bit leafy tasting as well.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Burnt rubber, roasted generic berry and rooty tobacco aromas define the nose, which sets up a tangy, sharp, angular palate that shows little more than tart, quick cherry and raspberry flavors. Short and light on the finish.",Merlot
Argentina,"Flat on the nose, with neutral, slightly floral aromas. The palate is zesty and tart, with midland flavors of lemon, sour apple and lime. Chalky but o.k. on the finish. A one-dimensional white with hardly any lasting potential.",Pinot Gris
Argentina,"Incredibly candied and sweet smelling, much like cotton candy or pink marshmallows. The palate has a cloying, sticky mouthfeel and flavors of raisin, milk chocolate and herbal, tart berry fruits. Creamy and carob-like on the finish. Tastes and smells affected.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Jammy and murky smelling, and lacking clarity and zap on the nose. Surprisingly, the palate is jacked up with acidity, and thus it's sharp in the mouth and strained. Flavors of red fruits are made creamy by forced oak, yielding a milk chocolate note to the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Stemmy and earthy, as it smells like a mud puddle with herbal fruit mixed in. Tastes more like bitter, rubbery cherry than anything, and it's hard and dry on the finish, with a lasting flavor of baked beans. Not the worst thing going but not very good either.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Aromas of light raspberry and cookie dough are a bit sweet, but taken together they are attractive. The palate delivers snappy berry flavors and plenty of tannic kick. It loses a touch of focus as it opens but at $10 it offers more than enough quality.",Malbec
Argentina,"A nice step up from previous vintages; this affordable Syrah sports dark-fruit aromas and muscle, while the flavors veer toward jammy blackberry. Not a tannic, spicy, complex wine; instead it's easy as pie.",Syrah
Argentina,"A better overall ride than the more oaky Koch Cabernet, this bottling, aged 13 months in barrel, is crisp and fruity, with firm tannins that clamp down on the finish. Along the way there's bright raspberry and pie cherry flavors that are fresh albeit stark.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Blackberry, tar and other dark notes coat the masculine bouquet, while cherry and cassis work the palate. This is a solid, big wine with structure; it's also fairly tannic and hard. Has its merits; pretty full and rugged.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Light, tropical but ultimately dilute, with chalky, drying, tart flavors that run toward lemon and underripe pineapple. Lemony on the finish and monotone.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Not bad on the nose, where you get some tropicality, buttercup and flower blossom. But once you get onto the palate things go south. The acidity is high, creating tangy, lemony flavors, and all totaled there's not much here besides generic citrus and water.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Aromas of applesauce, lemon cake and lychee are probably the best part of the wine. In the mouth, it's chunky and wan, with candied, sweet apple and melon flavors. Finishes heavy, and overall it seems to be on an early fade.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Maybe this wine is already past its prime, but given that we aren't that familiar gauging barrel-aged blends of Sauvignon Vert, Pinot Gris, Chard and Torrontés, all we can say is that it comes across odd, resiny and heavy. Barrel notes and mustard flavors aren't all that great, and overall it's chunky, soft and tastes strange.",White Blend
Argentina,"Dusty, flat and cidery on the nose, and then heavy and clunky in the mouth, with flat, bland mildly bitter citrus and apple flavors. Finishes broad and pithy, and maybe a bit oxidized as well.",Pinot Gris
Argentina,"Much of what's wrong with Argentinean Chard is on full display here. The nose is stalky, hot and oily, with little freshness of fruit. And the mouth is hot and grating, with stemmy, bitter apple and citrus flavors. Tolerable on a good day, but is this really what the consumer wants?",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Vanilla and a dusty hollowness define the nose, and then comes an extremely sweet and sugary palate that almost makes your teeth and jaws hurt. Very sweet and unctuous, and thus it's to be avoided if dry whites are all you drink.",Torrontés
Argentina,"This jumpy, lively Malbec is a hulk that starts with funky aromas of wet dog and bacon before settling to reveal bold blackberry and plum notes. It's saturated and solid in the mouth, where black-fruit flavors dominate. On the finish comes spice and mocha. A full-force wine that needs time in the glass to show its best.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fairly dense on the nose, with aromas of coffee grounds, leather and beef stew along with berry fruit. The palate is true, with plum and brambly berry flavors. However, the feel is a bit choppy due to sharp acidity. A good blend that will do well with food.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A tiny bit heavy and soupy at first, but the palate brings things into perspective as it delivers sweet berry and spice flavors and only modest acids and tannins. It's a wine for now, with lasting jammy notes that are generally quite pleasant.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"Slightly brambly but otherwise dominated by strong red-fruit aromas and flavors. The palate is fairly rich and full, as it should be, with chocolate and herbal/pepper notes sneaking in. Doesn't have a lot of finish or sweetness. Pretty good mouthfeel and core acidity.",Malbec
Argentina,"For Argentine Sauvignon Blanc, Toso's version is nice. There's light green-apple aromas in front of green melon and grapefruit flavors. Finishes fairly full and grabby, with likable flavors. Not to be confused with Sancerre or anything, but solid.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Winemakers Hélène Garcin and Patrice Levêque have coaxed a ton of character from 70-year-old Malbec and Cabernet vines, and the result is juicy but dark, with asphalt and tar aromas sitting in front of tight but generous black fruit (cassis and blackberry). Finishing notes of coffee, mocha and char leave you happy.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Generic at best, with lemon and pool water aromas that aren't about to stir many smiles. The palate is flat almost to the point of mushy, with dull lychee and green apple flavors.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Green, grassy and not very appealing. There's a can't-miss murky, green, herbal character here that yields almost weedy fruit flavors and carob. Sweet, candied, green and just not that good for a Paul Hobbs-made wine.",Merlot
Argentina,"Off the grid in terms of aromas, which hint at blueberry and candy but don't seem right or familiar. The palate is grainy and jammy, with raisiny flavors as well as souring acidity. Herbal and then bland on the short finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Wines like this are why Argentina would be best served sticking to reds. This has no bouquet to speak of, and the palate is dilute, tangy, citrusy and sharp. Acceptable but that's it.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Yellow and chunky, and definitely on the way toward the grave. Mustardy aromas are severely short on freshness, and the palate is just as flat, dull and mealy as the nose. A weird, low-acid blend of Chardonnay, Viognier and Chenin Blanc.",White Blend
Argentina,"Smells like a can of green beans, or maybe it's canned peas. Either way, the nose is a siren call of what's to come: celery, acid, lime, asparagus and canned peas. No thank you.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"If the color doesn't tell the full story, the nose will: it's impeccably perfumed, round and sweet, with amazing fruit aromas and a toasty background. The feel is as lush and rich as they come, and there's outstanding purity to the lusty black fruit flavors. A masher with elegance. Maybe the best Malbec Argentina has ever produced. Drink from 2011–15.",Malbec
Argentina,"The nose displays some tree bark and sawmill, but underneath there's savory spice alongside black fruit. The palate is ripe and deep, with berry essence and clove. Dark chocolate carries the finish, which is firmly tannic but not overly hard.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tannat by nature is a hard, brooding grape, and this version from northern Argentina's Salta region is funky, with olive, horse hide and plenty of dark-fruit aromas and flavors. The palate is leathery but proportioned, with spice and length. Could use a touch more cushion, but hey, that's Tannat.",Tannat
Argentina,"You don't see much South American Tannat outside Uruguay, but this one scores points for its dark charcoal and cola nose as well as its deep black cherry and plum flavors. Yes, it's kind of hard and tannic, but it's also got some verve and length to it. With meat, it would be worth the gamble.",Tannat
Argentina,"Nicely put together, with a solid blend of spice, leather and smoked meat vying with juicy berry aromas. The palate is tangy and fresh, with flashy cherry flavors. Finishes strong, with coffee and chocolate. A good wine for the money; recommended for everyday Shiraz.",Shiraz
Argentina,"A full-octane wine with notes of olive and berry on the bouquet. It runs bright in the mouth, with zippy cherry and cassis flavors. Later on you detect olive at the core, but that's admirably covered by a blanket of fine oak. Good in its class.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Freixenet, the big cava producer from Catalonia, Spain, has entered Argentina via this cutely named winery. The wine, however, is pretty much your standard-fare Malbec. The nose and palate are fruity and bold, while the finish offers spice and coffee. Good but not up to the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"This funky Argentinean Pinot pours on the rubber, turned earth and heavy fruit aromas, and then backs them up with a full, meaty, starchy palate that's loaded with dry cherry and red-pepper flavors. A robust, grabby wine with virtues and question marks.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Fairly smooth and berry dominated, with almost rubbery fruit flavors that are at once tangy and satisfying. In terms of mouthfeel it's a bit hard and tannic, especially given the depth of fruit. But the flavors and intensity are there.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Having tasted the 2002 through the 2005, the '04 seems bright by comparison, with aromatics that include forest floor, tar and lively berries. The palate, like all the Poesia wines, is mouthfilling and substantial; flavors of black cherry, boysenberry and mocha are knit together and don't skip a beat.",Red Blend
Argentina,"The youngest of the Poesia line shows some new oak in the form of sawdust aromas and espresso and mocha on the finish. In between those oak-based characteristics are mineral and black-fruit aromas as well as lush, very potent plum and berry flavors. With midnight darkness, firm tannins and straggling wood notes, we suggest sitting this bruiser down for another two to five years.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Stately, stunning Malbec with alluring aromas of balsam wood, flower petals, cocoa and cola along with major league berry action. The palate is saturated, pure, tannic and loaded with blasting berry fruit, licorice and more. Let it age for at least another year or two (maybe more). Then let it rip with a porterhouse steak.",Malbec
Argentina,"Probably the best value in high-end Malbec from Argentina is Trapiche's single-vineyard series, which in 2006 was led by this bottling from an Uco Valley vineyard. It's lush, perfectly ripe and full of cola, black fruit and intensity. There's nary a chink in its fiber, and the rush of fruit that hits the palate followed by layers of subtleties is impressive. Great with grilled meat; drink now through 2015.",Malbec
Argentina,"From a 50+-year-old vineyard in La Consulta in the Uco Valley comes this bold, seriously built Malbec. Black cherry and coconut aromas settle in nicely, followed by forward raspberry, mocha and coffee notes. Great acidity, tannic foundation, structure and fillings; it's like a happy house. Drink from 2011 through 2015.",Malbec
Argentina,"Varietally floral, with spice, tropical fruit and citrus on the nose. Clean and wispy on the palate, with touches of lemon extract, banana and pineapple. A zesty, easy white wine; best as an apéritif.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Black cherry, citrus peel and a touch of charcoal and grilled meat make for a solid nose. Ripe blackberry and dark plum work the palate, while coffee, licorice and spice grace the firm, grabby, mildly tannic finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"The price on this perennial bargain brand from Valentin Bianchi has crept up in recent years, and thus its value potential has stalled somewhat. But it's still a fruity number that once it opens and settles delivers jammy aromas and solid red-berry flavors. We like that it's neither candied nor weedy. 60,000 cases proves that good wine can be made in quantity.",Malbec
Argentina,"An entirely different breed. The nose hints strongly at bacon and spice, but it also weaves in subtle red-fruit notes. Out of the ordinary on the palate, too, where cherry flavors are light but savory. A touch odd and slick, but good because it's not standard.",Malbec
Argentina,"From the onset this wine struts its stuff. The nose amounts to a magnetic blend of cola, spice and exotic dark fruit, while the palate is intense with driving black cherry and blackberry flavors. Yes, there's a touch of blatant oak that sits on the palate and lasts through the finish, but the bet here is that it will dissipate with a little more time in bottle. And the wine's spice and cinnamon notes are star level.",Malbec
Argentina,"This wine is much better than most in its class. The blackberry, graham cracker and exotic spice notes are particular to Bosca, while additional notes of bacon, chocolate and nutmeg add to the pleasure. For anyone looking for quintessential Argentine Malbec at a good price, we say start here.",Malbec
Argentina,"Get by the opening notes of leather, bitter root and horseradish and what lies beneath is a top-notch Malbec-Cab Sauvignon blend that shows tons of old-vines boysenberry and cassis character. It's a bit juicy and exacting on the palate, but it's also cleansing and will never be confused for fat and misguided. A true Argentine high flier, yet the newer vintages ('03, '04 and '05) are even better.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Ripe, bulky and fruity, with simple, granular aromas. The mouthfeel is full and warm, but generally speaking the balance is where it's supposed to be. Smooth and chocolaty across the palate and onto the finish. Shows power and density.",Syrah
Argentina,"Aromas of melon and baby powder are light but attractive, while the peach and citrus flavors are wet, zesty and fresh. Finishes with dried-fruit flavors and a sprinkle of minerality. Commendable for its simplicity.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Light strawberry aromas lead the way, with a touch of almond candy as background. The palate is fruity but nondescript, with tangy acidity and good mouthfeel. This is a perfectly competent rosé, especially for Argentina, which isn't really known for the style.",Rosé
Argentina,"Quite basic and innocuous. The nose offers simple berry and plum, but nothing exciting. The palate is earthy, fruity and solid; but again, nothing out of the ordinary. And it's short on the finish. Good but leaves you wanting more.",Malbec
Argentina,"Since Aurelio Montes of Chile crossed the Andes three or four years ago to make Kaiken, the Ultra line—be it Malbec or Cabernet—has been a consistent performer. This vintage pours on the rich, extracted aromas of black fruit and cassis, and then follows that up with similar flavors. It's full-bodied but not necessarily a heavy wine, with sweetness and chocolate but not much nuance or complexity. Drink now–2009.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Chakana strikes again with this excellent value-priced Malbec. The nose hits firmly with smoke and rubber before settling on ripe black fruit notes. Then the palate holds form, with blackberry making its mark before chocolate fills the void. Great depth and purity for a wine not meant to be complicated.",Malbec
Argentina,"Jumpy and leathery at first, although time in the glass settles it down. The palate offers blackberry as the lead flavor, although there's some lemon peel and citrus in the background. Finishes simple and short.",Malbec
Argentina,"Argentinean Tempranillo is a slippery slope, as evidenced by this mossy, olive-ridden red that has its moments as well as its faults. Positives include a nice spice element and good intentions. But beware of the herbal flavors and rock-hard mouthfeel.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Fairly earthy and stewy, but not too baked to suffer. The palate is expectedly chunky and meaty, with full-weight dark fruits and some rooty depth. Fairly easygoing and likable, but a tad muddled.",Malbec
Argentina,"Starts out with bubble gum and sweet candy aromas, which are followed by black cherry flavors. Seems a little hard and grating at first, although airing does open it up. Ultimately it's a basic Malbec with good flavors and adequate mouthfeel.",Malbec
Argentina,"Robust red wine, with ever-changing aromas of earth, leather, baked fruit and more. Shows glimpses of complexity amid standard, chunky Malbec flavors of plum and blackberry.",Malbec
Argentina,"Blackberry and cassis aromas share the bouquet with tougher, more masculine notes of earth, rubber and char. Once it opens on the palate, there's ripe raspberry, plum and a nod to the black side of the fruit spectrum. Finishes with a mild kick of tannins and the essence of coffee and pepper. A solid blend of Cabernet and Merlot from the improving Uco Valley.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
Argentina,"The bouquet on this bold red amounts to one big blast of fruit, nothing more or less. The palate matches the nose, with black plum, blueberry and cola flavors. Broad in the mouth and fiercely tannic. Spirited but a little untamed.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Year after year I taste this wine, and it always seems oaky and short on fruit. That said, it's a balanced, serious wine from well-tended vines, and it's made by folks who care. If you take the plunge, look for coconut and vanilla from the oak and dry fruit with touches of tomato and herbs.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Light up front, with slight floral and banana aromas. Flavors of lemon and apple are short and clean, while a tangy finish closes it out. Fairly big for Torrontes but not offering much in the way of character.",Torrontés
Argentina,"This rosado is made from Bonarda and Malbec grapes. It's a touch vegetal on the nose, with hints of vanilla to sweeten it up. The palate is tart and dry, with peach, nectarine and apple flavors. Decent feel and body keep it afloat.",Rosé
Argentina,"Simple earth, rubber and berry aromas come prior to cranberry, plum and cherry flavors. Finishes quickly, with drying tannins. A tight, limited wine that won't offend or excite.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A typical New World Chardonnay in that it starts with corny aromas that are matched by heavy toast notes. Act two is an ultra sweet palate that seems more sugary than ideal. Very tropical as well, with sweet mango and pineapple flavors. Too sweet to be convincing as a dry white.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Lightly waxy, with inoffensive but innocuous floral aromas. The palate shows citrus candy and weight, while the finish is more or less the same. Registers as a pulpy, chunky white as opposed to something lithe and snappy.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Black plum, cola and chocolate define this textbook Malbec. The wine has body, heft and lots of fruit, but also some complexity and character. Flavors of black cherry, plum and cassis are layered and fairly boisterous, while the mouthfeel is firm and just slightly tannic. Just right for red meats and pastas.",Malbec
Argentina,"Initial aromas of clove and cinnamon suggest a lot of barrel action, but give it a few minutes and the wine settles on ripe black fruit, dark spice notes and richness. It's big-boned but not overly tannic, and it exhibits Shiraz's bacon and espresso character in a good way.",Syrah
Argentina,"Cola, blackberry and cassis dominate the bouquet, with cedar making a cameo. The palate shows no shortage of tannins, while the flavors yield to the usual suspects: cassis, black fruit, etc. To call it a young buck would be accurate. It's tough, robust and tannic, yet there's a lot of fruit and power to uncover.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"The nose is forceful and strong, with char and the dark-fruit aromas that Shiraz and Malbec are known for. The palate pops along, propelled by healthy acids and moderate tannins. And the finish is fairly plush before it fades away quietly. A little more depth and length and we'd really be singing this wine's praises. As is, it's a rock-solid blend.",Shiraz-Malbec
Argentina,"For a lighter-bodied wine, this sure shows a lot of aggressive, resiny oak. The nose has sawmill qualities, while the palate is woody and spicy, with apple in the background. Seemed better in 2004; wasn't nearly as oaky.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A wine that's seriously muscled up with tannin and oak. That's what you get with this rugged Argentinean Cabernet that comes with leafy notes of tobacco and mint along with raspy, grippy berry fruit. Maybe another year in bottle will help; now it's not that pleasant.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Scattershot aromas of wet paint and berries are the opening salvo. Acid-based red fruit carries the palate, while the mouthfeel is electric to the point of overbearing. Tastes alright but doesn't have the cuddly feel or lushness that's the signature of a good Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Starts with aromas of strawberry and raspberry, but to be honest they're a touch green and grassy. On the palate, there's plum and chocolate, and late in the game it's all about milk chocolate. Not complex but decent.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dry and toasty on the nose, but tart, racy and raspy on the palate. The raspberry and cherry flavors are sharp and fall off to dry and lean as the wine progresses.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Pungent grapefruit aromas carry the aggressive yet fragile nose. Sheer and citric in the mouth, with sharp lemon-lime flavors. Zesty almost to the point of scouring.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"This global brand has a hit in Mendoza. The '06 Malbec is lively and made right, with hickory and charred steak aromas mixing nicely with the blueberry and blackberry character in the wine. It's a darn good New World red for not much cash, and it should hold up well for at least a couple of years.",Malbec
Argentina,"Ripeness is apparent from the first whiff of blackberry and prune. Yet the palate features tangy flavors that lead straight to a rubbery, almost bouncy finish. Full for sure but not very polished.",Bonarda
Argentina,A gold-colored heavy wine with butterscotch and apricot aromas followed by a tangy palate that features a beam of acidity running through the middle. Remains tangy and narrow through the finish.,Chardonnay
Argentina,"Not a lot of ambience to talk about. The nose is almost peanutty in its murkiness, while the flavors of cherry, burnt toast and green pepper are less than impressive. Not an overly bad wine; it just fails to impress at any juncture.",Malbec
Argentina,"Modest, unfocused tangerine and passion fruit aromas lead to a plump, flat palate with dried apricot and passion fruit flavors. Seems soft on the finish, as if the acidity is low.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Foresty and damp on the nose, with just a touch of standard red fruit propping things up. Runs leafy and dry in the mouth, with a hard, almost bitter finish. Too tough and tannic to really enjoy.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Gets out of the blocks with grassy, almost murky aromas. The palate is loaded with clipped, pinched fruit that's overly acidic and leaves a harsh impression on the cheeks and tongue. A wine that needs better balance and more.",Malbec
Argentina,"A lot of funk on the nose, and it never really goes away. Aromas of burnt coffee, sulfur and charred meat are less than attractive, while the palate runs weedy. Just too shaky and off to rate better.",Malbec
Argentina,"Mint and tomato blend with red fruit on the nose. The palate is tight and tannic, with limited cherry and cassis flavors. Finishes dry and blanched, with little to offer.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"In general, we've been liking Bosca's wines. But this Cabernet is murky and tomatoey, with too much stagnant character to earn a better score. Not really up to par.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Hard and spiky on the nose, and not a whole lot better in the mouth. The flavors are tart and juicy, while the lean finish is ultratangy and sharp.",Malbec
Argentina,"The color and aromas stir intrigue, but the brutally sharp palate that runs on steam-roller acidity does it no favors. Succulent to the point of sour, and giant to the point of overdone, this wine needs to head back to the garage for a tune-up.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Smells lifeless, with mild bitterness and banana flavors. Sort of waxy on the finish, despite sharp acidity. Not as good as the winery's basic Torrontes.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Fairly smoky at first, with background aromas of varietally appropriate game, leather and animal. The palate mixes some earthy, more nuanced flavors such tree bark, baked plum and bitter chocolate; the finish is clean, stout and medium long. A good wine with pure dark fruit flavors.",Syrah
Argentina,"A lot of different aromas are vying for attention; there's spearmint, potting soil, tobacco and black fruits. The palate is saturated and pretty deep for what can best be described as a “value” wine. Flavors of blackberry and dark plums are wholesome and tasty. It's nicely balanced on the whole, with medium tannins.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz
Argentina,"A cool quality runs through the dark-fruit bouquet, which has notes of leather and earth in reserve. The palate is forward and fruity, and it settles on the finish with a touch of plushness and a little chocolate flavor. Straightforward, and with some depth. This is a nice Argentine Tempranillo that happens to be organic.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Earth and leather aromas give it some personality, while violet, plum and blackberry form the base of the bouquet. The mouth is a touch rough and drying, but it houses both red and black fruit flavors along with chocolate. Lighter in weight than its Mendoza competition, but that's Patagonia in a nutshell.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
Argentina,"Mildly roasted and leafy, with dry berry aromas. This is ripe and juicy on the palate, with berry, black cherry and mocha flavors. Finishes almost creamy, with honest structure and medium-range tannins. Drink now.",Merlot
Argentina,"Leather, charred oak and mineral carry the nose, which also offers some generic black-fruit aromas. The palate is firm and tannic, thus the early session of cassis and blackberry is preferable to the tail-end notes of buttery oak, tannin and burnt coffee.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Citrus, acacia blossom and patchouli oil give this an interesting and true-to-Cafayate bouquet. The palate delivers a shot of lychee fruit along with   tangerine and melon, with lemon meringue pie to finish. One of Argentina's better Torrontes; drink now.",Torrontés
Argentina,"There's a sweet center to the bouquet, but surrounding it are more complex notes of mushroom, rubber and roast meat. The palate features ripe, clean blackberry and cassis flavors, while the finish shows piercing tannins. Shows some weight and tannic build-up at this point; drink now and into '09.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Round, melony and driven by aromas of pears and apples, this internationally styled wine should strike a chord among casual Chardonnay quaffers. It's kind of sweet, a little bit fat, and it finishes smooth. True to the blueprint in many ways; think California and this will complete the picture. Imported by Excelsior Wine & Spirits.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"More syrupy and chunky than ideal, but still a good wine with grilled meat, root beer and berry extract on the bouquet. The body seems a little baked and heavy, with molasses and raisin flavors mixing with blackberry. Finishes with melted brown sugar and soft tannins. A full, deep wine that shows a few signs of being overripe.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark and fiery, with grapy, heavily extracted aromas. Compared to the winery's Premium Cabernet, this is harder and more choppy, with staggering tannins and heat on the finish. It's a monster with teeth, and only time will tell if it finds a friendlier place. Hold for a couple of years.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Mildly smoky and toasty aromas lead to a lightly oaked palate that's largely defined by black cherry and some rich berry syrup. It's a full, colorful Syrah with a chunky mouthfeel and a satisfying but short finish. Drink now.",Syrah
Argentina,"Starts out with ripe dark-druit aromas, while pepper and charred beef come later. The palate is best up front, where black cherry and dark berry flavors attack well but lose steam fairly quickly. And the finish holds onto some buttery oak that one might rather not taste. But overall this is an easy 50-50 Argentine red blend.",Shiraz-Malbec
Argentina,"Green apple and lemon work the clean, easygoing nose, while the palate has jump and bounce along with citrus and peach flavors. Don't look for complexity or nuance and you'll be happy with the wine's vibrancy.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Starts out murky and sweaty, before showing cola, green herbs and leather. It's a rather jumpy, scattershot wine with plum and boysenberry flavors and a grapy, flush finish. The feeling here is that Terrazas wines were more consistent and elevated a few years ago.",Malbec
Argentina,"Better than most Argentinean Sauvignon Blancs, and made in a fuller-bodied style. The nose has weight and wax aromas, as well as melon, and the palate features ripe, almost pithy citrus. Dried apricot and a nick of passion fruit work the finish. Drink immediately.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"A touch cooked and oaky, but with a sweet, friendly side, too. The palate rests on beefy fruit, and it's chewable and just slightly herbal in nature. Finishes leathery and tannic, with chocolate and coffee notes. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A perennial Best Buy among Argentinean Torrontes, Santa Julia always puts out a true and consistent product. The nose on the 2007 offers lime and flower blossoms, while the weighty, slightly creamy palate shows melon and papaya. Made in a riper, fuller style. Drink now.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Generic black-fruit aromas are bolstered by chocolate and char, while the palate throws up extraripe cassis and blackberry flavors. The palate shows good acidity and ample body, and while the tannins come across hard on the finish, food will help it along.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Patrick Campbell, the man behind Laurel Glen in Sonoma County, has a fondness for Argentina and South America. His Terra Buena brand has some hits and misses, and this Malbec falls right in the middle of that range. It's sweet, big (14.5% alcohol) and decadent, with candied fruit flavors and a soft, fudgy finish. Drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"Touches of cola, cherry and berry work the jammy bouquet, and the reasonably sturdy body offers up flavors of berry backed by vanilla. There's ample grab and pretty good balance to this fresh wine.",Shiraz
Argentina,"The nose exudes popcorn, butter and spice, while the palate is downright resiny. In between all the barrel (or is it stave?) influence, the wine shows moderately plump pear and apple flavors. But the oak is always dominant, with the mouthfeel as the wine's saving grace.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Tons of color, fruit and weight add up to a big, fun but clumsy hunk of generic red wine. With a slightly slick feel and not much structure, it's a wine that's meant to go down easy.",Merlot
Argentina,"Sweet and a little foxy on the nose, with secondary aromas of air freshener. The flavors are a touch brambly and herbal, while the palate is flush and chewy but also a little tannic and choppy. Doesn't seem as thought this is as structured and serious as it was, say, four or five years ago.",Malbec
Argentina,"A little reduced and granular on the nose, with black fruit and licorice aromas filling any gaps. The flavor profile is solid, with black cherry and plum pulling the cart. Where this wine comes up short is in mouthfeel; it's tight almost to the point of sharp, with a strong essence of grape skins and tannin. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",Malbec
Argentina,"Clean, fruity and a touch candied on the bouquet. The palate is narrow but saved by ripe black cherry flavors and spice notes. Finishes with a mocha-like flavor and a crisp, clean feel. A basic but more than satisfactory Malbec. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA Inc.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lightly tropical, with peach, citrus and pineapple aromas. The palate offers mostly sharp citrus flavors of lime and orange, and the finish holds onto that theme.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Aromas of talcum powder, tangerine and melon are decent, while the palate offers round and mildly edgy citrus and passion fruit. Finishes with some zest and pink grapefruit. A legit but limited wine; drink now.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Butterscotch, roast corn and a general aromatic flatness don't really bring you in, but the flavors of pear and peach are adequate, and the palate has some acidic kick to it. Mouthfeel and flavorwise, the wine is fine, but it has no complexity, character or pedigree to it.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"From the San Juan province, this lighter-framed blend offers a hint of mineral and honey on the nose, followed by racier orange and green melon flavors. As a whole the wine is perfectly clean but insipid. It's tangy, sheer and clean but lacks body and soul.",Chardonnay-Viognier
Argentina,"A lot of detectable oak here with earthy, cooked fruit and a flat overlay of barrel. In general, something seems missing.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Aromas of sweet melon and honey suggest an innocuous quality that's confirmed on the palate, where basic apple and pear flavors come across a bit sweet. Finishes with some scour and a little harshness.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Lightly brambled and ever so slightly green, with pleasant strawberry and raspberry aromas. The mouthfeel is a touch choppy and grabby, but it's not too thin and rough to make it unpleasant. Not bad for the price.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Rhubarb and tomato leaf are strongly present on the nose, followed by grassy flavors and a hollow, thin mouthfeel. Septima is Spanish-owned, and this 800-case bottling seems like a nod to the homeland. But it tastes anything but Spanish.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Lightly tropical on the nose, yet nutty and fading on the palate. There's some dried fruit flavors and some acidity to keep it hopping. But in the grand scheme of things this doesn't come close to taking over center stage.",Chardonnay-Viognier
Argentina,"The bouquet has a lot of burnt character, particularly rubber, and the palate has too much corn, citrus pith and peach pit. Shows vibrant acidity but little finesse.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Overripe. The nose has thick citrus and cantaloupe aromas, while the palate shows chunky melon and citrus juice. Extremely round but limited in terms of what it offers.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"The sweet and floral aromas may be too close to air freshener to be convincing. Almond candy, orange and dried apricot flavors work the palate, which finishes lemony and on the pithy side. Drink now.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Volatile at first, with more than a hint of vinegar to the nose. Airing helps it along, revealing brambly fruit along with tough tannins. Smells too much like a dairy; barely worth a look.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Port, anyone? This is a prune-filled, raisiny wine. Naturally, it lacks balance and mouthfeel, which is replaced by a grating, starchy feel. Overall it has a few redeeming qualities and an okay finish.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Smells like raspberry or strawberry Kool-Aid, with appropriately “funky” flavors of rhubarb, raspberry and burnt sugar. The mouthfeel is rather scouring and acidic.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Brambly and sour on the nose, with berry jam in support. The wine gets leaner and meaner as it expands, finishing with raw tannins, buttery false-tasting oak and additional bramble.",Shiraz
Argentina,"Phebus is a new label from Fabre Montmayou, and frankly this wine has issues. It smells a lot like gumballs and a wet, dirty dog. It doesn't have much substance or flow, and that gamy, wet-dog character is persistent, even on the flavor profile.",Malbec
Argentina,"Almost transparent in color, with leafy, lightly baked aromas. The palate offers tart raspberry and hard, citric tannins and acidity.",Merlot
Argentina,"Rustic yet complete, with dark, sweet aromas of toasted coconut, mint and berry syrup. The palate is juicy and balanced, and that's really the key in distinguishing the top Bonardas from the more frequently found hard and scouring ones. In our book, Broquel is a Bonarda you can count on.",Bonarda
Argentina,"A hulk of a wine with forced oak that results in aromas of mint, char, citrus peel and smoke. The palate is endowed with ample black cherry, raspberry and mocha flavors, while the finish mixes orange peel, chocolate and a lot of leftover wood resin. Interesting but very oaked up and not quite in perfect balance.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Heavily coated with coconut and oiled leather aromas, however, the palate recedes to Bonarda's typical angularity. The flavors of blackberry and cherry are solid, but the mouthfeel runs rough and sheer. And it finishes with some saltiness and leather. A good wine, not without its fault.",Bonarda
Argentina,"This vintage seems more medicinal and overtly ripe than the more balanced 2003. It has high alcohol (15.2%) and medium acidity, thus it's a touch gummy and syrupy. But if you like power at the core of your Cabernet-Merlot blends and you don't mind a little fire in the hole after drinking, then we recommend this chewy, ripe, very modern offering.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
Argentina,"Pretty decent for a Mendoza Pinot, but still challenging on the nose and in the mouth. Leafy, rhubarb notes blend with berry fruit aromas, while the snappy palate has some raspberry sharpness but isn't piercing or painful.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Tough cherry and plum aromas lead it off, followed by simple, semitart raspberry flavors. There's not much depth or complexity; the palate bounces along inoffensively, and the finish is quick and light. Clean and basic wine.",Syrah
Argentina,"An unusual specimen, especially on the nose, where spicecake, floral and incense aromas are atypical. The palate is kind of sharp and immature, with grapey, blueberry flavors and coconut on the finish. A different breed of Malbec, but not what we'd call a slam-bang success.",Malbec
Argentina,"A bit herbal and brambly, with baked, earthy red fruit aromas. Modest raspberry flavors are mostly what you get off the narrow palate, and the finish follows suit as it fades out with a tight, herbal character. Rudimentary Cabernet.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Light in color, with neutral semi-citric aromas that are clean but innocuous. Candied in the mouth, as if there's a bit of residual sugar in the wine. Flavors of sweet apples and citrus are more than acceptable, and as it winds down it comes to a modest, easygoing conclusion.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Opens with pleasant, semiexotic blueberry and herbal aromas. The palate is bright and snappy, with moderate weight and balance and then fairly bright red berry, vanilla and herbal notes. Forward, lean and simple Malbec. Gets the job done.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big, rubbery and smoky, with exotic fruit aromas that seem roasted. The palate is tough, tannic and clipped, with herbal, thick flavors of berry, baking spices and coffee. Finishes big but flat and hard, with lasting herbal flavors.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Funky and sharp at first, with aromas of a dog fresh out of the rain. The palate is choppy and a bit hot, with sharp, generic cherry flavors along with some carob. Finishes with angular, tart flavors and notes of coffee and mocha.",Malbec
Argentina,"Chunky on the nose, with flat aromas of apple and peach. The palate has a melony feel and sweet flavors of mango and mandarin orange. Finishes sort of heavy and tropical, with a little leftover heat. Good enough but highly regular.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Smells a bit waxy and grassy, with mild, distant white-fruit aromas. The palate feels pithy and chalky, with generic citrus flavors and then citrus pith on the back end. Finishes with more pithiness and white grapefruit.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Warm and saucy aromas suggest a bit of leafiness and volatility. The palate is rather tannic and somewhat hot, with leafy, herbal cherry and raspberry flavors. Finishes similarly, with pepper and herbal flavors.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Hefty but kind of flat on the bouquet, with tomato and herb aromas. The palate has tannic bite and dark, candied flavors of sweet berry and burnt brown sugar. Finishes peppery, with a lingering candied, burnt sweetness.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Fairly bland on the nose, with only a pinch of mild peach and candle wax. The palate is full but wholly generic in terms of flavors: look for sweet pineapple in front of a soft, almost cloying finish. Drink now.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Dark and showing a heavy set of raisin, stewed fruit and black cherry aromas. Lush and cushioned on the palate, while the flavors run jammy and a touch pruney. Coconut, vanilla and peppery accents control the moderate, somewhat lazy finish.",Merlot
Argentina,"Simple pineapple, mango and peach aromas lead to a plain palate of orange peel and lime. The finish is similar, as this wine fits the description of easygoing. Beware: it is softening as we speak, so drink immediately.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Not sure why a Mendoza Malbec is named Havana Rose, but that's not really important when you taste this ripe, candied wine that shows reasonable balance and character. The palate offers bright, candied raspberry and sweet plum flavors, and the finish is warm and full. About all you can ask for in a $9 wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big, fragrant, lightly oily and tropical, with zingy, lively acidity pushing lemon and green melon flavors. The finish is round, a little pithy and solid, and overall this strikes us being the quintessential quaffing white for the summer and early fall.",Torrontés
Argentina,"This new casual wine from Valentin Bianchi is solid with full berry aromas. The palate is round and a little soft and plump, with prune, fig and blackberry flavors. Sweet and easy throughout, with a mild finish. Nothing out of the ordinary.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"For Argentine PG it's attractive. The nose is clean but simple, while the palate is fresh and easy, with driving pineapple and lemon flavors being pushed along by good acidity. Juicy and wet on the finish, and overall it ranks as a nice, fruity wash.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"A balanced Malbec with red fruit aromas and just a touch of aged cheese on the nose. The palate is creamy and slightly candied, with layered black fruit, fig and chocolate flavors. Creamy and candied but lively on the finish, with enough integrity and structure to rank as a Best Buy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Granular, raisiny and heavy on the nose, with jammy blackberry aromas. The palate then hits with a thud; it's chunky and low in acidity, which yields a thick flavor set of prune and coffee. Better once it breathes, but it's still a bit too sticky and syrupy for our liking.",Malbec
Argentina,"Prickly red-fruit aromas open the show, and after that it's briary. The palate delivers a choppy feel along with herbal, briary fruit flavors and earthy soupiness. Finishes with some burn, but overall it's still a decent, drinkable wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Light in color, with transparency, something you usually don't see with Malbec. The nose is rubbery, saucy and a touch grassy, while the palate is tannic and grabby, with stewy, rustic, roasted berry flavors. Finishes with the taste of barbecue sauce.",Malbec
Argentina,"Charred and smells of coffee, toasted oak, minty berry fruit and earth. The palate is quite tannic, with creamy vanilla flavors along with candied berry fruit and lemony zest. Exhibits mostly faux oak and window dressing, but for $11 it isn't bad.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Black cherry and cassis aromas are dark and a little sharp, while the palate smacks down hard with rubbery tannins and forward, sappy cherry and black plum fruit. Dark, tannic, tough and flavorful. As Bonarda goes, this is right in the middle of the field.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Snappy red berry aromas and some heat define the nose, while a lean, tight, acidic palate pushes forward with racy raspberry and cherry flavors. Clamps down on the finish, but always shows good zest and crispness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smells a bit too much like canned fruit and applesauce, while the palate is heavy, chunky and tastes of creamy, baked white fruits. Thick and decadent, with ample oak, vanilla and spice.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Sweetly fragrant, with hints of pear and melon. The palate is wet, lean and acidic, which helps push the lychee and melon flavors. A clean, light, mild refresher with sharper-than-expected acids. Nothing more than that.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Vanilla and toast aromas are prominent but the fruit is so subdued that overall the wine is out to lunch. Snappy and showing okay acidity in the mouth, but the flavors are dull and melony, with toasty vanilla notes that don't help it enough.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Light and tomatoey in color, with dry, cheesy, earthy aromas. The palate is dilute but has sticky tannins, and the flavors are tangy, citrusy and not overly sound. Finishes roasted and clumsy. An awkward wine.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah
Argentina,"Neutral on the nose except for mild hay and/or straw aromas. The palate is a bit weighty for being so short on flavor. Speaking of which, the wine is clean but tastes hollow, with only sparse flavors of peach and nectarine registering.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Floral, sweet and powdery smelling, but pleasant. The palate is light and airy, with hardly any punch or kick. But that serves it well, and amid the sheets there's lime, green-apple notes and tropical shadings. Not bad for the price.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Raw on the nose, with a hard, tannic palate that features sweet black-fruit flavors, a chemical burn and raisin. The more time you spend with it, the darker and more raisiny it becomes. Finishes roasted, with licorice and rock-hard tannins.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Neutral smelling with a hint of lemon-lime and children's vitamin. The palate is wet but doesn't bring much more in the way of feel, while the flavors are flat, melony and hint at apple. This wine is old by PG standards but not yet dead. It's hanging in there.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Neutral on the nose except for a smidgen of lychee and citrus. The palate is standard and generic, with bland peach, melon and pithy flavors. Finishes light and peachy, with weight and fading acidity.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Earth and rubber aromas dominate the nose, which isn't what you'd call fresh or inviting. The palate improves only slightly, with piercing acidity pressing green-leaning plum and berry flavors. Oaky on the finish and marginal overall.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fairly muddled and earthy at first blush, with a leafy, raisiny, burnt set of aromas. Tastes and feels mealy, with roasted cherry and raspberry flavors and then a leathery finish. Hints at quality but doesn't bring it home; and it seems tired.",Red Blend
Argentina,"An odd bird on the nose, where floral, lavender aromas replace the normal set of cassis and berry. In the mouth, it's so tannic that it's like chewing nails; the flavors, therefore, seem choppy and hard, like roasted blackberry and sugar beets. Very woody and mentholated, too.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Smells candied and gummy, with sweet, stewy red-berry aromas along with carob. The palate is fairly full and tannic, with cooked, herbal berry flavors that carry over onto the finish, which folds in coffee and grabby tannins. Good enough but sort of stewed and candied.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Medicinal, soupy and not fully clicking. The nose is fishy and the palate has a grating feel and flavors of dried fruits, cola and caramel. Finishes with a toffee-like sweetness and wayward buttery flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with a foxy, jumpy, jammy set of aromas. The palate is also jammy and amorphous, with candied berry flavors and a drab, tangy, almost peppery finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Creamy, bland and short on kick, aromas and flavors. The palate is spongey and tastes of creamed apple, light herbs and white pepper. It's inoffensive but not worth much attention. Finishes a bit vegetal as well.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Starts with roasted, heavy aromas of rubber, prune, shoe polish and toasted wood. The palate shows pretty good texture along with flavors of blackberry, herbs and prune. Solid but basic, with minimal complexity and depth.",Merlot
Argentina,"A little stewy on the nose, with vanilla, liqueur and roasted berry aromas. The palate is young and vibrant, arguably teetering on sharp, with piercing cherry flavors and lots of oak. Flavorful but rough, with burnt brown sugar on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Round, dark and slightly baked on the nose, with quasi-syrupy and creamy berry flavors that have plenty of the label's “oak cask” character. The finish is endowed with mocha and toast, and overall it's your textbook, good, regular Malbec from Argentina.",Malbec
Argentina,"Earthy up front, with a heavy, mildly herbal set of berry aromas. The palate is juicy and fairly solid, with fresh red-berry flavors accented by a dose of creamy vanilla. Long on the finish for basic Merlot, with an herbal lasting impression.",Merlot
Argentina,"Big and blasting on the nose, with heat and burn. The palate is high-wire boysenberry and a lot of acid, and ultimately it borders on sour and fiery, which probably isn't the intention. Wiry and piercing for a pricey, 800-case-production Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Year after year this rosé fails to inspire. It's flat and already a bit spent, with creamy strawberry fruit and little vital acidity. Tastes o.k., doesn't offend, but won't last long.",Malbec
Argentina,"If you catch this wine soon, meaning before it goes belly up, you may like its peachy simplicity and ample palate weight. Lychee, melon and spiced-meat flavors are interesting up to a point, and the finish is generic, soft and clean. Drink immediately.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Low-volume wine with light, dry, red fruit aromas. Red plum and tomato flavors with a short, lean feel. Basic on the finish, but stays on course. Is what it is: light, generally fresh and short on fruit.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Hard, crusty aromas loosen a little with time, but then you get pool water and foxiness. The palate is rough and lean in fruit content, with lactic, caroby notes accenting herbal red-fruit flavors. Peppery late but also sweet and resiny in the end.",Shiraz
Argentina,"Lush, pure, welcoming and sturdy, with dense black fruit aromas leading to a healthy, racy palate that's full of live-wire blackberry and cassis flavors. Seriously stacked Malbec with no timidity and a finish that oozes layered black fruit, chocolate and complexity. Drink this winter or hold until the fall-winter of 2011. 3,000 cases made.",Malbec
Argentina,"Still the most impressive Pinot in Argentina, the #32 car is showing a purple color and lots of young oak, menthol and leather on the nose. The palate is lush, deep and cushioned, while the flavors are youthful but revolve around black cherry and ripe plum. A toasty, dark, modern wine with a lovely, silky, pure texture. Best from 2012–2016.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Smells resiny and a touch chemical, with cornflakes and vanilla bean notes. The palate is resiny and dusty, with sweet, candied, vanilla-infused flavors that crowd out any fruit that might want to make a stand. Finishes with faux oak notes and more vanilla.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Weak and brambly smelling, with mustardy aromas along with leathery red-fruit scents. The palate is astringent, with tomato, basil and stewed berry flavors. Finishes in similar fashion.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Loud, oily and almost caustic on the nose, with a chemical burn. The palate is better due to its tangy citric flavors, but it's still jumbled and oily, and the finish leaves a burnt-tasting residue.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Roasted and leathery on the nose, without much fruit. The palate is full, rubbery and baked tasting, with herbal berry flavors. Finishes cooked and heavy as well, with a sauciness that overrides any freshness of fruit. A downer compared to the fresher 2008 version.",Malbec
Argentina,Sweet cotton candy and mocha aromas come across as confected and work to obscure a high-acid palate that offers a slight hint of chocolate and mint. More oak comes up on the finish.,Syrah
Argentina,"Strained on the nose, with dirty fruit aromas, gaseousness and candy. The palate is cloying and confected, with muddy, jammy, herbal fruit flavors and a cooked, weedy finish. Bulky but not very good.",Merlot
Argentina,"Roasted and muddy smelling, which isn't uncommon for Cafayate Malbec. The palate is heavy, murky and leafy, with roasted beet and plum flavors. Saucy and herbal as well.",Malbec
Argentina,"Black in color, with a severe, jammy nose that's ominous and heavy. The look and bouquet portend the flavors, which are thick, raisiny and pruney. This is over-the-top heavy and extracted, with an inky outlook and subpar balance.",Malbec
Argentina,"Herbal, green, stemmy Merlot with sourness and compromised aromas, flavors and mouthfeel. Tastes bitter and on the harsh side, with a narrow, grabby finish. Too green and mean, especially for $20.",Merlot
Argentina,"Smells like corn and a burning hay field, and the palate has little to no fruit left. The mouthfeel is wet and grabby, while the finish is bready then turns bitter. On its last legs; wait for 2010.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Vegetal from start to finish, as the aromas begin with tomato and bell pepper. The palate is exactly the same, with baked, earthy, sweet and green flavors. Feels gummy in the mouth, and it's not just herbal on the finish, it's green.",Malbec
Argentina,"Thin and sharp as broken glass, with an herbal, sour flavor profile and a tart, sheering mouthfeel and finish. Compared to previous vintages when this wine impressed, this is a loser. Barely drinkable, it's so lean and sour.",Malbec
Argentina,"A bit sweaty smelling, with pinched grapefruit aromas and distant citrus. The flavors say generic apple and lime, and there's a flatness to it. It's a little sugary as well. OK for a wine with pronounced low acidity.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Smells like a burning hay stack, and otherwise it's neutral. The palate has heft but little else, and the flavors of baked apple run resiny and sweet. Finishes mealy and dull; just another in a long line of uninspiring, mediocre Argentine Chards.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Big and over the top, with chunky, bland aromas of baked apples and overripe citrus. The palate is full, thickly textured and dull, with chunky, generic citrus and apple flavors. Finishes mealy.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Smells like drugstore-quality chocolate mint candy, meaning it's creamy and confected. The palate offers a clash of chubby softness with needling acids, while the flavor profile revolves around faux mint, cotton candy and sharp plum skins.",Malbec
Argentina,"The clean look, nice bead and good mouthfeel are the saving graces here, because it smells strange, almost like steamed ballpark hot dogs, and it tastes odd and innocuous, like papaya juice. The look and feel are good but the smell and tastes are not so great.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Aromas of milk chocolate, candy, field greens and dusty red fruit are less than convincing. The palate has high acidity and a lean body, with flavors of carob, pepper, spice and basic raspberry. Sweet and light on the finish.",Merlot
Argentina,"Burnt, edgy and stemmy/stalky from start to finish. The nose gives off a charred nut and asphalt character, while the palate is edgy, hard and bitter, with briary flavors of roasted fruit and stems. Questionable and compromised for the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"Yellowing in color and smelling waxy and peachy. This has become fleshy and sweet, with a syrupy feel. Drink it now or wait for a fresher vintage.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Mint, mocha and a slight grassiness define the nose. The mouth is narrow and sheering, with high acidity pushing tart, underdeveloped generic berry flavors. Finishes in numb, dull form, with lagging berry flavors that fail to excite.",Malbec
Argentina,"Deep purple in color and rich on the nose, with bacon, roasted berry, rubber, spice and heft. The palate is thick and round, with smooth edges and flavors of bacon grease and roasted black fruits. Sweet and spicy late, with a lasting flavor of savory barbecue. Hard to peg as Cabernet Sauvignon but not a bad wine if you like yours lusty and rich.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Floral and tropical aromas are a direct reflection of the 75% Torrontés in the blend. There's also lychee, another Torrontés byproduct. Otherwise, it's lean and tangy, with tangerine, lychee and green melon flavors. The more it opens the more it smells like a kitchen cleanser. But the forwardness and snap are admirable. Contains 15% Viognier and 10% Chardonnay.",White Blend
Argentina,"Big, roasted and full, with slightly earthy, burnt aromas to go with standard berry fruit. The palate is solid in feel, with herbal berry and tea flavors along with zesty acidity. Finishes toasty and a little herbal, with any leftover fruit heading quickly to the shadows.",Malbec
Argentina,"Black fruit aromas blend with rubber to give the impression of hot tar, while the palate is higher in acid than expected, leaving a flavor profile of zesty raspberry and black cherry. Heat and black licorice stir up the finish. Decent but limited.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Chunky and a bit dull smelling, with apple, melon and peach aromas. Papaya and green melon flavors seem to be flattening with age, and the finish is long but nondescript. Drink now or wait for the '09. Imported by Alamos USA.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Peachy aromas are friendly, while the palate has a good feel to it along with green flavors of melon, lime and fresh veggies. Finishes with fruit, dryness and a touch of bitterness, yet in the end it fails to deliver on the promise of the bouquet.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Dark, gummy and full of heavily applied green oak, this wine has a candied, murky, resiny persona. And that's too bad, because it has potential; yet the tannins, wood resin, mesquite and beefy black fruit are all too dominant and thus it never settles or shows much harmony.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"The “oak” in the name is appropriate because this one is draped in unctuous, heavy, burnt aromas. The nose is a cloud of coconut, char and woody blackberry, while the syrupy palate is all sweet black plum, carob, mint and resin. Quite oaky and thick for a value-priced wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Scented candle, green herbs, mushroom and anonymous white fruit aromas lead to a cidery, fairly thin palate of melony flavors. Finishes plump but slightly pickled. Not bad for $7.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Opens with apple and buttercup aromas that are encouraging, but the palate falls off. It's wet but shows no definition or fruit. Creamy and generic in the mouth, and ultimately it doesn't go anywhere besides being plump and loaded with vanilla.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Opens with thin fruit and alcoholic burn, and while the wine is always hollow in its middle and basic, it does offer adequate plum, raspberry and peppery flavors. Toasty and bitter on the finish, with an o.k. mouthfeel.",Syrah
Argentina,"Citrus, lychee and a slight, briney, pickled quality define the nose. The palate has enough acidity to ensure a proper mouthfeel, although the flavors of white grapefruit and pear are basic at best. Finishes slight, bland and mildly bitter.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"An unusual blend of Riesling, Albariño and Sauvignon Blanc that is largely neutral on the nose and then waxy, honeyed and pithy in the mouth. Along the way there's an appealing dry, melony, petrol character and some good old-fashioned tang. A breed unto itself.",White Blend
Argentina,"Starts out with nice aromas of ripe black fruits and toasty oak, however it drops down in class in the mouth, where pointed, jabby acidity causes tang and sourness. There are good berry and plum flavors to offset the tartness, but it finishes narrow and snappy. Pretty good but needs better balance and structure.",Malbec
Argentina,"On one hand you'll find bacon, rubber and smoke aromas, but on the other there's stem and murky notes that bring it down. The palate has sharp acidity and flavors of roasted red berries and pepper. For a Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend, it seems lean, stemmy and wanting.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A touch stemmy on the nose, but in the mouth it comes around. The flavors are in the plump, pithy zone (think orange rind and grapefruit peel), while the finish is zesty but also pithy. Registers as your typical full-styled Malbec rosé that is o.k. on its best day.",Rosé
Argentina,"Fairly brambly and a little sour on the bouquet, with prickly fruit aromas. The palate is just as sharp and angular, without much cushion to fall back on. Flavors of cherry and raspberry are slightly herbal and tart, while the finish is more of the same. Not as round and ripe as you'd expect for an $18 Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Monteviejo, one of the Clos de los Siete wineries, has entered the unofficial “fun Malbec” category with Festivo, which has a stemmy, slightly burnt character that is present from start to finish. Along the way there are leathery black fruit flavors, herbal qualities and a good mouthfeel. Decent wine but decidedly herbal and stemmy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Starts with jammy, dusty, simple aromas of raspberry and strawberry. The palate has both a juicy front edge but also a creamy middle that houses lactic-tasting pie cherry and strawberry flavors. Regular stuff for simple sipping, nothing more.",Malbec
Argentina,"Simple and peachy, with a mix of sweet and citric flavors. Tastes candied and tropical, with banana coming onto the finish along with orange and pineapple. A lot of fruit and flavor; just not much sophistication. A quaffer, pure and simple.",White Blend
Argentina,"Weird, green, spicy and odd smelling, with hard, green raisiny flavors and an herbal finish. Barely acceptable; not varietally sound or interesting.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A scratchy, sheering wine that pushes up against sour. The palate is almost all acid, and the flavors are underdeveloped, very tart and razor sharp. Clean but hard to deal with.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rubbery and gassy smelling, with overtones of green, herbaceous fruit. The palate is sharp and grating, with pie cherry, sour raspberry and green olive flavors. Turns herbal to excess and finishes substandard.",Malbec
Argentina,"Super floral, like lady's bath powder mixed with raspberry blossom. But that's where the pleasantries end; the palate is rubbery and hard as pavement, with gamy, cooked flavors that narrow down to a tough, tannic finish. Only 250 cases made, so it's more of an experimental wine than something commercial.",Petite Verdot
Argentina,"Blowsy and tropical, with aromatic flabbiness. The feel is acceptable and the flavors of papaya and dry white fruits bring some saucy, resiny qualities. Finishes with sappy, resiny oak notes and just enough Chardonnay character to not be disastrous.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Citric smelling, with floral notes and dampness. The palate is more thin and grating than expected, with red fruit, citrus, cherry sucking candy and graham cracker flavors. Finishes a bit edgy and candied, and overall it's generic with little personality.",Malbec
Argentina,"Candied and faux smelling, with a thin red-fruit palate that's sweet and generic. Fresh feeling due to high acidity but otherwise dull in taste and short on substance, flavor and concentration.",Malbec
Argentina,"Amid innocuous aromas of apple and green banana there's a whiff of dust on a hot radiator. The palate is wet, dilute and lacking in structure, while the flavors of pineapple and mealy apple vie with green notes akin to herbs and lettuce.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Smells like old peaches and tastes a bit like tangy tangerine and grapefruit. It's pithy, lumbering and fails to show any purpose, clarity or crispness. Too strange to recommend, but not undrinkable.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smells oxidized, as if it's dying. The palate is bland in feel and the flavors suggest fermented orange juice. Not hideous but uninspired; shows only a modicum of citrus character and pulse.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"A strange, light-bodied wine with aromas of animal cracker cookies, tangy raspberry and herbal weediness. The palate is weak in structure, with light-framed, herbal red-fruit flavors and a dash of pepper.",Merlot
Argentina,"Smells brambly, sour and muddy, and that's a fair indicator of what's to come. The palate is astringent and seemingly acidified, and the wine's core plum and berry flavors are weedy and murky. Not very appealing.",Malbec
Argentina,"Yellow in color, with oxidized aromas along with a hint of lemon and butterscotch. The palate is heavy while the flavors are bland and suggest bitterness. Does not show this grape in a very positive light.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Murky, stewy, soupy aromas deliver little to no freshness or fruit, while the palate is tannic and tastes bitter, mildly weedy and minty. Seems roasted and devoid of quality. Unclean and unimpressive.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Shows barely any color and then a hard, vapid, no-fruit bouquet. The mouthfeel is citric and the tastes range from lemon to lemon. Pithy, tart and frankly it's a barely drinkable rendition of Argentina's signature white grape.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Smells like corn stalks and also of oxidation. The palate is wet but shapeless, and the flavors are waxy and jumbled. It's yet another pass-it-by, underperforming Mendoza Chardonnay.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Warm, baked and a little cheesy, but if you get past the wine's minor faults and consider its price, it rates well. Along with heat-based aromas, there is rubber and generic dark berry, while the palate is snappy, tight and tastes of raspberry, strawberry and vanilla. A blend of Merlot, Bonarda and Sangiovese.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Sound as can be on the nose, with rubber, baked berry and pastry aromas. The palate has a very nice feel to it along with flavors of dark, rich blackberry, roasted black plum, chocolate, fig and mocha. Lush, modern and smooth, with just the right weight, kick and bite. Drink now through 2012.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Clean, cedary and dynamic, with fine black-fruit aromas on the nose. The palate has a full, layered texture that impresses, while the flavors of black cherry, blackberry and boysenberry carry toasty, dark, chocolaty accents. Savory and warm on the finish, with lots of power. A blend of 75% Malbec with 20% Tempranillo and 5% Syrah.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A smooth operator with sweet aromas of cotton candy, caramel and baked black plum. The palate is exceedingly flush yet refined, while the meaty flavor profile entails roasted berry fruit and herbs. Finishes with sweet, easy notes of caramel and toast. Drink now through 2013.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Opens with classy, focused leather, herb, spice and black-fruit aromas that are full but not aggressive. Juicy and fresh, wtih cherry, cassis, and raspberry flavors. Revs up and picks up steam on the finish, and the higher acidity level says age it, which isn't so common for Malbec. Drink now through 2016.",Malbec
Argentina,"Initial butterscotch, vanilla and baked apple aromas turn to burnt corn and flatness with time and air. The palate is zesty but has no recognizable Chardonnay traits; it's big, pithy and won't turn any heads.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Brambly, hot and rubbery fruit aromas lead to a palate of lean, herbal, strawberry flavors. Herbal and snappy on the finish, with decent structure and balance. Flavorwise it's on shaky ground.",Shiraz
Argentina,"Heavy and slightly vegetal smelling, with a flat feel and flavors of banana, pineapple and vanilla. Chunky, soft and bitter on the finish. Like tropical fruit juice; bears hardly any resemblance to textbook Chardonnay.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Tropical aromas of pineapple and banana are as good as it gets. The palate is lean, acidic and sour, with a distinct briney character. Surprisingly sour and pithy; acceptable but worse than the winery's basic Saurus Chardonnay.",Chardonnay
Argentina,Opens with slightly pickled apple and melon aromas. Next in line is an edgy palate of pickled apple and vinaigrette flavors. Very pithy and tasting of grapefruit late. Fairly heavy and aggressive for SB.,Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,Red in color and flat in terms of bubbles and mouthfeel. It smells and tastes burnt and bitter. This is an odd conconction made from Malbec that's barely acceptable.,Malbec
Argentina,"Smells a lot like fresh celery and/or asparagus, with vibrant green fruit aromas and lettuce thrown in for good measure. Juicy in the mouth, with apple, citrus and green veggie flavors. Turns more vegetal the longer it goes, but freshness and acidity keep it on a solid plane.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"A little out there on a limb, with ultra-tropical aromas and limited flavors. It starts out fine in the mouth, and then come basic citrus, sweet pineapple and melon flavors. Tastes a lot like powdered sugar on the finish, but lasting acidity manages to cut through the candied sweetness.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Basic cherry and raspberry aromas have a candied tone to them, yet the palate is zesty and tart, with linear raspberry flavors that are crisp and finish like a red-fruit sucking candy. A lot of acidity and not much body. Decent but stretched thin.",Merlot
Argentina,"Sweet and a little chemical smelling, with stemmy, citrusy red fruit flavors. The palate is light and narrow, with heat. Short on the finish and not what you'd call surprising, but given the $7 price tag it is not a bad wine.",Malbec-Bonarda
Argentina,"Waxy apple and peach aromas are quiet but clean, while the palate is weighty, soft, short on lifespan, and tastes of apple and underripe nectarine. Finishes with a wash of heavy citrus but not much character.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Sweet and honeyed, but flat and cloying. Candied melon and citrus flavors run heavy and chunky, and the finish is more of the same. Big, ripe, sticky and sweet but definitely not elevated in class.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Having tasted this wine for three vintages, we are not big fans. This version is stemmy and mildly sharp, with tight, tannic red plum, raspberry and cranberry flavors. Oaky and mildly bitter late. Skims the surface but that's it.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Tropical and mild smelling, with vague aromas of melon and lychee. The palate is very sweet and sticky, as if some residual sugar had been left in the wine. Cloying late, and while it hints at higher quality, it comes across candied.",Torrontés
Argentina,"The funky stable welcomes a new breed of llama: Pinot Grigio. And like most of the other FL wines, it's acceptable to o.k. but not showing much in the way of quality. The nose is mealy and flat, while the palate has roundness and soft flavors of orange, grapefruit and white pepper.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Reduction, iodine and matchstick aromas cloud up the bouquet, while the heavy palate is both sweet and sour. In the grand scheme of things, this wine just isn't very good. It smells and tastes nothing like quality Chardonnay.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Leafy and dull to start, with questionable freshness to the aromatics. More hard and tannic than you'd want, and herbal and tomatoey in the mouth. It even has a distinct salty, no-sugar finish. Where's the freshness?",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"In general we are big fans of Toso's value-priced reds, but not so much this sweet, pickled, soft rosé. Wet and wide, but with no spine. Already on a downward plane.",Malbec
Argentina,"Crusty, inky and minty smelling, with additional earth, leaves and alcohol. A hard, rubbery, pruney style of wine that is tough and unexpressive. Think rough Montepulciano from Italy.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Toasty oak aromas hint at something serious, but in the mouth it's a dud. Banana and resin flavors are all you get, and the mouthfeel is flat as a board. Overoaked and dull.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Aggressive lemon-lime aromas are itchy, and the nose turns grassy and green. Overactive in the mouth, and tough to hold on the palate. Just at the level of acceptable; warning signs have been posted.",Sparkling Blend
Argentina,"Candied, jammy aromas don't lead to much of anything. Grating, sour, weak stuff; tomato and bland plum flavors with sour acidity. Barely worth a splash.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Very impressive for a blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot. Starts with a rich, bacony nose that brings cassis and blackberry, while the palate is saturated, big and layered, with wild raspberry, chocolate and spice flavors. It touches all the bases while maintaining a rich, almost syrupy mouthfeel. Drink now through 2014.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Excellent value in top-flight Malbec. In the four years that we've rated this wine, it hasn't dropped below 90 points. This vintage, with its deep, smooth luscious nose and dark black fruit flavors mixed with spice and chocolate, is the best Piedra Negra to date. A pure, delicious Malbec to drink now and over the next four years.",Malbec
Argentina,"A purple monster with lovely aromatics of campfire, mint, blackberry and spice. Very deep in the mouth, but not overweight or even slightly out of balance. The flavors are robust and pure, with an emphasis on black fruit, cassis and chocolate. And the finish brings nuances of cardamom, nutmeg and peppercorn. By far Goulart's epic wine. Drink now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sometimes price is not indicative of a wine's overall quality, and this appears to be a case in point. The nose is dry, cheesy and overly oaked, and the palate is downright screeching with acidity, so much so that there's a sour flavor and scour to both the palate and finish. Too much tartaric acid? You bet!",Malbec
Argentina,"Like many of this winery's bottlings, this is heavy and raisiny. However, amid all the thickness and extract there are lusty, robust roasted black fruit flavors and candied darkness. Baked on the finish, which feels hollow and doesn't last long.",Syrah
Argentina,"Piercing leather, berry and foresty aromas lead to a zesty palate of medicinal cherry and raspberry flavors. The acidity here is high, and so there's some tartness and scour to the palate and finish. Tastes pretty good but rides rough and bumpy.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Adequate on the nose, with staid berry aromas. The palate is narrow and tart, with cherry flavors and edgy heat. And the finish doesn't really change the scene much. Too snappy and short on personality; a step down from previous vintages.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Primary honey and lychee aromas fall off and dull with air, while the palate is melony and soft, with bland nectarine and peach flavors. Dry, short on flavor and weakening with each passing day. Wait for the 2009.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Tropical on the nose, with floral, lychee aromas that seem more like Torrontés than typical Sauvignon Blanc. In the mouth, the feel is basic, with sweet flavors of lychee, mango and melon. Vacuous on the finish, but overall it's not going to turn anyone off.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"This yellowish SB from Argentina's northern Salta region is a strange bird that has never caught our fancy. This vintage shows melon, peach, lychee and wax aromas, while the palate is both sweet and tart, with a fresh-for-now feel that doesn't inspire confidence that it will last for long. Flat on the finish, and unsusual overall.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Oily and funky on the nose, with a custardy, eggy undercurrent. The palate is oily and dull, while the flavors are of bitter citrus, pith and banana. In two words: not great.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"This wine is herbal and burns on the nose, where aromas of horseradish and tomato sauce don't really work. Flavors of raisin, brandy and black cherry are hardened by fierce tannins and a chemical-like dryness. Rubs like sandpaper on the palate.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Nothing much sublime about Sublimis. The nose is reedy and sweet, with licorice and overripe raisiny aromas. The palate is big and grabby, with clamp-down tannins and hard, crusty raisiny flavors. A bruising red without elegance.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Rhubarb and vinegar on the nose are ominous signs. The wine maintains a briary, sharp personality in the mouth, where red-fruit flavors have an extra juicy feel. Fresh as a cold winter's morning, but is that really what you want from Malbec?",Malbec
Argentina,"Quite the melony wine. It's heavy on the nose and chunky in the mouth. The flavors of cantaloupe and honeydew are weighty, and while it's seemingly portly, there isn't much core to it either.",Torrontés
Argentina,"It takes a few minutes to become friends with this bruising heavyweight from Mendoza's Uco Valley. It's muscular, tough, tannic and lemony now, but time will unleash a lovable, big-time Argentine blend with rustic notes along with pure, polished berry fruit and loads of earthy spice. Better to hold until at least 2011 before uncorking.",Red Blend
Argentina,"An intense Malbec-led marauder with rubbery black fruit aromas, spice and mile-deep ripeness. Pure, modern, beefy and purple, with rich black fruit flavors and also some sweeter blueberry notes. Finishes sizable but smooth. Drinkable now but better in a year. 70% Malbec with 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cab Franc.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Aromas of pithy citrus and pineapple are decent but unrefined, while flavors of tangerine and pineapple are tropical, zesty and what they are. This is nothing more than a fresh, simple, citrusy white to sip on the patio. Anything beyond that would be stretching it.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Generic to the max, with simple white fruit and lettuce aromas. The feel is wet and juicy but nothing more, with simple green fruit flavors of melon, apple and kiwi. Bland but decent if well chilled.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Harsh and less than clear on the nose despite a lack of oak. The palate is pithy and hot, with bitter apple and apricot flavors in front of a similarly pithy finish that brings banana into the fold. Sweet and heavy on the finish, which isn't all that surprising given its 14.5% alcohol level.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Varietally correct on the nose, but weak, with lychee, tropical fruit and Fantastik cleanser aromas. The palate fails to hold form, yielding an oily, heavy feel along with lemony, mealy flavors. Pithy on the finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Hot and rubbery on the nose, and while it doesn't smell bad it doesn't persuade you to go further. The palate has size, but it's not smooth as the acids dominate. And the flavors of berry and cherry are generic and almost impossible to identify as Syrah. Forgettable wine with tartness.",Syrah
Argentina,"Stemmy and fiery on the nose, with light raspberry aromas. The palate is lightweight and acidic, while the generic palate shows cherry and plum fruit and heat. Plows on through but doesn't register more than the basics.",Malbec
Argentina,"Normally we like an alternative to the heavy, weighty style of Argentine Malbec. But this is so light, dilute and tea-like that it doesn't really cut the mustard. Tastes like watered-down raspberry syrup and finishes herbal and light.",Malbec
Argentina,"At $7 a liter the price might be right, but that's about as far as we're willing to go in praising this boxed combo of Chardonnay with 10% Torrontés. The wine has mushy aromas of corn and hay, while the apple flavors are mealy and bring back some of the baked corn from the nose. Candied on the finish and flat.",White Blend
Argentina,"Heavy and raisiny stuff, with thick but narrow black plum fruit boosted by a streak of acidity that doesn't do much besides make things fiery. Poorly balanced Cab-Malbec, even for box wine.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"Gold in color and heavy, with melony aromas and citrusy, melony flavors that end fast and veer toward bitter. Quite heavy and seemingly on the fade; there aren't many reasons to go here, chief among them the weird blend of Chardonnay and Sémillon.",Chardonnay-Semillon
Argentina,"Past its sell-by date, with mealy aromas and dull flavors of apple and banana. The feel is flat, the acidity is not there, and the finish is bland and a little bitter.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Heavy hayfield aromas are oxidized, and the flavors of almond peel, citrus pith and baked banana do nothing to impress. Not a fresh or healthy wine, if it ever was. Past its prime.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"A step down from the respectable 2007. This vintage of Elsa Torrontés is weak and candied, with a sweet, buzzy almost bubbly palate. Tastes green and soda-like, with scallion and alfalfa notes.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Off the grid and strange smelling, with jumbled aromas that are hard to describe. Exceedingly sour and lean on the palate, with a vegetal finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Blackberry, ripe plum, mineral and coconut aromas blend well together, and the palate is warm, full-bodied and deep, with ripe berry, chocolate and warmth. Mocha, vanilla and coffee flavors all carry the toasty finish to a fine crescendo. Having not rated this wine before, we find this to be a fine debut. Drink now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"Brick in color and a bit Bordeaux-like in aromas, mouthfeel and flavors. Scents of dry herbs, tobacco and leafy red fruits are interesting and cool, while the palate mixes flavors of tobacco, dry fruit, brown sugar and herbs. Finishes with mild oak and coconut. Almost Rioja and/or Bordeaux in its overall presentation.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A deep, concentrated wine with a touch of raisin and latex on the nose. The palate is deep and pure, with cola, chocolate and pure berry flavors, and the finish has great persistence and warmth. Thick, ripe and balanced, with simple deliciousness and good texture. 750 cases made; drink now through 2012.",Malbec
Argentina,"Spice and clay notes grace this earthy Cabernet-led wine that sports black cherry, berry and earth notes. The palate is forward and grabby, with rubbery tannins to go with flavors of roasted berries, plum sauce, chocolate and savory spices. A no-hiccup Cabernet (with 12% Cab Franc) with just enough ruggedness to avoid being commonplace.",Cabernet Blend
Argentina,"Talcum powder and distant green melon aromas open it up, while the palate falls flat and a touch bitter, with bland melon and lychee flavors. Seems to be fading as the pulse is weak.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Sweaty and green smelling, like a hot patch of nettles or thistles. The palate is chunky and the flavors are pickled, with a touch of apple peeking in. Heavy and strained on the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Aromas of pickled cabbage and cider are not too attractive, while the palate is surprisingly spritzy and tastes of sweet canned fruit, vanilla and oak dust. Resiny on the finish, with a hint of overripe melon, corn and butter.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Raspberry, licorice and plant stalks come together in a harsh, semiburnt way, while the palate is tough and acrid, with generic red fruit. Rough on the finish, with bitterness.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Yellow in color and smelling of iodine and mealy apple. Vegetal melon flavors carry the palate, which is dull and flat in terms of feel. Not much life or quality here; hardly seems worth it.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Red-fruit aromas mix with grass clippings on the nose, and the palate is acidic, with tart, lean red fruit flavors.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Chunky, flat and stemmy on the nose, with herbal, generic fruit aromas. The palate is o.k. but sort of scratchy, while the flavors veer toward herbal, roasted cherry and berry. Herbal and sort of sweet and heavy on the finish. Pretty much what you'd expect for a $10 Cab.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Roasted, oaky and resiny on the nose, and then the palate delivers a bolt of acidity that makes the wine feel pointy in the mouth. The flavors are herbal and resiny, with foresty black fruit at the core. Creamy and sticky on the finish, and overall it struggles to present a pure, balanced picture.",Syrah
Argentina,"A hot and fiery wine from San Juan province that mixes stewy barnyard aromas with black cherry. The palate has a syrupy, sugary feel and medicinal, creamy, baked berry flavors. Peppery on the finish, but with a medicinal aftertaste.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Chunky and generic smelling, with a nutty, oily palate that isn't purely focused or clean. The palate has some bitterness and excess weight along with fading lychee and melon flavors. Not a terrible wine for $9 but the low price doesn't erase its flaws.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Dull and dilute, but painless. The palate is chunky but with enough acids to stay lively, and the flavors of green apple, lemon and pineapple are decent enough. Tangy and slightly bitter on the finish.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Smoky and rubbery smelling, with brambly, mildly stemmy fruit aromas. The palate is plummy and red in character, with herbal raspberry on the back side. Dry, tangy and herbal on the finish; adequate at best as a whole, even at $9.",Syrah
Argentina,"Bland and chunky, with aromas of talcum powder and apple. The palate feel is a mix of spritz and heft, and the flavors of melon and peach are pithy and lean toward bitter. Dusty and heavy on the finish, an indication that it won't last long and has already seen better days.",Bordeaux-style White Blend
Argentina,"With attractive melon and other tropical aromas, this is a Torrontés that rises above the masses. It smells great and tastes like a pure blend of lychee fruit, tangerine and honeydew melon. The palate feel is smooth and round, and the finish is dry, clean and healthy. It's everything that Torrontés should be. Drink now.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Snappy, prickly, red-currant aromas fail to improve with airing. The palate is high in acidity, creating a sheer feel to the cherry and raspberry fruit that drives the flavor profile. Drying and hollow on the finish. Very regular wine, with bramble and tartness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark, crusty aromas mix with sweet coconut on the nose, while the palate seems lactic and oaky despite fairly pointed acidity. Berry and plum flavors are entirely regular, and the finish is sharp due to the aforementioned acidity. A bit leafy tasting as well.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Burnt rubber, roasted generic berry and rooty tobacco aromas define the nose, which sets up a tangy, sharp, angular palate that shows little more than tart, quick cherry and raspberry flavors. Short and light on the finish.",Merlot
Argentina,"Flat on the nose, with neutral, slightly floral aromas. The palate is zesty and tart, with midland flavors of lemon, sour apple and lime. Chalky but o.k. on the finish. A one-dimensional white with hardly any lasting potential.",Pinot Gris
Argentina,"Incredibly candied and sweet smelling, much like cotton candy or pink marshmallows. The palate has a cloying, sticky mouthfeel and flavors of raisin, milk chocolate and herbal, tart berry fruits. Creamy and carob-like on the finish. Tastes and smells affected.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Jammy and murky smelling, and lacking clarity and zap on the nose. Surprisingly, the palate is jacked up with acidity, and thus it's sharp in the mouth and strained. Flavors of red fruits are made creamy by forced oak, yielding a milk chocolate note to the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Stemmy and earthy, as it smells like a mud puddle with herbal fruit mixed in. Tastes more like bitter, rubbery cherry than anything, and it's hard and dry on the finish, with a lasting flavor of baked beans. Not the worst thing going but not very good either.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A well-made Malbec that should please almost any fan of red wine. The nose is concentrated and full of black fruit, so it delivers what you'd expect. The mouthfeel is balanced, with medium weight and easy tannins. Black-fruit tastes of all types make for a solid flavor profile, and the finish offers mocha and cleansing acidity. A rock-solid wine for beef and pastas.",Malbec
Argentina,"For a tough, cool vintage, this wine displays lush qualities and depth, bordering on jamminess. Flavors of baked plums and cassis rest on a plump, soft palate with little tannic bite. All in all, it may be a little overripe, which is why the finish is short. But as a whole this is a tasty wine, especially considering the year.",Malbec
Argentina,"Light, tropical but ultimately dilute, with chalky, drying, tart flavors that run toward lemon and underripe pineapple. Lemony on the finish and monotone.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Not bad on the nose, where you get some tropicality, buttercup and flower blossom. But once you get onto the palate things go south. The acidity is high, creating tangy, lemony flavors, and all totaled there's not much here besides generic citrus and water.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Aromas of applesauce, lemon cake and lychee are probably the best part of the wine. In the mouth, it's chunky and wan, with candied, sweet apple and melon flavors. Finishes heavy, and overall it seems to be on an early fade.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Maybe this wine is already past its prime, but given that we aren't that familiar gauging barrel-aged blends of Sauvignon Vert, Pinot Gris, Chard and Torrontés, all we can say is that it comes across odd, resiny and heavy. Barrel notes and mustard flavors aren't all that great, and overall it's chunky, soft and tastes strange.",White Blend
Argentina,"Dusty, flat and cidery on the nose, and then heavy and clunky in the mouth, with flat, bland mildly bitter citrus and apple flavors. Finishes broad and pithy, and maybe a bit oxidized as well.",Pinot Gris
Argentina,"Much of what's wrong with Argentinean Chard is on full display here. The nose is stalky, hot and oily, with little freshness of fruit. And the mouth is hot and grating, with stemmy, bitter apple and citrus flavors. Tolerable on a good day, but is this really what the consumer wants?",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Vanilla and a dusty hollowness define the nose, and then comes an extremely sweet and sugary palate that almost makes your teeth and jaws hurt. Very sweet and unctuous, and thus it's to be avoided if dry whites are all you drink.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Consistently a very good Cabernet, with big, broad roasted aromas backing solid black fruit. The palate is rich, rugged and powerful, with mildly baked plum and blackberry flavors. Oak and vanilla show up on the finish, which is round and the slightest bit herbal. Drink now through 2012.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Warm dark fruit aromas of blueberry are accented by rubber and earth. The palate is deep and racy, with no dead weight and good flavors of berry, cassis, spice and chocolate. Bright in feel, focused and just oaky and dry enough to not be jammy and soft. 35,000 cases made.",Malbec
Argentina,"Generic at best, with lemon and pool water aromas that aren't about to stir many smiles. The palate is flat almost to the point of mushy, with dull lychee and green apple flavors.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Green, grassy and not very appealing. There's a can't-miss murky, green, herbal character here that yields almost weedy fruit flavors and carob. Sweet, candied, green and just not that good for a Paul Hobbs-made wine.",Merlot
Argentina,"Off the grid in terms of aromas, which hint at blueberry and candy but don't seem right or familiar. The palate is grainy and jammy, with raisiny flavors as well as souring acidity. Herbal and then bland on the short finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Wines like this are why Argentina would be best served sticking to reds. This has no bouquet to speak of, and the palate is dilute, tangy, citrusy and sharp. Acceptable but that's it.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Yellow and chunky, and definitely on the way toward the grave. Mustardy aromas are severely short on freshness, and the palate is just as flat, dull and mealy as the nose. A weird, low-acid blend of Chardonnay, Viognier and Chenin Blanc.",White Blend
Argentina,"Smells like a can of green beans, or maybe it's canned peas. Either way, the nose is a siren call of what's to come: celery, acid, lime, asparagus and canned peas. No thank you.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"If the color doesn't tell the full story, the nose will: it's impeccably perfumed, round and sweet, with amazing fruit aromas and a toasty background. The feel is as lush and rich as they come, and there's outstanding purity to the lusty black fruit flavors. A masher with elegance. Maybe the best Malbec Argentina has ever produced. Drink from 2011–15.",Malbec
Argentina,"Chunky, ripe and fruity, with bacon and roasted berry aromas. The palate has a good feel and tannins that melt away, while the flavors of black cherry and cassis lean toward medicinal but don't fully go there. Bold like Malbec should be, with hints of rubber and latex on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Another fine wine from this unheralded producer. Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot weave a nice picture based on sweet raisin, coconut and chocolate aromas. The palate is tannic but generous, with flavors of prune, blackberry, chocolate and tobacco. Chubby, rich and ripe, with intensity and darkness throughout.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Rubbery raspberry and cassis aromas give it a red fruited nose, while the palate is driving, fresh and full of raspberry, plum and sweet spice. More snappy, edgy and fresh than heavy and rich, with crispness and commendable balance.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tight and rubbery at first, but with time it settles to show jammy wild-berry aromas and density. The palate has bounce and life to spare, while the flavors are bright, fruity and full. A serious Malbec with a bit of hit and scratch to the finish. Drink now into 2012.",Malbec
Argentina,"Floral and fruity on the nose, with a strong bouquet of cassis, blackberry and ink. The palate has depth and power but also good feel, and the flavors of blackberry and dark plum are pure and accented by cocoa and cola. Toasty, dark and long on the finish.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Stately, stunning Malbec with alluring aromas of balsam wood, flower petals, cocoa and cola along with major league berry action. The palate is saturated, pure, tannic and loaded with blasting berry fruit, licorice and more. Let it age for at least another year or two (maybe more). Then let it rip with a porterhouse steak.",Malbec
Argentina,"Probably the best value in high-end Malbec from Argentina is Trapiche's single-vineyard series, which in 2006 was led by this bottling from an Uco Valley vineyard. It's lush, perfectly ripe and full of cola, black fruit and intensity. There's nary a chink in its fiber, and the rush of fruit that hits the palate followed by layers of subtleties is impressive. Great with grilled meat; drink now through 2015.",Malbec
Argentina,"From a 50+-year-old vineyard in La Consulta in the Uco Valley comes this bold, seriously built Malbec. Black cherry and coconut aromas settle in nicely, followed by forward raspberry, mocha and coffee notes. Great acidity, tannic foundation, structure and fillings; it's like a happy house. Drink from 2011 through 2015.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sweet aromas of black raisin and licorice are a good indicator of what's to come. This is one thick, jammy, softer-bodied wine that's ready to drink now. Flavors of saturated blackberry, mocha and black pepper are attractive, and the finish ends with molasses sweetness and espresso bitterness.",Syrah
Argentina,"Nice black cherry, cassis and earthy rubber aromas form a familiar, friendly type of Malbec nose, while the palate is juicy and lifted by acidity. Flavors of blackberry and chocolate are solid and under control, and the finish is mildly peppered and consistent with what comes before it. Drink now through 2011.",Malbec
Argentina,"Clean, light, tropical aromas draw you in, and there's also some tangerine and melon on the nose. The palate is fresh and pure, with honeydew, kiwi and lychee flavors. There's no excess here, and thus the dry, melony finish is just right. A correct and appealing Torrontés.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Three years ago Trapiche started making three high-end single-vineyard Malbecs; Aciar's seems a little more closed and flat than its cousins, but it does pump forward with rock-solid blackberry and cola flavors. It's better on the attack than the follow-through, but the flavors are excellent and the balance is proper even if the length is short.",Malbec
Argentina,"It's not as if this Cabernet is unique. It smells like many others, with jammy but generic red-fruit aromas that lean toward cassis and raspberry. The palate is a bit more complex than most, with herbs and black olive mixing with cassis and plum. Finishes with some lemony kick, good wood work and spice. With 10% Malbec, you can drink this wine right away.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dense and warm, with an aroma package of raisin and roasted black fruits. The wine smacks your cheeks with ripe tannins and full fruit, and the flavors of roasted berries carry some bitterness on the back end. Chewy, rich and good, with an elevated character.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A pure, sweet, easygoing, full-bodied red wine with tons of boysenberry, currant and chocolaty aromas and flavors. Dark and saturated in the mouth, with a bouncy palate, youthful but tolerable tannins, and a fudge-infused finish. Shines a positive light on varietal Bonarda.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Expensive Malbec, but there's no denying its quality and class. The bouquet is super smooth and silky, but also powerful. And that pretty much describes the palate: beautiful berry fruit rides a wave of richness that comes with accents of vanilla and pepper. Sexy, alluring wine with character.",Malbec
Argentina,"Another well-polished Malbec from Trapiche's single-vineyard series. This one, from Tupungato in the Uco Valley, is the most “red” of the '06s. The fruit is juicy and bursts with acidity and power. Cherry, red plum and cassis are the lead flavors, and it finishes on a bed of chocolate and peppery spice. Good now but will benefit from another year or two in bottle.",Malbec
Argentina,"Steady as a rock, with smoky, charred aromas mixed with beautiful black fruit scents as well as accents of licorice and earth. For anyone enthralled with New World ripeness, this is the ticket. It's a blend of 70% Malbec and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, and it is lush, packed with blackberry and boysenberry flavors, and viscous on the finish. Complete and special at every level.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Smoky and deep, with hickory and concentrated black fruit on the nose. The palate packs punch, and the flavors of blackberry, black cherry and chocolate are friendly, meaty and dark. Fairly tannic and big for a Mendoza Syrah. Not complex but seriously dark and full.",Syrah
Argentina,"There's no drop-off in this wine from the excellent 2005. Expect blackberry, cassis and dry balsam wood/cedar aromas. The palate is lush and chewy, but also vital and lively. Toasty, dark berry flavors get a softening of vanilla on the finish. A winner to drink now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"Coconut and inky black fruit melt into an ultrarich and layered bouquet, and that's the perfect entree to the wine's sweet, broad, chocolaty black fruit flavors that come with a cool mint accent. Boiled down this is nothing more than a concentrated, bold Malbec that's sweet, tasty and uncomplicated. Drink now through 2011.",Malbec
Argentina,"Among full-bodied, old-vines Malbec, this is an unbridled winner. The nose is rooty and sweet, but also inky and dark. And the palate is totally pure, with snappy tannins, fine acidity and loads of black fruit flavor mixed with tobacco and coconut. Racy, juicy and delicious as it enters its prime. Drink now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fruity and earthy, with sly, narrow flavors of blackberry and chocolate. This has the ripeness and power that one would expect from a high-end Malbec, but also a bit more finesse and natural “redness” than many heavyweights from Argentina. Hints of herbs, pine, lemon peel and mocha grace the structured finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"If an intense style of Malbec is not your thing, then keep searching because this is intense in every way. The bouquet is dark and sun-drenched, with berry jam, leather and bacon aromas. The mouth shows huge blackberry, blueberry and black olive tastes, and the finish is warm and earthy, with espresso blackness. Shows every bit of its 14.9% alcohol but can handle it.",Malbec
Argentina,"Apartado, a high-flying Bordeaux blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot, shows up only occasionally, but when it does it shines. This vintage is stunning; the black cherry and wild berry flavors are lively and honest, while the wine's structure is just where it should be. With a juicy steak or lamb chops, this wine will bowl you over.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Floral fruit aromas are neither heavy nor concentrated, but they are a touch medicinal and chocolaty. Flavors of clove, cherry, plum and oak are racy, while the finish is a bit resiny and weighted down by vanilla. Good wine for the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"A major-league oakster, with oily popcorn and baked apple aromas. The oak and vanilla are lead players on the palate as well, but along the way there's balancing acidity, length and good flavors of spiced apple, lemon curd and cinnamon. Woody and plump on the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Deep and juicy Malbec with aromas of violets, blackberry, coconut shavings and mineral. There's also a cedary element to the nose and palate. Otherwise, look for full-force wild berry and cassis flavors and a smooth, clean finish. Nothing awkward or forced; Doña Paula's best Malbec ever. Drink now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cheval des Andes brings together Cheval Blanc from St.-Emilion with Terrazas de los Andes, and for the past few years it has been the leader in Bordeaux-style wines from Argentina. The 2004 shows serious barrel notes framing classic aromas of aged gouda, saddle leather, mushroom and concentrated berries. The palate is structured, mildly tannic and layered with blackberry, cassis, raisin and licorice flavors. It's good now or will age nicely for another four to six years.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Malbec with 30% Merlot; Numina starts off with dark mineral and crude oil aromas that give way to floral scents before flavors of cherry, blackberry, chocolate and pepper. There's a lot going on and overall this attempt at a high-end, powerful red blend is successful. It's much better balanced than many of Salentein's “bigger” wines, including Primus.",Malbec-Merlot
Argentina,"Big and nice, with bacon, rubber and espresso aromas. There's a lot of color and heft to this Malbec, which belies the vintage to an extent. Look for nicely interwoven plum and berry flavors in front of a wavy, balanced finish. Pretty deep given that 2007 was an abnormally cool year in Mendoza.",Malbec
Argentina,"A standard but well-done red blend. The nose deals lively plum and blackberry aromas, but also a slight hint of pickle. It's juicy and ripe-feeling on the palate, where red-fruit flavors of plum, cherry and raspberry are dominant. Solid and warm on the finish, and healthy and honest overall. It's 75% Malbec with 15% Syrah and 10% Bonarda.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sweet blackberry and black cherry aromas are accented by mint leaf and woodspice, while the palate is slightly more narrow and snappy than you might expect, with cherry, raspberry and cough drop flavors. A little high in acidity and snap, with medicinal cherry on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Aromas of violets, blackberry and black currant jam are solid, while the palate shows sharper acidity than most Bonardas, and thus a juicy sensation along with flavors of snappy black cherry and boysenberry. Fresh and forward, with a lot of fruit and potency.",Bonarda
Argentina,"A very rich and soft wine made from hand-squeezed Malbec grapes. There's a ton of oak on it, which comes out as coconut and cream on the nose. The palate is also creamy, with mocha, sweet blackberry and fudge flavors. Cola, coconut, coffee and other hedonistic, dark, masculine accents make this a fun and interesting wine to drink now. Best on its own or with meat.",Malbec
Argentina,"Here's a full-of-dynamite, small-batch Malbec that smells of bold berry fruit mixed with earth, smoked meats and mocha. The flavor set is pure, driving blackberry with mild herbal accents, and the finish is long, flavorful and lightly herbal. Expensive and a little fiery, but still excellent. Drink now through 2013. Only 250 cases made.",Malbec
Argentina,"This mighty Malbec opens with toasty oak, a pinch of sawdust and perfumed black fruit, vanilla and spice notes. The palate is lofty and rich, with beautiful berry and plum flavors. A smooth, sexy wine from the Uco Valley that shows that vineyard sourcing absolutely matters. Best wine from Alta Vista to date.",Malbec
Argentina,"Earthy, deep and true to its Uco Valley roots; this is a very good and fairly serious Malbec that doesn't try to overstep its natural limitations. It's not too extracted or oaky but instead delivers robust blackberry, plum and caramel flavors backed by a warm, mildly oaky finish with menthol and mocha. Drink now into 2010.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big, meaty and dense, with dampness, earth and size. This is your typical deep and chewy wine, but the structure and core qualities are just above average. Flavors of black cherry, plum and brown sugar are good, while the finish shows a creamy vanilla flavor and cola. Good but not great for the price.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"NQN's Picada 15 line is a consistent source for good value among red wines. This four-grape blend (led by Cabernet Sauvignon) has a slight aroma of burnt leaves and tire rubber, but it settles with air into a good whole. Flavors of sweet berry fruits have an herbal edge, while the mouthfeel and finish are creamy, rich and smooth. Nice wine for the price.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Saturated in color almost to the point of opaque. The nose is brash, with rubbery berry, chocolate and sandalwood aromas. Intense but not overpowering, with flavors of sweet black plum, berry and black currant. Spry and lively throughout, with licorice and bitter chocolate on the finish.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Still the king of South American Pinot Noir, Chacra's “55” offers a beautiful amalgam of dusty Middle Eastern spice aromas along with raspberry, cherry and cocoa notes. It's a finessed but forceful (read: high-alcohol) Pinot with penetrating black cherry, plum and chocolate flavors, and the finish is long but hot in its youth. Doesn't lack for much of anything. Best from late 2010 through 2013.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Brilliantly colored, with dynamite concentration and lovely black fruit and earthy aromas. Precise on the palate but also big and muscular, with silky tannins, grip and a late rush of deftly applied French oak. Delicious and a fine reflection of the Uco Valley, Argentina's top Malbec region.",Malbec
Argentina,"A good value Cabernet from Argentina? You bet. This one smells like a bowl full of berries touched up with spice, vanilla and leather. It's fresh and ripe in the mouth, with flavors of blackberry jam and nutmeg. Smooth on the finish, it gets things right without pushing the envelope.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"As Argentinean rosé goes, Maipe's is a success. The wine is clean and colorful, with cheerful cherry and raspberry aromas that are decidedly not funky, skunky or stale. The palate is snappy, with mild berry fruit flavors and a clean, medium-length finish. Candied and friendly but not forced. Drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"An intense, forward style of Malbec. The nose oozes a mixture of mint, black-fruit extract and shoe polish, while the saturated palate is racy and just rich enough; the flavors of blackberry and plum are lively with coffee and mocha accents on the finish. A bit acidic and racy, but that won't hurt it if served with food.",Malbec
Argentina,"Roasted and meaty, with hints of raisin and licorice. The palate is ripe and chewy but balanced by solid tannins and fresh but natural acidity. And the flavors of blackberry, cassis and cola are true to the variety. Dense but approachable; drink now through 2009.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Malbec and Bonarda are the lead grapes in this four-variety blend that shows improvement from the 2004, which was tough. Loads of ripe, dark fruit lead the way, with chewy, dense berry flavors coming next. It's bolstered by warm, oaky hints that settle on mocha and spice, so it fits the familiar style of what is good Mendoza wine.",Red Blend
Argentina,"For several vintages running Broquel has nudged the border between very good and excellent, but as in years past the '06 is a touch tangy and racy, with black cherry, plum and berry flavors. It's bold, zippy and quite high-toned, but still it's very competent and held together.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tomero is a new line from the Carlos Pulenta group, and this one sings the tale of Salta with sincerity. You get telling acacia and lychee aromas, but none of the cheap perfume that can sometimes ruin the variety. The palate is lightly oily but linear, while the papaya, citrus and melon flavors just roll along.",Torrontés
Argentina,"The wine has a dark, crusty top to the nose, with solid berry aromas under that. The palate is bright, zesty and features familiar plum and black cherry flavors. And the finish is straightforward but smooth. Stylish, with a little snap, crackle and pop.",Malbec
Argentina,"A big, full-bodied Malbec with charm. The nose is toasty, with black fruit, chocolate and other stocky, earthy aromas. Saturated in the mouth, with concentrated black fruit flavors. Shows touches of mint and spice on the finish along with coffee, licorice and chocolate. Drink now through 2012.",Malbec
Argentina,"Inky, dark, charred and serious, and it only gets better as it opens with air. The palate has a smooth, deep, comfortable feel and the flavors are sweet, fruity, creamy and proper for Malbec. Chocolaty and rich on the finish. A very nice wine made for near-term drinking.",Malbec
Argentina,"Floral and citric, with clean, juicy aromas that conjure memories of orange blossoms and fresh lime. The palate is light and mildly citric, with melon and papaya flavors bringing a tropical edge. Ready to drink now.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Starts with a nice mix of peppery, live-fruit aromatics along with earth. Has good weight and balance, while the flavors of plum, raspberry and black cherry are mellow and touched up by hints of spice, vanilla and herbs. Shows good character and composition.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Earthy and tight on the nose, with notes of wintergreen and fresh herbs. The palate is lean and drawing, while the flavors revolve around sweet berry fruit, earth and oak. Dry, peppery and a little bitter on the finish, but spicy and real. Nice and varietally correct for Argentinean Pinot.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Dark berry and meaty fruit on the nose, with plum and blackberry aromas. The palate is zestier, with bright acidity tempering any weight. The finish is solid, with nothing off or outlandish to consider. A good, solid, concentrated Syrah without a whole lot of varietal character.",Syrah
Argentina,"More baked, muddled and heavy than Alicia's Paso de Piedra bottling, with roasted plum/berry flavors and a heavy, forceful palate that carries some burn, heat and rubber. Big and bullish, like a proverbial toro in a china shop. A lot of oak, too.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark in color, with aromas of coconut, leather, chocolate malt balls and generic black fruit. The wine is tannic and a little bit grating but generally in balance, with bold cassis, cherry and blackberry flavors. Not complex and seemingly made more for the everyday wine drinker than the collector.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Trapiche's Broquel is definitely one of Argentina's most consistent Bonardas. It opens with balsamic notes that accent chocolate and blackberry aromas, while the palate is sweet and steady as it delivers plum and ripe berry flavors. Good structure and feel, with just enough acidity to keep it in balance.",Bonarda
Argentina,"This is Torrontes in its pure, true form. Trapiche has captured the light, floral essence of the grape and wrapped it in an oily but smooth package that houses lovely green apple and papaya flavors. With structure, flavor and balance, this wine will go well with a wide range of summer foods.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Scratchy raspberry aromas lend some harshness to the bouquet, but that's replaced soon after by earthy berry fruit notes. The palate is plump and full, with chunky, thick flavors of black fruit that are nice but quiet. Fruity, jammy and easygoing throughout. Drink now into 2012.",Malbec
Argentina,"Light, inoffensive, mildly salinic and sporting melon, lychee and lime aromas and flavors. This is yet another basic, clean, generic, slightly pithy Torrontés made for immediate consumption. Smells nice, tastes good and goes down without a fuss.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Excellent Malbec at a very good price. Ripe, big, burly and a powder keg of alluring cassis, licorice and inky aromas. Rich, stout and smooth in the mouth, with generous black cherry, baked plum, coffee and chocolate flavors and finishing notes. Pure as can be; drink now through 2012.",Malbec
Argentina,"The nose offers a fine mix of floral berry, dusty earth and classic Malbec richness, while the palate is juicy, balanced and tastes of cassis, blackberry, fresh plum, cracked pepper and baking spices. Full and long on the finish, and overall it's right where you want it to be. Drink now through 2011.",Malbec
Argentina,"Calling this big-boned brew potent may be understating things. This is brawny Tupungato Malbec in full armor. Early oak-driven aromas of hard cheese and char support muscular black fruit scents, while the palate is ripe and sweet as it offers blackberry and cassis flavors. Comfortable on the palate and well balanced overall.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark and smoky on the nose, but in a good way, with asphalt and pure blackberry aromas. The wine strikes the palate with immediate grace and power. It's chocolaty yet bright, with toasty oak and vanilla stirring up the finish. A polished and poised wine with a smooth profile.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Commendations go out to this never-fail, high-end blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec. It's arguably a touch brambly and sharp at first, but give it time and any stark, tough characteristics go straight out the window. What's left is nothing but dark-fruit primary flavors, coconut and vanilla finishing notes, and lots of length. Maybe not the best Caro of all time but still a fine wine.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Quite floral and thus it smells different than the usual beefy, black-fruit-dominated Malbecs that Mendoza is known for. On the palate, it's zesty and yields cherry, raspberry and chocolate flavors. The mouthfeel is crisp and stylish, while the finish settles and doesn't seem too acidic or lean.",Malbec
Argentina,"A complete Argentinean Merlot with aromas of light oak, fresh berries and spice that all come together in harmony. The palate is a little chewy and grabby, but it tastes and feels real and full, with good tannins. For a ripe wine it isn't conflicted, over the top or challenging. Drink now through 2009.",Merlot
Argentina,"Jammy black fruit aromas are pleasant, while the palate has a feel and flow that rolls along nicely. Tastes of baked black fruits and vanilla, while the finish is solid and keeps its form. Slightly herbal if you did deep, but good overall especially when you consider the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"Yellow-ish in color, heavy on the nose, more oily than in the past, and with an aroma of cheap perfume. The wine has high acidity, a zesty bite, but not much in the middle, and thus the flavors of mango, melon and papaya are wan. Good for quaffing but not on a par with previous years.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Looks good in the glass, with dry, peppery, tomato leaf aromas along with leather and some burning brush. Has a good feel to it, with proper acidity. The flavors are snappy and peppery as they suggest pie cherry and red raspberry. Mildy spicy and toasty on the finish.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"A fine wine from Septima, most likely with Malbec at its base (though the label says nothing of the sort). Aromas of blackberry, raspberry, perfume, pepper and asphalt are attractive, and the rooty richness and slight medicinality of the core flavors are unique but not out of focus. One of the winery's best wines to date.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Blackberry, black cherry, cola and a whole lot of attractive aromas get this dense, pure Malbec going in the right direction. Lush and delicious black fruit flavors lead the palate, which also bring cola and a dusting of pepper. Lighter on the finish than the start, with olive, vanilla and mild chocolate notes.",Malbec
Argentina,"Aromas of sandalwood, violets and berries give this one an elevated, magnetic nose, while the palate is lush, big and full of black fruit and masculine tannins. A dark, minerally style from high-elevation vineyards with a coating of vanilla and caramel on the long finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"An oaky, complex wine based on Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot, The Blend shows floral notes unmatched by almost all other Mendoza/Tupungato wines. Violets and rose petals interact with earthy fruit on both the nose and palate. And unlike the masses, this wine doesn't make its point by pounding away with overextracted fruit. A different breed but well worth it. Only 40 cases made.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"With its earthy fruit and wet clay aromas, this wine shows that Argentine Cabernet is capable of aging well. Across the palate you'll find ripe, vital tannins pushing cherry, raspberry and cassis flavors, with a touch of brown sugar on the finish. Imported by Vinecrest Co.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Chunky, stout and solid on the nose, with round, pure flavors of black cherry and raspberry. The mouthfeel is comfortable and complete, especially for an $11 wine from Argentina. Finishes dry, smooth and slightly spicy; very pleasing in a no-nonsense way.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dry and lightly balsamic on the nose, with solid fruit aromas that show a marginal level of stem. The palate is stacked with black cherry and blueberry along with full tannins. The finish, however, is surprisingly silky, with chocolate and coconut flavors. A deep, nice, layered wine that has a lot going for it.",Malbec
Argentina,"A three-grape blend of Cab Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Merlot. The nose is rich and mossy, with vanilla and baked fruit aromas. It's big and tannic on the palate, and thus the sweet, semi-baked flavors of black fruit are appropriate. Sticky and tasting of brown sugar on the finish. Rich but good, especially with grilled beef.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A lot of raisin and licorice on the nose hint at overripeness, but there's also a fair amount of minty green. The palate feel is wide and chunky, but soft, with prune and baked berry flavors. Raisin, chocolate and coffee are present on the jammy finish.",Syrah
Argentina,"Sweet and properly ripe, with just a touch of medicinal mint on the nose. The palate is concentrated and clean, with solid blackberry and plum flavors. Mellow and relatively smooth on the finish. Perfectly appropriate for everyday consumption; 50% Malbec and 50% Cab Sauvignon.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Starts with baked, candied, mildly raisiny aromas that hint at expiration, but the wine has good grab and acidity on the palate along with dry fruit flavors, licorice and spice. Persistent but not special, with a light, supple finish. It's 72% Malbec with Bonarda and Syrah.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Quite creamy and sweet on the nose, with marshmallow and candy aromas that are not that convincing. Solid in the mouth, with herbal fruit, chocolate and plump tannins, body and extract. Better in terms of mouthfeel and concentration than flavor. Malbec, with Cabernet, Syrah and Petit Verdot.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Gritty, medicinal, almost reduced aromas of blueberry are devoid of softness, while the palate is also kind of tight and tough. Seems more clipped and underdone than the 2005, with narrow tannins and a medicinal burn. Has its merits and its intentions seem true, but something's not quite clicking here.",Malbec
Argentina,"Nice and pure, with controlled berry aromas, a dash of pepper and integrated background oak. A tasty, easy-to-drink wine with fine balance and fresh flavors of cherry, raspberry, cassis, chocolate and a medicinal finish. Good depth, length and size throughout. Delicious Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"With Toso's basic 2006 Malbec being named our Best Buy of the Year for 2007, we find ourselves a bit pinned in judging this higher-priced Reserve Malbec from the same year. With the microscope turned up, however, we find a well-oaked wine with pencil-shaving aromas yielding to coconut and subtle black fruit notes. The palate is dense, structured and full of cherry, cassis and clove flavors. Composed for sure, with tighter acids and tannins than the aforementioned Best Buy champ.",Malbec
Argentina,"Agile floral and white-fruit aromas give this a clean but timid outlook. The palate is fresh, lean, and racy as it pumps ample green apple and gooseberry flavors. Persistent on the finish, with a lean, easygoing personality. Nothing outrageous but perfectly good for Torrontés.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Big and strong, with full but easy black-fruit aromas. Ripeness is where it should be, as cassis and berry flavors work the consistent palate before giving way to a medium-long finish. Along the way there are hints of herbs, coffee and cherry cough drop.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Ruca Malen's wines never taste manipulated or tweaked. This Malbec-Cabernet blend has a robust, meaty nose with licorice in the rear. The palate is balanced and tastes of fresh fruits and vanilla, and overall it's healthy, pure and uncomplicated. Value-hunting fans of Argentina should keep an eye on the Yauquén label.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Strong and extracted, and needing a few minutes to settle. The palate is concentrated, dark and chewy, with ripe berry flavors that hint at being medicinal and raisiny but don't fully go there. While this is nothing earth-shattering, for $12 it's complete and should offer mass appeal.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Earthy, spicy and rich on the nose, but then quite gritty, tough and tannic on the palate. Flavors of black cherry and dark plum are thick and sweet, while the finish rests on roasted, dark berry fruit. Solid as a rock, warm, baked and sweet.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Aromas of medicinal cassis and plum show mild latex accents, but the wine is concentrated and solid on the palate, with cola, cassis and black fruit flavors. Medium bodied and fairly long on the palate, with cough drop, cassis and a pretty good feel to the finish. Equal parts Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A simple, jammy-smelling wine with cherry aromas and a whiff of citrus too. Young, vibrant, acidic and juicy on the palate, with energetic but rubbery berry and plum flavors. Good yet basic wine overall, with heat on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Regular but inviting, with good berry aromas and only a modicum of baked-fruit grit to the nose. The palate is solid and fruity, with lively, grapey berry and black-cherry flavors. Finishes smooth, with chocolate notes. Easygoing, simple Malbec from San Juan province.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fairly stemmy on the nose, with rhubarb and raspberry pushing things to the red fruit side. The palate feel is dry and basic, while the flavors of cherry and raspberry are candied and sweet. Somewhat sugary on the finish, but good for the little-known region of Catamarca.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A bright purple luster draws you in, and the nose is bright, clean, focused and full of wild blackberry. Balanced in the mouth, with size and tannin but plenty of acidity and fruit. Tastes of blackberry, vanilla cream, molasses and spice, and the finish brings it on home. Sincere and excellent for the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"Purple in color, with ripe, meaty, earthy aromas mixed with herbs, exotic berry fruit scents and vanilla. This is feisty and full-bodied Pinot with integrated plum, blueberry and well-applied oak. It's a little more citrusy and zesty than in previous vintages, and definitely a heavier style than its Cincuenta y Cinco counterpart, which will allow it to age for another four to seven years.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Light and generally neutral, this is Torrontés that's easy to quaff. The nose is mildly citric, but it doesn't go much further than that. And the palate is crisp, with peach, apple and nectarine flavors. Clean and medium on the finish; gets the job done. Drink now and drink well chilled.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Fruity and forward, but airing allows restraint and character to emerge. Still, this is a red-blooded red wine with racy fruit, plenty of freshening acids, pepper and bitter chocolate at the end. Best in late 2008 into 2009.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pungent aromas of tangerine and passionfruit get it going, so it's not shocking that the palate is zesty and citric, with flavors of passionfruit, lemon and orange. A little dilute in body, with passionfruit as the prime survivor on the finish.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Plum and dry spice aromas are solid and don't steer you wrong, while the palate has reasonably good depth and feel along with sweet berry flavors that show no variety or evolution once they get going. A little sugary on the finish, but solid as a whole.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Begins with bold mint and prune aromas, and it's also sort of foxy and sweaty. The palate is better, with saucy, tart fruit that leans toward tomato, herbs and dry berry fruit. Solid and round enough; decent with a few faults.",Syrah
Argentina,"Generic berry aromas with a hint of tomato and bramble set this off as a different breed, which it is, considering it's 78% Tannat. The palate has biting tannings and toughness, while the flavors of raspberry and strawberry are snappy. Finishes strange, with pronounced butter and foxiness. Has its positives and negatives.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Big, bulky and granular, with high alcohol and saucy, raisiny aromas. The palate and flavors find a comfortable resting spot, and the wine's baked berry and brown sugar flavors are solid if a little forced and sweet. A rich wine that needs to be drunk soon.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Sweet berry and cherry aromas are fruity and a little heavy, while the palate is solid in feel and features flavors of sweet plum and berry fruit. Chewy on the finish, with good mouthfeel. Exactly what you'd want from a wine in this price range.",Malbec
Argentina,"Snappy red fruit aromas endow this Cab with approachability, while the palate is clean, tasty and a little lean, with spicy, piquant raspberry flavors. Dry and peppery on the finish, but honest and clean throughout. Average wine; good value.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A chunky, deep-fruited Malbec that is all about blackberry fruit. There's no funk or odd, floral, overcropped aromas here; instead, it's focused on roasted blackberry flavors, a natural herbal character, and coffee and mocha on the finish. Emphasizes size and friendliness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smoky and floral on the nose, and then thick and ripe in the mouth, with syrup to go with medicinal berry flavors. It's chewy and dense, with chocolate, cream and vanilla to the finish. A bit plodding, but its full weight, feel and depth of fruit push it along.",Malbec
Argentina,"A blend of charred oak and violets lead the bouquet, which also offers some floral berry. The palate is lifted, medium-weight and juicy, with boysenberry and cherry flavors. Very nice if you like a floral Malbec with bright berry fruit as opposed to something dark, meaty and oaky.",Malbec
Argentina,"Very nice Malbec from vines with up to 80 years of age. The nose is briary, earthy and deep, with purity and power. And the palate is juicy, lively and packs enticing flavors of plum, blackberry, cured meat and vanilla. Warming, ripe stuff. Delicious and ready to drink.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lagarde regularly makes consistent, true wines and this Cab is compact, solid and smooth, with spice and a lot of berry fruit on the nose. Refined, deep and pure on the palate, with blackberry, marzipan and licorice flavors. Very nice Argentine Cabernet for the money. Drink now into 2011.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Clean and well made, but underwhelming. There's basic blueberry and blackberry flavors riding on a medium-bodied palate, but overall the wine is more generic than specific. It's easygoing and causes no red flags to go up, however at the end of the day it doesn't show much personality.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"An improvement over the dull, mulchy 2005; this wine is still a little earthy, heavy and gaseous out of the bottle but with airing it offers ripe strawberry and plum flavors with licorice and tree-bark accents. Solid, a bit tannic and slightly resiny from barrel aging; but it's also a legitimate Pinot Noir with some elevated qualities.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"The ultimate patio/terrace wine has been found, and it's Urban from O. Fournier. True as can be, with lychee, acacia and green melon aromas and flavors, this wine is plump but refreshing, with honest Cafayate character. Maybe the best under-$10 white wine being made in Argentina.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Bold blackberry and cola aromas work the nose on this bold, muscular Malbec-Syrah blend. But just when your expectations are at their highest, the palate doesn't quite meet expectations with its angular acidity and sharp-edged feel. The fruit is here, and with it the aromas and flavors. But moutfeel and balance are thin and piercing.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Aromas of baked plum, spice and bramble give it a sweet-savory opening. The palate is a touch scratchy but also endowed with tasty raspberry, plum and spice flavors. All totaled it's slightly heavy and probing, yet the burnt caramel, chocolate and dark fruit on the finish seem right for the wine.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"The bringing together of Malbec and Tempranillo works like a charm here. There's a touch of complexity to the fruit-forward nose, and better depth than what most under-$10 red varietals offer. Look for sweet, smooth raspberry and plum flavors with a tasty, balanced finish.",Malbec-Tempranillo
Argentina,"By far the best wine in the El Fogón lineup is this Torrontes. The nose is clean and harmonious, with light flower blossom scents. A citrusy mix blends with both apple and pear fruit on the palate, and the finish is clean, if a bit sweet (residual sugar?). Drink as soon as possible.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Dry and smoky on one hand, but also somewhat damp and soupy on the nose. This is a medium-to-full PN with a dark color and a mix of sweet and dry flavors as well as chunky oak and chocolate on the back palate. Creamy, sweet and showing a lot of barrel influence.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"A clean and easy style of Chardonnay with peach and melon aromas followed by a melony palate with nectarine and a touch of sweetness. It flattens out and loses intensity on the finish, but overall it's totally drinkable and solid.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Candied, tutti-frutti aromas give this a sweet, somewhat faux bouquet with little concentration. But the palate is chewy and grabby enough, with solid but modest raspberry and red plum flavors. Mellow on the finish, with a decent feel. Good but not distinguished. Malbec with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Bold, aggressive aromas of shoe polish, grainy oak, campfire and heat lead to a grabby, wide palate with sweet flavors of candied fruit and marshmallow. There's a lot of superficiality here, particular oak, but there's also legitimate Malbec fruit and character that make it worthwhile.",Malbec
Argentina,"Not bad for basic Argentine Chardonnay. The nose has banana and tropical fruit aromas to go with dried hay, while the soft-bodied palate has enough acidity to keep it flowing. Flavors of melon, banana and vanilla are solid even though it flattens out and shows mild bitterness on the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Candied cherry aromas are simple and sweet, while the young, jammy palate is clean, fresh and offers basic berry flavors. Finishes with some thickness, but overall this is the type of wine that we can recommend at $6.",Malbec
Argentina,"An elegant, better-than-most Torrontés with floral, tropical aromas sitting in front of melon, lemon and lychee flavors. The texture and weight suggest melon, and the finish has just the right level of glycerol and grab. Very nice Torrontés that manages to distinguish itself.",Torrontés
Argentina,"An extracted, full-bodied style of Malbec with blackberry aromas, density, meatiness and heft. It's thick and a bit awkward, especially early on, and then a roasted berry quality takes over. Solid as a rock, somewhat floral and young, with good kick at the end.",Malbec
Argentina,"Briary berry aromas have a modest but welcome rooty, medicinal accent, while the palate is aggressive, ripe and offers the right framework for sweet berry and plum flavors. Pure and clean on the finish, with mocha and root beer notes. High-quality Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Interesting Malbec with character and individuality. The nose is savory and smoky, with spice and floral aromas. Full and ripe in the mouth, where roasted black fruit, clove, spice and cola all make a showing. Textured and sizable late, with a coffee note to the finish. Drink now through 2011.",Malbec
Argentina,"One of Altocedro's better efforts starts with meaty, ripe, chunky black fruit aromas and a wave of mocha, cocoa and berry syrup. It's a creamy specimen but has enough acidity and vitality to not run flat. Mocha, carob and plum extend through the finish. Drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"A solid and appealing large-format wine that is 60% Malbec and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine is composed and shows honest aromas of blackberry and cassis. It's juicy and fresh in the mouth, with decent berry fruit but not much in the way of trimmings, i.e. oak, tannins, depth or length. Still, for value hunters it'll get the job done.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Bright fruit, mildly creamy, with good zest and acidity. Shows a sweet, savory center with hints of brown sugar and spice sitting along the edges. Easy tannins make it a friendly style; good for near-term drinking. No cellaring necessary.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Clean and basic, with peach, buttercup and floral aromas. The palate is round, simple, fresh and not too acidic, with melony flavors and a soft, easygoing, monotone finish. Generic but perfectly adequate Torrontés; drink now.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Good for Argentine Chard but not worth the price. It starts with mellow peach and apricot aromas, which are followed by melon, papaya and banana flavors. Easygoing in terms of feel, with a creamy, sweet finish. A typical South American tropical Chardonnay.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Dark and a little baked on the nose, with prune, fig and earthy aromas. The palate is a bit hard and reduced, with pounding tannins, but the fruit is equally big and ripe, so it all seems to be correct. Mellow on the finish, with a hint of chocolate. Good Merlot for the price.",Merlot
Argentina,"Opens with warm, woody aromas that fold in molasses and maple along with mildly baked berry fruit. The palate is alert but balanced, with proper acidity pumping up cherry, plum and snappy berry flavors. Buttery notes and toffee warm the finish, which keeps its poise.",Malbec
Argentina,"Aromas of rose hips, tomato leaf, raisin and black cherry get this fuller-bodied Pinot going on its way to a chunky palate of ripe raspberry, plum and creamy oak. There's length and a smooth mouthfeel, and it avoids common New World pot holes like faux butter or popcorn-like flavors. Drink now.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Round and saturated on the nose, with a baked, syrupy set of dark-fruit aromas. The palate is plump but offers proper acidity, and thus the flavors of cola, mocha and blackberry are round but balanced. Buttery oak comes up on the finish, and overall this is a tasty but somewhat regular high-end Malbec (with 34% Tempranillo).",Malbec-Tempranillo
Argentina,"Fairly quiet on the nose, but there's just enough varietal character to help it along. The palate is fresh and zingy, with apple and apricot flavors in front of a clean, short, simple finish. Perfectly adequate white wine but that's about as far as it goes.",Torrontés
Argentina,"There's no other way to put it: Perdriel from Norton is one of Argentina's best high-end blends. It's rich and extracted, but still carries that just-right mix of preserving acidity, structured tannins and dynamite fruit. Opens with chocolate and berry marmalade, and then effortlessly transitions to flavors of cassis, blackberry and fudge. Touches of prune, leather and coffee grace the meaty, substantive finish. 500 cases made.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Nice berry aromas feature a smidgen of spice and herbs, while the palate has forward acidity that props up lively berry flavors. Expect no frills and this big-format Merlot will satisfy. It's ripe and sweet, and overall it's done right.",Merlot
Argentina,"For two years running this Torrontes is White Pearl's most praiseworthy wine. It is true and tasty, with flowery aromas leading to flavors of lychee, papaya, melon and grass. Decent body and length give it credibility as a 1.5L Best Buy.",Torrontés
Argentina,"A nice, highly affordable bottling that highlights Argentina's value potential. The palate is soft, almost silky, with melted tannins and full flavors of raspberry and ripe plums. There's even some toasty warmth to the finish. A textbook easy rider.",Malbec
Argentina,"A good effort for the money. The nose has rubber and bold fruit, while the palate has a natural, balanced feel and nice flavors of berry, cassis, brown sugar and chocolate. Blends juiciness with enough weight and sweetness to rate highly in the value class.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Starts out with nice black cherry and cassis aromas before transitioning to roasted plum and prune flavors that come with sticky, fierce tannins and plenty of heat and grab. A very big and hard wine with midnight darkness but little subtlety. Finishes with sweet flavors of caramel and brown sugar.",Meritage
Argentina,"Slightly hard and herbal at first blush, but exhibiting more purity and depth of fruit as it opens. Flavors of sweet berries and plum are generic but welcome, and the palate is full and tannic. Overall it's pretty well stacked with fruit and power; it's also tannic and stout.",Malbec
Argentina,"Nicely aromatic, with all that's good about affordable Malbec from Argentina: bold fruit, depth and some richness. The palate is plump and stocked with tasty blackberry, plum and raisin flavors, while the finish is sturdy and subtle. A good wine that should not offend anyone.",Malbec
Argentina,"Formely known as Winemaker's Selection, this base-level Malbec is ultra purple and dark, with gritty, grapey aromas that are big but not all that well formed. The palate is heavy and tannic, with juicy, semi-green flavors of blackberry and boysenberry. Has power, color and size but not all the parts fit.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lightly citric and mildly tropical, but mostly it's just a simple, easygoing wine with cantaloupe and peachy flavors along with a mild, cleansing finish. Nothing special but nothing wrong, and therein lies its virtue.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A solid, regular, generic style of SB with white fruit aromas and apple, nectarine and pithy citrus flavors. Mildly tropical and sweet, with a finish that holds steady. Resonably good at this price.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Sharp, minty aromas mixed with stemmy red fruit set up a modest, middleweight palate of semisweet, generic red fruit flavors. Quick on the finish, with a spot of green flavor. Good enough but lacks the concentration and deeper aromas and flavors of Urban Malbec.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Foxy and jumpy smelling at first, with brambly raspberry aromas. The palate feels heavy and baked, with grabby tannins in support of herbal, mildly weedy berry fruit flavors. Finishes saucy, with a hint of tomato. Not pure and focused like the La Flor Malbec.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Starts out strong with lemon, apple and other fresh-fruit aromas. The flavors are more mealy and warm, and the palate feel is oily. Citrus, apple, lemon and tropical fruit all make appearances, but overall the wine fades into mediocrity and pithy bitterness.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Very light in color and body, with citric and chewing gum aromas along with a spot of caramel. The palate is lean, jumpy and fresh, with tart cherry and plum skin flavors. Borders on sour but doesn't quite go that far. Lean Pinot any way you slice it.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Praise before criticism, and we like the wine's stocky body, bright color and mouthfeel. In those categories, it's a high flier. But there's also a briny, pickled accent to the nose and accents of olive, rhubarb and herbaceousness. Interesting in that it differs greatly from Alta Vista's Temis.",Malbec
Argentina,"Warm, rich aromas of wild berry carry a hint of dried cheese, while the rest of the bouquet is woodsy and spicy. The palate is juicy with fresh acidity, and the flavors of red plum and raspberry are solid. A structured wine with good DNA. Drink now through 2011.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"From 83-year-old vines, this is an opaque wine with pastry/graham cracker aromas and a little bit of leather and funk. The palate has hard-hitting, cheek-slapping tannins and dense but herbal plum, blackberry and salinic flavors. It's not elegant or sleek, but it is big, thick and makes its point.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cherry, cough drop, mineral, heat and red licorice on the nose, with medicinal raspberry and plum flavors. Snappy and fresh in the mouth, with a rooty finish touched up by vanilla. Flavorful and properly executed, with a slight intrusion of cherry cough medicine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Very purple and expressive, with charred barrel aromas that border on burnt. Fortunately, the fruit below is quite healthy, but besides oozing blueberry and blackberry it's not overly defined or regal. Put this Patagonian Malbec into the category of vibrant and interesting and you won't be disappointed.",Malbec
Argentina,"Solid, sweet-styled Cab, this starts out with dark, piercing berry and asphalt aromas, which are followed by an appealing blast of dark-fruit flavors. Turns more aggressive and rugged as it opens, but stays the course.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Consistency in the wine world is a virtue, and Cheval covers the consistency issue with ease. Aromas of earth, mushroom, leather and so forth add an Old World touch to this New World Malbec-Cabernet blend. It's healthy and even juicy on the palate, with blackberry, dark plum and tobacco flavors. An interesting wine that grabs and holds your attention. Drink now through 2012.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Year by year, Salentein's top wines are improving. Primum is truly a fine wine, right up there with the country's best. It's harmonious and inviting, with cola, mineral, floral notes and honest black fruit aromas and flavors. The feel is secure and tight but also well balanced, with a touch of molasses but mostly just deep, driving black fruit. Muscular, intense and long on the finish. Drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rock solid, clean and composed. For the past several years this Malbec-Merlot-Cabernet blend has been an Argentine flag-bearer, and the '05 is as good as past vintages. Look for bold berry flavors accented by medicinal, herbal notes. And then comes a finish that's chewy and round. This is like a fat fastball in the proverbial wheel house; just see it and swing away.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Woodsy spice, clove and chocolate announce the oak that is the lead factor throughout the wine. The nose is creamy and resiny green, with vanilla yogurt, plum and berry flavors coming next. Solid in terms of acidity and feel, but a little bit lactic due to the wood treatment.",Malbec
Argentina,"Toast and char sit atop the bouquet like a heavy king on his throne, but there's nothing fake or weak about it. The color is dark and the palate is round; flavors of black plum, figs and black olives convey a meaty, true personality amid all the char, chocolate and vanilla. A good wine in the massive category that is value-priced Merlot.",Merlot
Argentina,"Floral aromas lead the show, backed by meatiness, minerality and wild sage and thyme aromas. The palate is fresh and young, with edgy but saturated plum and raspberry flavors. Turns more narrow and simple with time, but for a basic Malbec it more than gets the job done.",Malbec
Argentina,"Multifaceted on the nose, with aromas of horse saddle and mulch that give way to cleaner floral and berry liqueur scents. The palate is thick, chewy and on the softer side, while the flavors shows rich berry flavors that hint at syrup. Chewy, with a coffee-like essence to the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Black cherry and a light floral perfume get this generic Cab going in the right direction. The palate is healthy but not heavy, while the flavors of red berries and currants are tasty but anonymous to the point that it's hard to identify the wine as Cabernet Sauvignon. Still, it's smooth, fruity and easy to drink.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Basic apricot and peach aromas lead to melon, banana and pithy flavors. The palate is a little thick and mealy, while the finish has pretty good feel and length, but not much flavor. Slightly tropical and simple.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Aromas of white grapefruit, celery and other prickly fruits lose steam with airing, while the green apple and lime flavors are solid and offer some sweetness. Wet in the mouth, which is what you want, but standard fare as a whole.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Clean, straightforward aromas of berry, cassis and mineral are nice, while the palate has ample lushness, purity and focus. Flavors of cola, black currant and blackberry are solid, and the finish keeps its pose. On the money for a regular, journeyman's Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"A nice Torrontés with good muscat-like aromas along with a blast or orange blossom. The palate has weight, roundness and good, true flavors of lemon, orange and melon. Long and rock-solid on the finish, with focus throughout. Drink soon.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Fresh, inviting raspberry, strawberry and tempered vanilla aromas set up a snappy, equally fresh palate of cherry and raspberry. There's no excess heft, beef, extract or color to this wine; it's restrained but not miserly. And it finishes crisp and flashy. Well made and likely good with food.",Malbec
Argentina,"A bit heavy and granular on the nose, with oily aromas that raise question marks. Fortunately, the wine mostly tastes true, with apple-based lead flavors followed by some pithy bitterness. The finish registers as dull, yet there's still some grab to the wine. Seems to be fading.",Torrontés
Argentina,"This plump, ripe Malbec is aggressive and jumpy on the nose, but the flavors of blackberries and chocolate are pure and positively represent what Argentina can do with value-priced Malbec. If you're not expecting miracles, this thick, textured wine may just win you over.",Malbec
Argentina,"With this wine, you'll get a solid blast of oak and butter on the nose, which is backed by orange, melon and nectarine flavors. There's acidity and kick to it, but also some softer butterscotch and citrus pith notes. More than good by Argentine standards.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Apricot and oak aromas make for a smoky, slightly heavy bouquet. The wine keeps that weightiness as it passes from nectarine to citrus to tropical fruits. Long on the finish, with integrity. But it's also a bit citric in the center. “Pulpy” is another descriptor.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"With aromas of talcum powder, gardenia and lychee, this offers classic Torrontés aromas. The palate is wet, refreshing and not at all heavy, and the flavors of gooseberry, lychee and lemon are simple but nice. Good, tasty and clean, which is all you can ask for from $10 Torrontés.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Shows pretty good concentration and depth on the nose, where it only slightly hints at the herbal character that comes later. The palate is a touch astringent, with cola, blackberry and herbal flavors. Persistent on the finish, but also herbal and not overly complex.",Malbec
Argentina,"For a five-grape blend priced like this, Don Tiburcio is well worth a go. The nose is rich and jammy, much like berry marmalade. The palate is on the heavy side, with sweet flavors of raisins, prune and chocolate. Rich on the finish, with fig and black plum as well as candied accents and tannic leftovers.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Opens with bold, cuddly black fruit aromas, which are backed by a palate of driving tannins and dark berry and chocolate flavors. Not a lot of complexity or angles to ponder, but the wine's fruit content and mouthfeel are both more than good for the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"Jammy and dark, with sweet, candied, offbeat aromas. Heavy in the mouth, with baked plum and berry flavors and then a reduced, short finish. Thick almost to the point of cloying. A strange wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Granular, semitart aromas are pasty and soupy, while the palate is warm and round but tastes like sugary, artificial berry and cherry fruit. Sweet and a little chocolaty on the finish. A candied, rudimentary wine that isn't all bad.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tough, rubbery aromas include notes of carob and leather. The palate has a decent, regular feel to it along with hot flavors of baked fruits and chocolate. Finishes mildly sweet, as if it was dosed with a teaspoon of brown sugar.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Rustic and stemmy, with burnt, nutty aromas leading to a thick palate of stemmy black fruit flavors. Herbal, tannic and stemmy throughout, so at least there's continuity between the nose, palate and finish.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Lime and green melon aromas are a bit less than clean and pure, and the palate serves up a pile of jalapeño and bell pepper, with some lime in the background. Short on the finish, and kind of dilute.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Sort of nutty and oily on the nose, without a whole lot of fruit to speak of. Overoaked for what it is, with a resiny mouthfeel and finish. Too much oak, vanilla and cream for a wine of modest quality.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A baked, sweet, candied Malbec with a gritty, sugary mouthfeel and sweet, zappy cherry and plum flavors. Hot and breaks down on the finish. Rudimentary.",Malbec
Argentina,"Hot and crusty smelling at first blush and then the nose turns to mocha and smoky berry. Good mouthfeel, rich and balanced, with a fresh quality as well. Solid, complete red wine with a nice berry-packed Merlot character.",Merlot
Argentina,"Spunky dark fruit aromas open the show, with leather, cheese and mocha coming in later. The palate is a little grabby and acidic, but the juicy flavors of plum, wild berry, citrus and cassis are good. Finishes with some bounce in its step due to full acidity, and overall it maintains freshness and zest. Malbec with smaller doses of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Merlot.",Red Blend
Argentina,"The 2008 Noemía wines all seem a little sedate and short compared to prior years. This wine is dark, crusty and tarry on the nose, with requisite black fruit and a slightly soupy quality. The palate is full and chewy, with medium-intensity black fruit and chocolate flavors. Finishes short, without much velocity.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big and black, with aromas of tar, blackberry and black olive. The palate, however, is snappy and pleasantly fresh, with lively cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. Tight, balanced, competent and nice, with a smear of chocolate on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A conflicted and hence confounding wine. The nose is very oaky, but it's a pointed, almost piercing wood and clove bouquet. The wine is fierce in the mouth, with kicking tannins and acidity pushing bulldozer-like blackberry and bitter espresso flavors. With 6% Merlot, this Patagonian Malbec has its virtues but isn't as friendly as past vintages.",Malbec
Argentina,"Berry and earth on the nose are welcoming aromas, and overall this juicy, simple Malbec offers clean lines, a touch of complexity and good balance. The flavors channel berry and plum, and some vanilla runs shotgun. Not overripe or off base.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lots of heavily toasted oak sits atop the bouquet, and thus it's no surprise that the flavor profile runs a bit lemony and sharp. But give the wine time to unfold and you'll find a layer of pure blackberry mixed with notes of chocolate and coffee. Arguably too oaky but with good core qualities.",Malbec
Argentina,"Creamy peach and vanilla aromas are perfectly attractive, as is the palate. There's plenty of peach, mango and citrus pith flavors to make it worthy, and the finish is long and citrusy. Surprisingly good given the paltry price and Argentina's dearth of success with Viognier.",Viognier
Argentina,"Part of the fun of exploring Argentine Malbec is tasting all the new kids on the block. Having not seen Guentota before, all signs point to high quality. The bouquet is dark, with accents of cola, mineral and burnt toast giving it a masculine edge. Round, plump and full in the mouth, with cherry, berry and cassis flavors. A total package of a wine, with character, nuance and serious base-level fruit.",Malbec
Argentina,"A bit warm and ripe at 15.5%, but the nose of prune, raisin and blackberry is rich and only gets better with airing. The palate features tobacco and savory black fruit, and the finish runs for miles with chocolate and licorice. Despite its weight, there appears to be ample acidity to protect the wine's integrity. A blend of 75% Malbec and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Kaiken Ultra has emerged as a consistent top-shelf Malbec. This vintage shows power, purity, mineral, ripe fruit and well-applied oak. It's a generous wine with kirsch and raspberry parfait flavors. It almost makes it to creamy but by holding onto its core acidity it guards overall balance. Unforced but a little forceful; good for those who like a ripe, meaty red wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Blueberry with snap is the way to describe the bouquet on this fresh and spunky young Malbec. The flavors are sweet and intense, just like grapes off the vine. It doesn't offer much complexity but at the same time it doesn't taste confected or flawed in any way.",Malbec
Argentina,"Red berry fruit with touches of vanilla and spice give this bargain-priced Pinot a candied but inviting set of aromas. The palate runs on fresh fruit, and overall it's all about clean, forward juicy flavors and very little extra. A nice aperitif Pinot Noir.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"The wine is called 40 Barrels and every bit of those barrels is crawling on this Malbec-Cab blend. For starters, it smells more like hickory than fruit. Soon blackberry and prune aromas and flavors get into the game, but even then the back palate and finish are resiny. Some citric acidity in the center keeps it keen but raises questions about balance.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Slightly tart and like rhubarb at first, but if given some time this blend of Malbec, Merlot and Cabernet sweetens and becomes more friendly. Flavors of black cherry are bright, while the finish shows oaky vanilla, mocha and espresso notes.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Competent from the start, with well-formed fruity aromas of raspberry and plum. There's even some leather and dried cheese to the nose. In the mouth, it's all about earthy, intense berry fruit and juicy freshness. Finishes a little tart but lively, with good form and feel.",Malbec
Argentina,"Standard all the way, but isn't that what we want from a $9 wine? The nose offers raspberry and strawberry aromas, while the flavors are generic but familiar, with a lean toward cherry and berry. Solid on the finish, and fairly intense as a whole. Imported by Clock Tower Imports.",Malbec
Argentina,"Heavy, inky and seemingly a bit overripe, with grassy, doughy, cake-like aromas. The palate is simple and soft, and it comes with deep berry, candy and herbal flavors. More herbal on the finish, with coconut entering the picture.",Malbec
Argentina,"Better than in previous years but still brambly and stemmy smelling. The palate is sheer and fairly hollow in the center, with simple buttery raspberry flavors. Shows bits of burnt wood, oil and heat on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Light in color, with stalky aromas that don't feature much fruit. The palate is gentle and bland, with distant orange and tropical fruit. Wheaty and flat on the finish, with an overall canned fruit quality.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Rough and stemmy smelling, and sort of scratchy. The palate is acceptable but that's about it, with creamy, sweet, wayward berry flavors. Finishes medicinal and a bit weedy. Similar in quality to the ‘07 Urban Tempranillo.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Melony and a bit oily on the nose, with little fruit or floral character to speak of. Tastes sweet and simple, with flavors of banana and lime. Innocuous in every way.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"We have not been impressed with this Cab in recent years. This vintage is mulchy, raisiny and baked, with prune-like core flavors and a medicinal, cooked finish. Hard, tannic and not that well balanced.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Citric aromas with a note of house cleanser aren't much to rally around, The palate offers acid-based raspberry flavors and a quick finish. Not much else to say about this innocuous Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"An odd Cabernet with aromas of paprika, stewed meat and saucy fruit. At all points it's difficult to find the fruit in this wine; instead, it's dry, herbal and minty, with a lot of spice and tomato. Doesn't do much to push the cause for Argentine Cab.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Mild apple aromas and powdered sugar make up the bland nose, and the palate isn't much better. It has a creamy feel and vanilla-infused flavors of midgrade apple and pineapple. Finishes sugary and seemingly confected.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"An opening of lightly baked black fruit aromas and graham cracker is pleasant and ready, while the palate has size, a cushioned feel and herbal, spicy berry flavors and a swatch of oak on the back end. With oak and toast on the finish, it comes to a nice conclusion. Good Malbec with some pedigree.",Malbec
Argentina,"Different than most, with reduced, rubbery aromas that also bring graphite and olive into play. Very thick and syrupy in the mouth, with low acidity leading to chewy plum and blackberry flavors. Licorice and baked fruit notes control the finish, which is short and chunky. Ready to drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"A little heat early on, and also aromas of pepper, fresh fallen leaves and dry berry fruit. It's more traditional in style, meaning it isn't pitch black, sweet and thick. Instead the wine shows earthy, mature flavors of fig paste, raspberry and cough drop. More competent than flashy.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Slightly citric on the nose, with bouncy, edgy fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry. It's a lightweight with as much tea and citrus as there is beef, bulk and familiar Cabernet characteristics. More like a fruit drink than serious wine.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"After a few nice vintages of Sol Huarpe from this San Juan producer, the 2007 is sharp and weighed down by rhubarb and burnt field aromas. The palate is thin, while the flavors are mildly vegetal and soupy. Finishes crisp and citrusy. Blame it on the vintage.",Malbec
Argentina,"Reserved on the nose, with a hint of rhubarb and bramble. But where this wine really fails to impress is on the palate. It's sharp and underdeveloped, with tart cherry aromas and piercing acidity. Some mocha and vanilla come on late to help things along, but by then the wine has defined itself as borderline sour and miserly. Unusually short on fruit for Luigi Bosca, a winery we've come to like. Imported by Multiple U.S. Importers.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fairly dull and a little briary on the nose, with tart raspberry flavors and a preponderance of acidity that offers kick but not much balance. And it flat-lines on the finish after a racy beginning. Not a flawed wine but not all that good either.",Malbec
Argentina,"Waxy, round aromas are soft and properly indicate that this wine is already turning south. The palate lacks that certain Sauvignon Blanc edge but it does offer true flavors of melon, mango and orange. Full but fleshy.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Soft, ripe and chocolaty, with a raisiny quality on the bouquet. There's fading black plum and wild berry flavors; the mouthfeel is big but short on structure. Finishes with medium length and mild bitterness.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Earthy, spicy aromas soon give way to bramble, while the palate gives reasonably sweet but slightly tangy raspberry flavors. Some herbal leafiness enters on the finish, but not in an overbearing way. Good in a modest, basic way.",Malbec
Argentina,"By Belasco de Baquedano, this is a chunky, low-acid Malbec with mint, raisin and slightly damp, earthy undertones. The palate is weighty almost to the point of syrupy, while the flavors are of cola and sweet berries. Soft and slightly herbal, but good in a no-fuss sort of way.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rubbery and warm on the nose, with good berry aromas that turn flatter under the microscope. The palate shows sweet, baked berry flavors and brown sugar, while the feel is round, gritty and full of life. Nice for $8.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cola, black cherry and lemony grit mark the bouquet, which is backed by acid-driven, lightly lemony flavors of cherry and raspberry. There's isn't a ton of volume, depth or follow-through to this wine; it is what it is: fresh, tangy and straightforward.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is a straightforward, regular Cab with berry/cherry aromas and flavors. Nothing is out of the ordinary; the palate is bright and focused on simple berry flavors, while the finish has proper feel, lift and power. Shows a good mixture of fruit, acid and tannin.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A chunky wine with a full, round, sweet, tropical outlook. The nose settles on pineapple chunks, while the creamy palate features flavors of baked yellow apple and melon. Finishes upright, which is better than many. Not sophisticated but still good for Argentina.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A nice, regular sort of Malbec for everyday drinking. The nose is familiar, with basic berry aromas that have some sharpness, while the palate is solid if a bit tangy, with lively cherry flavors. Juicy and fresh, although slightly angular in feel. Ages only three months in oak, hence the fruit-forwardness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Immediately this wine hits you with a strange set of clove-dominated aromas that suggest Russian or Hungarian oak. The palate is hard, lean, grabby and tannic, with forceful clove-heavy flavors that cloud what fruit may be on offer. Finishes minty and clove-like as well.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Subpar Cabernet even when judged on the value scale. Peppery red fruit aromas are dull and cheerless, while the palate is light, acidic, herbal and burnt tasting. Almost Pinot Noir-ish in its style. Not offering much.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Baked apple is about all you draw from the flat nose, and the chunky palate is ultrasweet and tastes of corn and candy more than fruit. Cloying on the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Gaseous on the nose, with aromas of celery and lettuce leaf. The palate has a simple, bland feel and green, drying flavors of flimsy citrus. Soft overall and low on acidity.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Soupy and smells of stewed tomatoes and basil leaf. Short on fruit to the point of being weak, but surprisingly thick and syrupy in terms of mouthfeel. Herbal tasting but cloying on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Jammy strawberry aromas are alluring but light, which suggests more of an Old World style compared to most of the beefy, brawny Malbecs out there today. The palate is crisp and agile, with light-framed raspberry flavors. More elegant than hefty, but also a little hollow on the midpalate and finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"A gritty but well-made wine with aromas of crushed brick, red pepper flake, earth and sandalwood. The palate is tightly wound and mildly tannic, with semisweet flavors of black plum, fig, black cherry and chocolate. Shows a medicinal edge on the finsih, but nothing too drastic.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dark and saturated to the eye, and powerful on the nose. In the mouth, the flavors of raspberry and plum are solid, while overall the wine is full and stocky but short on complexity and uniqueness. Well executed but highly regular for an upper-shelf Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Quite the woody wine, with aromas of sawmill, cracked pepper, black licorice and dark fruit. The palate has a healthy feel to it, with integrated acidity that props up the oak-infused wild berry and herb flavors that dominate. Finishes with another wave of spicy, raw oak.",Malbec
Argentina,"Plenty of smoky oak on the nose, which leads to a mildly lactic influence on the palate. Other than that minor flaw, the wine settles to show resiny black fruit, firm tannins and a finish of vanilla and mocha. Grabby and extracted, but like so many Argentine Malbecs from 2005, it lacks the exuberant flavors and cushioned body that has made the categeory what it is today.",Malbec
Argentina,"With a hint of prune to the nose and some cheesy oak, the red flags go up. But in the mouth, the wine shows good berry and cassis flavors and admirable depth and length. Finishing notes of cassis and blackberry give it a good send-off. By no means exceptional but by all means a likable though slightly generic Cabernet.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A well-oaked wine with some modern touches. It's ripe and ready but not overdone; the flavors are of raspberry and light resin, but not much else. Like many 2005s, this Cab shows a subdued personality and less-than-expressive fruit. It's good and inoffensive, but it doesn't make you take notice.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Whereas we used to be big fans of the Crios rosado, it has fallen off over the past two vintages. This wine is weird and caustic; it smells like cracked pepper, rhubarb and cut grass, and it tastes peppery and mildly vegetal. Mouthfeel is the saving grace; it feels good and refreshing on the palate.",Malbec
Argentina,"Huge and extracted, with an opaque purple color and a massive, aggressive nose that hints at stewed fruit, sweaty leather, blackberry compote and shoe polish. Forget elegance and go straight for this wine's unbridled size and density. If that sounds unappealing, pass it by.",Syrah
Argentina,"Buttercup and lemon aromas may not be overpowering but they are true to the variety. The flavors of melon and preserved tropical fruits work on the wine's fuller-bodied, almost creamy frame. Finishes warm but peachy, with an oily texture. Drink right away.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Jammy stuff, with hints of mint, leather and cotton candy. The palate is basic, with adequate structure and nicely presented berry fruit as well as herbal accents. Sweet on the finish, with some sugary stickiness. Gets better with time in the glass.",Malbec
Argentina,"Starts with bulky fruit and bacon aromas. The palate is sort of rattled and jagged in terms of feel, while the flavors of baked berry fruit slip toward herbal. All in all, it's a pleasant, jammy, friendly, easy-to-drink, generic Cabernet.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Tannish-brown in color, with oxidized aromas. This isn't holding form and has likely already passed its sell-by date. Tastes cidery, with a grim finish. Barely palatable; wait for the 2009.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Disappointing considering the source. The nose reeks of chocolate mint, marshmallow and burnt leaves, while the palate is tannic, sour and shows only citrusy red fruit notes. One of Lurton's weakest wines to date.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Smells like crushed vitamins, iron and minerals, but no fruit. Weak, funky and sour tasting, and then angular on the finish. There's even some sauerkraut in the mix. Not what we're looking for.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Reasonably solid on the nose, with black cherry, plum and coconut aromas. The palate is another story; it's acidic and sharp, with sour plum and underdone berry flavors. Short as can be on the finish, and sour.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Severely compromised by green, minty, weedy aromas and flavors. If it weren't for the color and reasonably solid mouthfeel, this would be sunk. As is, it's not a ripe, balanced wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Nice from the get-go, with lime, citrus and fresh herb aromas. The palate is round and whole, with easygoing flavors of lemon, mango, papaya and melon. Fresh and pleasant on the finish, and perfect for aperitifs.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Mossy and quite woody, and maybe even bretty, but also rich and stout, with concentration. Aromas of cheesey black fruit are staunch, while the round palate has richness, thickness and flavors of molasses, baked berries and licorice. Finishes surprisingly quick.",Malbec
Argentina,"Recent ratings have been consistent for this pricey Malbec-Petit Verdot-Tannat blend. The nose is woody and the fruit seems baked, and along the route you encounter a cheesy, horsey quality. Thick on the palate, with good structure and buttery flavors of strawberry and raspberry. Doesn't bring it all together, but the parts have their virtues.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Less volatile than Layla's other red wines but still a stretch. Stewed cherry and plum flavors work the flat palate, while the finish is more soupy than it should be. Good compared to its siblings, but pretty weak in the grand scheme of things.",Malbec
Argentina,"Despite all the back-label talk of richness and layer-cake complexities, this wine lacks much of the sweet, yummy character that folks love about Argentine Malbec. We acknowledge that 2007 was an abnormally cool year in Mendoza, but what's here is lean, disjointed and angular.",Malbec
Argentina,"Like many wines from this vintage, Melipal seems afflicted with 2005 blues. It has black plum and some woody char to chew on, but also saline and frisky tartness. Gets better with airing and will show best with food, but it's clearly a step down from prior years.",Malbec
Argentina,"Yellowish to tan in color, this young wine is already showing signs of age, but get it early and you'll find creamy but sturdy flavors of squash, kumquat and peach. There's oak in support and plenty of personality. Whether that personality is universally appealing, however, is doubtful.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Pungent with true Sauvignon character. Tangerine, green fruits and grapefruit share the flavor profile, and the finish is mild but clean. Zesty, straightforward and tasty if served chilled.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Probably the best wine we've tasted from Santos Beck. This has a jammy, meaty nose accented by hard spices, while the palate is creamy and a touch brambly. Coffee, pepper and tannins work the finish. Drink now.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A standard wine with ample berry and plum aromas supported by blackberry, plum and chocolate flavor. It's simple but smooth, with generic berry flavors, decent mouthfeel and length. Expect only the basics and it'll rank as good everyday wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Not short on intensity but it is a little candied and gummy on the nose. It remains somewhat jammy in the mouth, with a mild creaminess softening up edgy red berry flavors. Good but candied and basic.",Malbec
Argentina,"A little bit baked, but overall it's a good, semirich Malbec with roasted, dark fruit flavors and a backdrop of chocolate. The palate has slightly more acidity than you might expect, so it doesn't come across heavy or out of whack. Regular wine done well.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dense, soupy and a little raisiny, with an overripe quality to the nose. Jammy in the mouth, but on the palate things unwind and improve. The flavors are of ultraripe but not cooked berry fruit, while the finish hints at stewed and chocolaty. Only go here if you like full, rich, sweet red wines.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with rich, broad, semiroasted aromas of black fruit, rubber and earth. The palate is basic and mildly tannic, with black plum, baked berry and mild herbal flavors. Has a syrupy profile on one hand, but tannic bite keeps it on course. Tastes good as it gets the job done.",Malbec
Argentina,"Bright but spotty on the nose, with salinic red fruit aromas that are one part raspberry and one part pool water. The palate is in the narrow, tannic field but the flavors are good, with blackberry, bitter chocolate and generic darkness working the the palate and finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sweet aromas of berry syrup give the wine steam and weight heading into a thick, chewy palate of baked berry, candy, vanilla and buttery flavors. Syrupy and creamy, but also a bit lactic on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Textbook Malbec with a nice, modern package. Solid as you'd expect, with plum/berry aromas, a hint of cherry candy and then a drawn, mildly saucy palate of red fruit. Good mouthfeel, nothing abrasive, and competent on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Nicely put together but totally generic, as if it were sent from the central casting dept. The nose has some rubber and smoke to go with black fruit, while the palate has good body and sweet black plum and berry flavors. Full enough but not baked or heavy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Strident aromas of licorice, herbs, berries and mint make it interesting, while the palate is light and fresh, with raspberry and red currant flavors. There's not a lot of heft, extract or depth to the wine, but it's likable and unhindered by excess oak and such. Enjoyable due to its unchallenging simplicity.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Round, nutty and smooth, with melon, citrus and apple flavors. In this wine's case, organic does not equal complexity. That said, what's here is clean and balanced, and there's more than enough fruit and intensity to satisfy.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Given the dearth of good Argentinean rosés on the market, this one from Cafayate (based on Malbec) is pretty tasty, balanced and interesting. The nose is succulent and not offputting, while the palate shows fresh red apple, cherry and length to the finish. Not complicated but racy and clean.",Malbec
Argentina,"Light berry aromas and a hint of spice open up this generic but solidly made Malbec-Merlot blend. Strawberry and raspberry are the lead flavors, with pepper on the finish. Not very evolved or complex, but good enough.",Malbec-Merlot
Argentina,"Purple, smoky and dense but beyond that it's regular. The palate is racy and medium deep, but the flavors are more superficial than interesting. Finishes quick, with coffee and bitter chocolate flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"Heady plum and dark berry aromas give a warning of size and ripeness, and indeed there's a ton of ripe fruit to the palate; but the wine is also raw, untamed and lacking in mouthfeel. It could stand to flow and finish better than it does.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Compared to the 2004, this wine seems less generous. The nose is solid, with licorice, spice, pepper and plum fruit. But the palate is kind of flat and bland, with plump but dull raspberry and strawberry fruit. For $30 you want more.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Quite piercing on the nose, with unyielding cherry and hard-spice aromas. The palate is also intense, with saturated black cherry and raspberry flavors riding rough on a tight frame. Not the most friendly and easy Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Citrus blossom and pine notes are welcoming enough, but the palate is sort of sweet and gummy for Torrontes. The wine has a spritzy body but not much variety in flavor. Powdery on the finish, with sugary leftovers.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Forward and lively but challenged and pithy. The apricot and melon flavors are bolstered by acidity, but the wine tastes more citric and snappy than suave. And the finish also doesn't offer much beyond citrus. Definitely not lifeless but where's the Chardonnay character?",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A little sharp and ringing on the nose, with pine and citrus keeping it ultra fresh. The palate is mildly aggressive and zesty, with herbal raspberry and cherry flavors. With light oak and acidity kicking all the way to the end, this shows the crisp side of Pinot Noir.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Supposedly Doña Paula's top selection for 2005, and while the wine shows some earthy darkness and plenty of fruit on the bouquet it doesn't follow up with the mouthfeel or overall balance that it should. It's ripe for sure, but also aggressive, with a disjointed acid-to-tannin ratio and an almost syrupy mouthfeel.",Malbec
Argentina,"Robust up front, with bacony aromas mixed with leather, violet, pickle and blackberry. The palate is crisp and racy, with a fresh, acic-driven profile that's dotted with raspberry and blackberry. Has its share of flare but also some heat and unabsorbed acidity.",Malbec
Argentina,"Inviting raspberry and cherry aromas have a tiny level of volatility, while the palate is chunky, bold and edgy, with big berry flavors leading the way. Full on the finish, with some oak and vanilla to give it padding. Lively, full-bodied Cabernet that's pretty good in the long run.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Toasty, dark aromas set up a smooth, semirich palate of creamy berry flavors mixed with spice, vanilla and pepper. This wine won't take you to wonderland but it doesn't go off course, either. Good and tasty Merlot with more than adequate balance.",Merlot
Argentina,"Neutral for the most part, but this light-framed white slips in pear, orange and spice notes while maintaining a nice, juicy profile. Nothing more than a refreshing, lime-infused dandy. But what's wrong with that?",Torrontés
Argentina,"Earthy and seemingly on the edge of being overripe, this is a wine that deals dark-fruit flavors, a milky, malty underlay, and a fairly sound mouthfeel. Ample tannins and resiny, peppery afternotes re-announce any previously detected oak, and like many wines from this vintage it's overly expressive.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Best Buy wines come in all shapes and sizes. This one settles at the bottom of the category, which doesn't mean that it doesn't have its charms, namely sweet and ready fruit and just enough acidity to keep it from being cloying. Keep in mind the price and young vintage when drinking.",Malbec
Argentina,"A little sharp and unfocused on the nose, but the palate is simple and juicy, with tangy red-fruit flavors backed by good acidity and solid tannins. Overall it's healthy and ready but sorely missing that one key ingredient: finesse.",Malbec
Argentina,"A touch creamy and milky on the nose, with shy tropical aromas in support. The palate shows warm-climate melon and peach flavors on a round, chunky frame. A mild, innocuous wine if there ever was one. Drink as soon as possible.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Powerful but reduced, with gritty berry aromas and a ton of clove on the nose. There's a carry over of the clove in the mouth, and also roasted fruit flavors, wood spice and sweetness. Powerful for sure, but arguably a bit too woody for its own good.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sweet haystack and banana aromas carry some smoke and burnt stalk, while the creamy, tropical palate shows pithy citrus fruit and sweet banana flavors. Tropical on the finish, but also slightly bitter. Solid by Mendoza standards but nothing special.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Pretty well composed on the nose, with a core of blackberry. The palate runs narrow and grabby, but the generic sweet berry fruit is tasty, albeit ultrasimple. Snappy on the finish, with the gritty feel of cherry and grape skins. Good in a basic way.",Merlot
Argentina,"Smoky and rubbery on the nose, with some green oak aromas. The palate has a soft, pasty quality to it as well as flavors of black cherry and mildly roasted berries. Finishes sort of bland and slightly herbal. Good but entirely basic in its approach.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A little flat, but the nose is adequately melony, so give it points for that. The palate is on the plump, lower-acid side, so the green fruit and lychee flavors are fleshy. Finishes solid but soft. Drink this year.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Floral, oily aromas are offset by the scents of lychee and lime. The palate is tropical and tasty, with peach, lychee and persistent freshness. It's getting a little heavy and lazy at this point in its development, but it's an honest reflection of northern Argentinean Torrontés.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Earthy, friendly berry aromas are good sbecause they don't overpower, and although the mouth is chunky and a little tannic and rubbery, the flavors are deep and ripe. Tarry and dark on the finish, with typical Bonarda weight.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Earthy, leathery aromas are front and center on the broad, beefy nose that also blends in dark fruits including blueberry. The palate is medium-bodied, with black cherry, blackberry and herbal flavors. Shows good feel and a solid, middle-of-the-road overall character.",Malbec
Argentina,"Shows peppy cherry, citrus and other short, angular aromatics, which is followed by a zesty red fruit flavor profile with a snappy mouthfeel. Dominated by cherry and raspberry, and on the finish there's mild buttery oak and carob. Good wine; distinctly tight and red fruited.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"For everyday consumption, this is good Cabernet with rousing fruit, body and pulse. The nose has smoke, rubber, pepper and cured meat to go with berry and cassis aromas, and the palate is very fruity, driving and loaded with flavorful cherry, raspberry and plum fruit. Not refined but good and honest.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Rather sweet and medicinal; the wine comes into form on the palate, which is fairly bright and forward as it pushes raspberry and cherry flavors. Acidity is on the high side, so the feel and finish have some burn. Could use some pizza or meat to help it along.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Timing is everything with this full-bodied PG. Get at it right away and it will still be almost viscous, but it should also show ripe tropical fruit flavors, core acidity and lots of personality. Just don't let it hang around for long, especially not at room temperature.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Light, floral and somewhat out of the mold. Flavors of apricot, peach and mango are both fresh and fleshy, while the finish lingers for quite some time. Fairly forceful but restrained enough.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Jumbled and jumpy on the nose, which struggles to find itself. Time gives this wine a chance to strut, and while it doesn't ever find a great groove it does offer youthful plum and berry flavors followed by resiny tannins. A little too scattered and pocked to rate better.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pleasant and fairly clean for the price, with hazelnut, honey and a dusting of talcum powder on the nose. The palate is on the thin side, and that helps the wine stay fresh and manageable. And along the way the flavors of apple, kiwi and gooseberry are relaxed and easy.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Chakana has put out many good wines in recent vintages but this rough and tumble blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Syrah  comes across minty and forced on the nose and then grating on the palate. Yes, it's got color and power. But it lacks the balance and body that you'd expect. Frankly, it seems acidified.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Big but scattered. The nose mixes incongruent aromas of green beans, chocolate and wood resin before transitioning to a palate of wood spice and generic berry fruit flavors. Too chewy, resiny and woody, and lacking harmony.",Malbec
Argentina,"Citrusy but also salinic, with mildly tart and lean lime and orange flavors. There's a touch of canned fruit character to the feel, with grapefruit on the finish. Juicy in the middle but limited.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"More chunky than some in its class, with early berry flavors but not much backing that up. The wine has a little brett and rubber, and in the end it turns lean and tight. Fresh but too sharp and thin to raise the bar.",Bonarda
Argentina,"A thick wine that doesn't bring the ripeness, sweetness and balance that's necessary. The nose is filled with milk chocolate, mint and cough syrup, while the palate is surprisingly tangy and sharp, with cranberry and wild raspberry flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"Subtle on the nose, with restrained berry, cherry and citrus peel aromas. The palate is a little grabby but mostly fresh in its approach, with flavors of fresh berry fruit. Light and mildly candied on the finish. A no-brainer that's easy as they come.",Merlot
Argentina,"Slightly oily on the nose, with a fair amount of baby powder. The palate is round and wet, but also fairly regular in its intensity and approach. Flavors of green melon run toward fat and easy, while the finish is in the same mode.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Pungent and a little pickled on the nose, with oak and cream coming on a second wave. The palate is composed, normal in feel and shows slightly choppy cherry and berry flavors. Regular but short on the finish. Good wine; nothing more than that.",Malbec
Argentina,"More floral and blueberry driven than Bousquet's regular Merlot from '07 but not discernibly better or worse. The palate is round and the balance and feel are good. Flavors of floral blueberry follow the bouquet, and the finish shows a dash of sweet berry syrup and chocolate.",Merlot
Argentina,"Slightly minty at first, with resiny oak, berry and mild leafy aromas. Things fall into line with airing, and the palate of savory, barrel-accented berry fruit is mildly herbal but solid. A little drying and leafy but pretty good overall.",Malbec
Argentina,"A lot of barrel toast and butterscotch on the nose, and also baked apple and roasted nuts. Pretty good texture, balance and acidity, with flavors of pear, banana and walnut. Long and nutty finish, with warmth and a touch of vanilla.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Roll out the barrel as far as aromas go; it's got a lot of toast and popcorn. The palate is creamy and smooth, with apple, peach and a fairly high level of sweetness. Regular on the finish, with some leftover popcorn and spiced apple.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Sweet it is, but given the price it is good wine with mass appeal. Apple, pear and mellow citrus aromas and flavors feature zero funk or mealy character, and the finish offers a dab of butterscotch. Shows mild residual sugar but many consumers will like that.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Racy cherry and red berry aromas are salinic and light, while the palate is lean and revolves around tangy, citrusy red-fruit flavors. Fresh and a little rubbery on the finish, with a tight, singular personality.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Spritzy lemon-lime aromas are attractive; there's lemon meringue and green herbs on the palate, and a narrow, fresh finish to close the deal.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Stocked with color and earthy, oaky aromas. This is not a shy wine, which doesn't make it polished or deft. Instead, it's a beefy, extracted number with midlevel dark fruit followed by plenty of forced, chocolaty oak. Big in stature with no likelihood of improving.",Shiraz
Argentina,"Far less ripe and appealing than the 2004 version. The '05 comes out of the chute smelling malty and lactic; airing reveals strawberry milk notes, while the flavors struggle to express themselves. Sticky, oily and as if someone hit the mute button along the way. Where's the ripe, lush quality we've come to love about Argentinean Malbec?",Malbec
Argentina,"Both stewy and sweet on the nose. The palate is brawny and unctuous, with big berry fruit getting gobbled up by the wine's grabby, tannic structure. This is wild, rubbery, young Cab. Air it out and serve at your barbecue.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This mildly prickly, red-fruit dominated Malbec is perfectly drinkable. The nose is drying, while the palate shows red cherries and raspberry along with some forceful buttery oak. Reasonably long on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Light green in color, with standard Torrontes aromas of acacia and tropical fruits. The palate is simple and delivers solid flavors of lychee, melon and green herbs; somewhat cloying and confected.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Some wines in this range have it and others kind of struggle. This one seems to be fighting an uphill battle. The nose is unfocused and a little mulchy, while the flavors are jammy, sweet and basic. Tannin and acidity keep it cranking, but is that good?",Malbec
Argentina,"Big and black but also heavily charred and very oaky—we're talking bulldozer oak that leaves mostly resin and vanilla on the palate. Combine that with huge tannins and extract, and what should be pleasant and fruity becomes a stampede across the palate.",Syrah
Argentina,"The Torrontes character shows on the nose, meaning there's detectable lychee and orange blossom scents. The dowside is that the palate is rather thick and honeyed but devoid of flavor. Seems to be fading into the night.",White Blend
Argentina,"Pungent, rudimentary berry aromas come across as candied, while the palate is very narrow and sweet. Drying on the finish due to wayward tannins; doesn't go beyond the ordinary. Imported by USA Wine Imports.",Malbec
Argentina,"Average red juice with sweet, rubbery aromas and flavors that match. It's Malbec in its most simple state: raspberry and cherry distilled into a quaffable liquid. Chilling might help.",Malbec
Argentina,"Aromas of chewing gum, red fruits and asphalt lead to standard berry flavors, but the feel is scouring and the finish is rough. Seems like tartartic acid is the culprit here.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A strong blast of oak comes across as resin and clove, and thus the wood doesn't augment but instead takes away from the fruit. Speaking of fruit, it's jumpy and tangy, with a finish that tastes of green olives. Overall it doesn't show proper balance or full development.",Merlot
Argentina,"Very dark and charred, but at the same time it smells like a fudge milkshake mixed with espresso. It's plump but loose in structure, with generic black-fruit flavors and strange acidic kick.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Sharp and tight on the nose, and then it stays narrow and rather punishing on the palate. It's a tangy, gritty, tough wine with tart red-fruit flavors and bitter coffee note on the finish. Malbec-Syrah-Tempranillo is the blend.",Red Blend
Argentina,Waxy aromas of scented candles and canned pears define the nose. The palate is low on acid and thus tastes soft and remotely of Bartlett pear and peach. Light on the finish; thus it needs to be drunk now.,Chardonnay
Argentina,"Lemony and stretched on the nose, with resiny oak aromas and a light hint of green. The palate has size, tannin and lots of oak, while the flavors run creamy and woody, with generic berry fruit residing under the surface. Decent for under $15, but an excess of oak creates a one-sided final product.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Like most inexpensive Malbecs, there are some strained aromas here: tire rubber, stemmy fruit and cranberry. But in the mouth it has good body and grab, with roasted fruit flavors and a touch of hickory. Savory and pretty good for under $10.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lychee, melon and peach aromas are straight from the textbook, while the palate is forceful and more acidic than many, with aggressive lemon, lime and white grapefruit flavors. Racy and citric, with a cleansing finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Winemakers Hélène Garcin and Patrice Levêque have coaxed a ton of character from 70-year-old Malbec and Cabernet vines, and the result is juicy but dark, with asphalt and tar aromas sitting in front of tight but generous black fruit (cassis and blackberry). Finishing notes of coffee, mocha and char leave you happy.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Big but flat, with soft aromas of baked plum and fall leaves. The palate is all brown sugar, caramel, chocolate and rich but hard to find black fruit, while the finish is sweet like milk chocolate and toffee. Decent wine but definitely soft and syrupy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fresh and chalky Torrontés with lemon peel and green banana aromas sitting in front of melon, mango and citrus flavors. Not overpowering or acidic, but clean and healthy. Drink right away for maximum freshness and character.",Torrontés
Argentina,"In the limited but challenged world of Argentinean Viognier, this one is pretty good. It's a touch oily and pickled, but that's a varietal trait and a reflection of warm terroir more than a fault. Flavors of citrus, pineapple and mango are solid, while the orange blossom character helps give it lift.",Viognier
Argentina,"A strange set of aromas makes for an unusual bouquet: violets, black cherry, flower-scented air freshener and blueberry are all part of the picture. The palate is superficial and not real deep, with candied, unconventional flavors of herbal berry and candy. Finishes jammy and off the grid.",Malbec
Argentina,"Typical of a Patagonian red, the profile of this Merlot is fresh, racy and snappy, Red fruit and black pepper aromas get it going, while the cherry and raspberry flavors are crisp and forward. Solid but generic red wine.",Merlot
Argentina,"Light and slightly soapy smelling, with lychee notes. The palate is full and round, with warm flavors of tangerine and lychee. Finishes with heft, smooth edges and sweetness, and overall it weighs in as a heavyweight Torrontés that might hit the mat hard when it fades.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Colorful but low in pulse, with jammy, pasty aromas sitting in front of a bulky, one-dimensional palate that offers standard blackberry fruit and mildly herbal side flavors. Has just enough acidity to keep it pumping, but as a whole it comes across a little too heavy and jammy compared to previous years.",Malbec
Argentina,"Aromas of tree bark and rooty fruit are balanced by floral notes, while the palate is angular and juicy, with acid-propelled berry and mild citrus flavors. Jumpy, fresh and tomatoey on the finish. Could use more bulk, darkness and concentration; seems sort of dilute and high-acid.",Malbec
Argentina,"A bit heavy and sweet, with big lemon-lime aromas followed by cloying pear and mango flavors. It's more creamy and sticky than desirable, but the core flavors are admirable and you can't take issue with its purity. Would be better if it were more agile.",Torrontés
Argentina,"A pretty good red for those on a budget. The nose falls into the generic but pleasant raspberry and cherry realm, while the feel and flavors are of mouthfilling, mostly clean red fruit. No real varietal character but a good enough red wine.",Shiraz
Argentina,"Juicy and jumpy on the nose, but not sour. The palate of this dark, almost red Malbec rosé is sweet and candied but also zesty due to pretty lively acids. It's not a stellar wine but it is full of berries and spunk.",Malbec
Argentina,"Licorice and prune/raisin aromas indicate slightly baked core fruit, yet the palate is clangy and ringy, with out-of-balance acids that give the wine a clumsy burn and sharpness. Along the way there are equal flavor components of cherry tomato, raspberry and red plum.",Merlot
Argentina,"Undefined black fruit aromas are average at best, while the cherry fruit is decent but citric. This wine shows too little to warrant much attention; it's brittle but persisent, with thin, cleansing acids throughout.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"So dense up front that it hints at Port. Trouble is, there's not the stuffing or fortification of Port, so what you get is full ripeness with a soft body and hard tannic walls. Finishes heavy, with a layer of melted fudge and no balancing acidity.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dark, heavy and foresty on the nose, with astringent cherry and coffee flavors. Sharp in terms of feel, with plenty of leftover acidity on the finish. Tartaric acid is all over this wine.",Red Blend
Argentina,"This wine has never been Trapiche's strong point. It's yellowish and heavy, with a forced buttery nose. Citrus steps up on the palate and dominates, and the finish is texturally scouring.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Hard-crusted, medicinal aromas give the llama more funk than we prefer, and the palate is generic and clampy. Shows a mild burnt flavor throughout and while it's okay, it doesn't taste a whole lot like the Shiraz we've grown accustomed to.",Shiraz
Argentina,"The aromas are sort of mealy and flat, and frankly the palate keeps that tune. There's pulpy white fruit and then a flat-lining finish that tastes of dried peach and melon.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Prickly pickled aromas are offset by candied fruit notes, while the palate is thin and candied, with nectarine and other less-than-berry flavors. An edgy wine that does little for the image of the obscure Bonarda grape.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Having tasted and approved of many Chakana wines in recent years, I find this one way off the charts in the wrong direction. It's charred beyond repair, with gigantic berry and black coffee flavors that simply aren't that appealing. And it gets tougher and more sticky with airing. Note to winemaker: Back off the extraction and wood treatment.",Malbec
Argentina,"Baked apple and buttercup aromas get it going in a good way, but the palate doesn't really keep the momentum. It's citrusy but low in acid, while the flavors are simple and narrow as they revolve around citrus fruits. Chunky and soft on the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Having tasted the 2002 through the 2005, the '04 seems bright by comparison, with aromatics that include forest floor, tar and lively berries. The palate, like all the Poesia wines, is mouthfilling and substantial; flavors of black cherry, boysenberry and mocha are knit together and don't skip a beat.",Red Blend
Argentina,"The youngest of the Poesia line shows some new oak in the form of sawdust aromas and espresso and mocha on the finish. In between those oak-based characteristics are mineral and black-fruit aromas as well as lush, very potent plum and berry flavors. With midnight darkness, firm tannins and straggling wood notes, we suggest sitting this bruiser down for another two to five years.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A little toasty but not too much, with apple, pear and other standard New World aromas. The palate is smooth, tropical and easygoing, with buttery, warm flavors of melon and apple. Holds it together on the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A grabby wine with earthy/mulchy aromas, licorice and prune aromas. The palate has a balsamic character to the black cherry and dark plum flavors, and the finish is more of the same. Solid enough but it doesn't vary much or improve along the way.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with red fruit aromas that are like a million other generic red wines, while the body has size, grab and stickiness. Flavors of cola, cherry, cassis and plum are red in nature and basically good, while the finish is candied but not overly so. An everyman's Cabernet in every sense of the word.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Floral, white stone fruit aromas are sweet but generally attractive, while the lively palate is oily in feel but still fresh mostly due to youth. Lemon, apple and melon are the flavor components, while the finish is sweet almost to the point of being sugary, which is a detractor. Drink right away.",Viognier
Argentina,"Creamy dark-berry aromas carry a floral, blueberry hint, while the thick palate teeters on syrupy as it delivers gummy, mildly baked black fruit flavors. Lactic and full on the finish, with a touch of crusty bitterness along with milk chocolate and/or carob.",Malbec
Argentina,"The bouquet resembles fresh apple cider. There's more apple and the addition of citrus on the palate, while the finish is ripe, fruity and soft. More chunky than upright.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Plump and soft up front, with limited aromas of honeysuckle and baked pears. The body is full and low on acids, so the flavors are chunky and the feel is cushioned. Drink now for best results; the future of this wine isn't that bright.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Certain Argentine wines have a rustic, foxy character to them that reminds us that winemaking isn't a factory-proven science. This fits the bill; it's murky and sharp on the nose, with brambly raspberry sitting in wait. Feelwise, it's a bit too piercing and choppy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Too heavy, murky and pruney on the nose; this wine has a lot of size but little freshness. It's big and bust-out, but with no direction or finesse it comes across earthy and oily. Only 250 cases made.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Decidedly brambly, with murky aromas mixed with rhubarb and pepper. The palate has a chunky, decent feel to it, but the flavors follow the nose: they are choppy and peppery. Meets all the standards of an acceptable wine, but could be much riper and more generous given its provenance.",Malbec
Argentina,"Nothing about the El Fogón wines has been impressive. This Malbec, which should be the jewel of the portfolio, is a weak pretender with starchy, lean flavors of raspberry and apple skins. It has no body and a disjointed, buttery finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pepper, green notes and burnt caramel do not create much of a bouquet, and the flavors don't go far beyond peppery fruit and green-accented raspberry and plum. An unfamiliar and afflicted rendition of Syrah.",Shiraz
Argentina,Aromas of beets and dry spice drive the harsh nose. The palate is hard and defined by bitter pepper and cherry flavors. Too much harshness and not nearly enough core fruit or cushion.,Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"Torrontes is something we've never seen from the Trumpeter line. And maybe that's good, seeing that this is oily in the mouth, with pithy, unusual flavors coming from all directions. It's a wine that doesn't stride along with ease.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Beware of funky labeled Malbecs because many don't have much to offer. Case in point, this candied, scratchy wine with wild, rampant fruit and not much else. Tastes like a jug wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Yellowish in color, a true indicator that this is on the way out. Tastes chunky and flat, with bland lychee and melon flavors. Short then bitter on   the finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Astringent almost to the point of making it tough to drink. With aromas of raspberry and citric flavors, it's a biting wine without much Cabernet size or stuffing.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Trapiche's Broquel line has never featured Pinot Noir before, and maybe this is why. Talk about a sharp, scouring wine. It's lemony and lean, with piercing cranberry flavors and razor-sharp acidity. Crispness is one thing; sharp and edgy is another.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Aromas of brick dust, sweet spice, rubber and leather are good if you're not seeking saturated berry fruit, while the palate is starchy and grabby, with flavors of stewed berry, tomato, leather and earth. Raspberry is detectable on the thin finish, but so is a soupy flavor. Decent wine with some faults.",Merlot
Argentina,"A little bit funky and unsettled when you pop the screwcap, but soon it finds its floral, blueberry base. Remains superficial and sweet in the mouth, with candied flavors, vanilla and mild oak. Highly regular; could use more concentration and density.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sharp, pickled and sour smelling at first, although it does improve with airing. The palate has a good feel and proper size and roundness, yet the berry flavors are ultraherbal. Some oak and spice is detected on the finish. Unappealing on the nose; better on the palate.",Malbec
Argentina,"Aromas of black fruit carry a light oak accent, and overall this is the type of Malbec that will earn more friends than detractors. Kind of hard and tannic in the mouth, with crisp black cherry and raspberry flavors. Clean but tough mouthfeel. Needs a burger or a slice of pizza to cut the tannins.",Malbec
Argentina,"Complete but not overly exciting. The nose has Malbec's basic black fruit and spice components, while the palate is a little high in acidity and sharpness, but also shows buttery oak and blackberry fruit. Fruity but oaky, with some excess tart acidity on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opening peach and apricot aromas are basic, while the plump palate has adequate freshness and flavors of butterscotch, banana and cream. Not a lot of fruit or verve, but round and friendly. Drink right away or wait for the '09.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Young and foxy Malbec with red fruit aromas and a little bit of wet dog. There's no shortage of freshness and pop on the palate, and the cherry and raspberry flavors are nothing if not racy. Shows a tasty, sweet side but also rudimentary raw materials.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pretty good blackberry aromas with an earthy, mulchy edge. Racy and typically rubbery in the mouth, with a muscular structure and herbal red fruit flavors. Very tight and like elastic on the finish. Has its good points with limits.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Most of the Toso wines are screaming successes, but this Syrah is mostly an amalgamation of extract and lots of oak. The wine smells like blackberry syrup caked with mocha, while the flavors and feel are limited except for the barrel notes. As Syrah goes, this doesn't deliver much finesse; just weight and wood.",Syrah
Argentina,"Incongruous but with good intentions. The nose features cherry LifeSaver aromas but also hints of cheese and leather. The palate is modest and fairly acute as it delivers tangy, stretched-out plum and raspberry flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"Better at first, when it gives green aromas and a lightness of being. But the palate runs kind of heavy, and the more you taste the heavier it gets. Soon pickle and tarragon come into play, and by then you're longing for a lighter, cleaner wine.",Torrontés
Argentina,"An aromatic dose of vinegar and rhubarb tempers expectations, and on the palate there's really nothing more than juicy, anonymous fruit and a hang-around finish. Adequate but no competition for a Mediterranean dry rosé.",Malbec
Argentina,"Minty, herbal and slightly grassy on the nose, and of course there's berry fruit to boot. The palate has normal feel and balance, with regular red fruit flavors from the currant and cherry family. Lengthy on the finish, but overall it's as basic as they come.",Malbec
Argentina,"Brickish in color, and seemingly thin. Aromas of baked fruit, compost, tobacco, vanilla and burnt coffee are challenging, while the palate is earthy and tastes leafy as well as sweet. On the positive side, it's neither heavy nor overdone. On the negative side, it's thin and on the fade.",Merlot
Argentina,"A little burnt and rubbery on the nose, but with enough lemon and apple to balance things out. The palate is fleshy and soft, with banana and lemon as the lead flavors. Shows a bit of pithy bitterness late, but overall it's good if you like sweet, warm Chardonnays.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Floral but dilute, with mild red fruit scents mixed with herbal fern and juniper aromas. The palate has a good but innocuous mouthfeel, and overall it's fresh but simple, with herbal, generic red fruit and dried oregano flavors.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"From the onset this wine struts its stuff. The nose amounts to a magnetic blend of cola, spice and exotic dark fruit, while the palate is intense with driving black cherry and blackberry flavors. Yes, there's a touch of blatant oak that sits on the palate and lasts through the finish, but the bet here is that it will dissipate with a little more time in bottle. And the wine's spice and cinnamon notes are star level.",Malbec
Argentina,"This wine is much better than most in its class. The blackberry, graham cracker and exotic spice notes are particular to Bosca, while additional notes of bacon, chocolate and nutmeg add to the pleasure. For anyone looking for quintessential Argentine Malbec at a good price, we say start here.",Malbec
Argentina,"Get by the opening notes of leather, bitter root and horseradish and what lies beneath is a top-notch Malbec-Cab Sauvignon blend that shows tons of old-vines boysenberry and cassis character. It's a bit juicy and exacting on the palate, but it's also cleansing and will never be confused for fat and misguided. A true Argentine high flier, yet the newer vintages ('03, '04 and '05) are even better.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A nose highly suggestive of green olives leads to a palate defined by sharp plum and berry flavors and a salinic, grating finish. There isn't much sweetness and character, hence it's very limited.",Syrah
Argentina,"Funky, off-base floral aromas and a sweet, cotton candy flavor profile. Feels flat and sugary to the end, with a nip of bitter almond.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"A heavy, nutty Chard. Mealy citrus and peach flavors carry the palate to a flat, uninspiring finish. Ripe but not well balanced.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Brambly on the nose, with equally challenging and drying flavors of cranberry and rhubarb. There's very little to say about this stripped-down Cabernet other than that it's generally clean and not brutally offensive.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Cavas Weinert is an old-school Mendoza winery and it holds its wines longer than most, which is why this 2002 is just now a new release. Thank Weinert for the bottle age and give this wine plenty of air. What you'll get is earth, leather, complexity, depth and ample berry fruit and chocolate. Decant for best results.",Malbec
Argentina,"Chakana makes some good wines, and the pack is led by this prestige-level blend of Cab Sauvignon, Malbec and Bonarda. It's plenty racy and forward, with plum and berry flavors that ring the bell. Toward the end some oak-based vanilla enters the game to applause. A yummy, well-made wine.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A tough sell at this price. The nose is minty, green and smells of tobacco, spice and fern fronds, while the palate is tangy, clangy in feel and dry. Flavors of semisour, herbal cherry and plum are touched up by sweet oak, but overall it's rather dry and scouring.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Red in color, with neutral aromas of red apple skins. The palate is sticky and weighty, and the taste is akin to fruit punch with tangerine on the side. Tastes o.k. but is too full, chunky and heavy to be refreshing",Malbec
Argentina,"Since Aurelio Montes of Chile crossed the Andes three or four years ago to make Kaiken, the Ultra line—be it Malbec or Cabernet—has been a consistent performer. This vintage pours on the rich, extracted aromas of black fruit and cassis, and then follows that up with similar flavors. It's full-bodied but not necessarily a heavy wine, with sweetness and chocolate but not much nuance or complexity. Drink now–2009.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Chakana strikes again with this excellent value-priced Malbec. The nose hits firmly with smoke and rubber before settling on ripe black fruit notes. Then the palate holds form, with blackberry making its mark before chocolate fills the void. Great depth and purity for a wine not meant to be complicated.",Malbec
Argentina,"An improvement over the previous vintage, this blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Syrah from Cafayate is earthy and baked, with savory leather and spice aromas laid over dark berry notes. It's a ripe, rich wine with meaty plum, berry and cherry flavors. And the mouthfeel is quite good.",Red Blend
Argentina,"The nose is like a convention of all the food groups: there's bold fruit, grilled meat, cola and even some yeasty toast. The palate is juicy and hits with firm, lively blackberry and boysenberry flavors. And the finish offers continuity between the midpalate and end game. A very nice wine from a consistent winery.",Malbec
Argentina,"Full and overly chunky, but ultimately off-kilter. Too sweet and gummy.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Strangely colored, with oyster shell aromas and weird orange-influenced flavors. Not exactly sweet but not dry either, this is borderline wine made from Cabernet and Malbec. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,Angular and overcrowded with rhubarb aromas and flavors. There isn't any finesse to this wine and only a modicum of acceptable fruit and body. Tart at the core.,Syrah
Argentina,"Nothing more than cherry soda aromas to get it going. It's highly confected, with decent acidity its only saving grace.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark purple in color, but more leafy and murky than you'd expect on the nose. The palate has texture and weight, but it's also kind of dull feeling, which matches the wine's chunky, dull flavors. Decent enough, but still too herbal and challenged.",Malbec
Argentina,"Deep and jammy on the nose, and nothing if not potent. But elegance, clarity and sophistication are nowhere to be found as the wine's grapey, soupy, flat character takes over. Bitter on the finish, and throughout there's little to latch onto besides weight and heft.",Malbec
Argentina,"Two vintages of this wine are on the books, and frankly something isn't clicking. After a flat-out weak wine in 2007, this one is showing raisiny, pasty, lactic qualities and too much clumsy sweetness. It's like a cloying ball of blackberry candy accented by bacon fat.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is your quintessential New World Best Buy. The bouquet is full, slightly oaky and a touch burnt, and overall it's very nice. Same goes for the mouth, full of ripe berry and cassis flavors. It's medium to full in terms of weight and intensity, while the tannins create a chewy, masculine sensation.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This high-altitude wine shows a cool, rubbery essence but also warmth, animal notes and rusticity. It's polished to a point, but also a wild ride. The palate is lightly saucy and spicy, and the fruit isn't overly defined or welcoming. But in between the folds there's power and bite.",Malbec
Argentina,"This Rothschild-Catena blend is dark as night on the nose, with a strong blast of freshly laid pavement. The palate is a little more acidic and snappy than expected, and as the wine unfolds it offers clean and persistent red-fruit flavors but nothing extraordinary.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Smells strange, like a bowl of Smucker's raspberry jam or applesauce. The palate is creamy and dull, with flat, jammy, candied red fruit flavors that do little to excite. Finishes with a wave of sweet marshmallow and vanilla.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Salmon colored, with soapy tangerine and nectarine aromas. The palate is watery and soft, with bland citrus and berry flavors. Comes across like a wine cooler that's lost its fizz.",Malbec
Argentina,"Blackberry and cassis aromas share the bouquet with tougher, more masculine notes of earth, rubber and char. Once it opens on the palate, there's ripe raspberry, plum and a nod to the black side of the fruit spectrum. Finishes with a mild kick of tannins and the essence of coffee and pepper. A solid blend of Cabernet and Merlot from the improving Uco Valley.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
Argentina,"Sol Huarpe's top wine, Xumek, has style and saucy sass. It's not just cookie-cutter ripe and rich, but instead shows herbs, mushroom and also ample black plum and berry flavors. In general it's nice for those seeking a touch more from their Argentinean Malbec. And it hails from lesser-known San Juan and not Mendoza, which may explain its unusual characteristics.",Malbec
Argentina,"Broquel always offers a little more elegance and pedigree than most value Malbecs, and the 2005 has body, a silky feel and aromas and flavors of tobacco, baked blackberries and leather. It's a ripe, moderately tannic wine that's best for near-term drinking.",Malbec
Argentina,"This blend from the Nicasia and Adrianna vineyards is the best Malbec on the market today. There's raisin, mineral, licorice, blackberry and more. The mouth is like a Mack truck on ice skates, meaning it's both huge and elegant. And the mile-long finish of coffee, mocha and molten black fruit is awesome. Drink now through 2013.",Malbec
Argentina,"Features intoxicating pastry, blueberry, cola and coffee aromas in front of a minerally, terroir-packed palate of soft black fruit, chocolate, fine herbs and other character-aiding touches. The mouthfeel is fabulous and the finish of Swiss chocolate and integrated spice is as smooth as silk. Drink now through 2011.",Malbec
Argentina,"Catena's signature wine is Cabernet Sauvignon-based, and it's a purple haze of dense, exotic aromas that lean toward lavender, flower petals and black fruit. It's saturated and fruity to the point of no return, with impeccable structure and mouthfeel. An avalanche of flavor and style. Drink now through 2015.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"A rough, harsh nose of mustard and burnt stems does almost nothing to draw you in, while the palate is heavy and sweet, with cloying fruit flavors and weak structure. Not up to par on the global level.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Like its little brother Calvulcura, this wine is Cabernet Sauvignon mixed with Merlot. It's a big boy with stewed berries, prune and licorice on the bouquet. Below that heavy nose is a palate that's sweet and ripe, and arguably too much so. If chocolate, richness and heft are your thing, this is a winner; purists, however, may wish for more tannin, structure and nuance.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
Argentina,"Movie popcorn, baked fruits and plenty of toast and vanilla work the entry, while forward flavors of apple and pear are kicked up a notch by full acidity. And what that all means is that fruit pierces the fairly heavy oak on this wine, leaving you with a lot of the positives of New World Chardonnay. Nice in this price range.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Round, pretty and ripe; a dead knock-off for modern-style Rioja. There are sun-baked aromas but not the cooked type, with a palate that pushes dark berry flavors and chocolate. A rich, almost medicinal wine, the type that can often cost $50. And here it's $9. Weighs in at 14.6%, so it should have its fans.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"A blasting bouquet of oak and affiliated cinnamon and spice are wave one, while next up there's dark fruit and a wealth of vanilla. This is one saturated Malbec, with menthol and tannins in spades. Only medium follow-through on the finish tempers the final grade. Imported by Southern Wine Group.",Malbec
Argentina,"If you want ripe-fruit aromas and flavors along with spice, pepper and coffee accents, this well-oaked but reasonably restrained Malbec is your ticket. The flavors run closer to raspberry and strawberry than many big Malbecs, and the texture and balance are just right. This wine delivers the maximum given its price and pedigree.",Malbec
Argentina,"Noemía's signature Malbec, now in its third vintage, is one of the country's best. It starts out herbal and smoky, with a lot of dark French oak. The mouth is powerful and pure, with at least three layers of complex flavors and textures. The fruit is both subtle and loud. Simply an excellent wine of world-class character. Best in 2008–09.",Malbec
Argentina,"Not a hair is out of place on this pure and potent Malbec. The bouquet is crusty and rich, with berry and bitter chocolate aromas. The palate is chock-full of mulberry, black cherry, nutmeg and cocoa powder; the finish is smooth and rewarding. Good through 2008.",Malbec
Argentina,"Black plum, cola and chocolate define this textbook Malbec. The wine has body, heft and lots of fruit, but also some complexity and character. Flavors of black cherry, plum and cassis are layered and fairly boisterous, while the mouthfeel is firm and just slightly tannic. Just right for red meats and pastas.",Malbec
Argentina,"Initial aromas of clove and cinnamon suggest a lot of barrel action, but give it a few minutes and the wine settles on ripe black fruit, dark spice notes and richness. It's big-boned but not overly tannic, and it exhibits Shiraz's bacon and espresso character in a good way.",Syrah
Argentina,"Cola, blackberry and cassis dominate the bouquet, with cedar making a cameo. The palate shows no shortage of tannins, while the flavors yield to the usual suspects: cassis, black fruit, etc. To call it a young buck would be accurate. It's tough, robust and tannic, yet there's a lot of fruit and power to uncover.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"The nose is forceful and strong, with char and the dark-fruit aromas that Shiraz and Malbec are known for. The palate pops along, propelled by healthy acids and moderate tannins. And the finish is fairly plush before it fades away quietly. A little more depth and length and we'd really be singing this wine's praises. As is, it's a rock-solid blend.",Shiraz-Malbec
Argentina,"Root beer and tree bark aromas give this a rooty, savory, almost baked quality. But the palate is ripe and pure, with cassis, black cherry and fresh prune flavors. Finishing fudge and coffee notes amid strong but respectable tannins make this a worthy value.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This is probably the best varietal-level Chardonnay Norton has produced. It's oak-tipped, with butterscotch and spice aromas offering some character to the nose. The melon, pineapple and pear flavors are sweet, but enough acidity creeps into the game to keep things balanced. Might we even suggest some elegance appears on this full-fruited Best Buy?",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Both the Maipe Malbec and this Cabernet Sauvignon show very good purity of fruit and skillful winemaking. This wine is full of black-fruit aromas, depth and style. The palate pushes ripe plum and berry fruit along with chocolate, and the finish is chewy and correct in terms of tannins and structure.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,When this powerhouse icon red was introduced with the '97 vintage it was heavily weighted to Cabernet Sauvignon. But now Malbec accounts for 32% of the blend. The result in this excellent year is a forward wine with laser-beam acidity framing bright blueberry and cassis flavors. It has perfect structure and avoids any of the softness and heaviness that sometimes plague New World super reds. Imported by Billington Imports.,Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"Adrianna is a higher-elevation, higher-acid single-vineyard Malbec, and it's a component of the otherworldly Argentino blend. On its own, it's fresh, healthy and sturdy. The nose offers smoky, jerky, rubber and black-fruit aromas, which are backed by exotic herb, plum and boysenberry flavors. Firm, delicious and finely structured. Drink now through 2012.",Malbec
Argentina,"Full, dark and minty, with aromatic notes of coconut and ink. One look, sniff and sip tells you this is a dark, ripe wine with extract. It's fairly lush but still tannic and balanced, with black coffee and other dark flavors on the somewhat narrow palate and finish. Imported by Excelsior Wine & Spirits.",Malbec
Argentina,"At 15% alcohol and with a nose full of prune, blazing oak and simmering blackberry jam, this is not for the weak. In fact, it may not be for the strong, because while we like the wine's sun-baked, ultraripe personality, we also acknowledge that it's teetering on the brink and probably won't age for very long.",Malbec
Argentina,"Finca Las Moras is getting fancy with this proprietary blend of Malbec and Bonarda, and with good results. The wine offers earthy, heavily wooded aromas in front of generous black cherry and chocolate flavors. It's a saturated, superripe wine that may miss a beat or two along the tour but has its positives.",Red Blend
Argentina,"This global brand has a hit in Mendoza. The '06 Malbec is lively and made right, with hickory and charred steak aromas mixing nicely with the blueberry and blackberry character in the wine. It's a darn good New World red for not much cash, and it should hold up well for at least a couple of years.",Malbec
Argentina,"Basso makes good wines year in and year out. This Malbec is saturated and potent. It needs time to air out or it could be intimidating. Once open, look for cassis and blackberry flavors in front of a dessert-worthy finish. Tastes a touch hot despite only 13.5% posted alcohol.",Malbec
Argentina,"This '05 Cab, shows berry aromas and some herbal essence, followed by flavors of boysenberry, blackberry, plum and coffee. It's well-oaked and solid, with tannic bite and good texture. A serious and real wine for a good price.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A little more complexity than normal, as the nose offers dry spices like nutmeg and cinnamon. The palate deals your typical mix of cassis and black cherry, while the structure is defined by balanced tannins. A little weak in the middle and short on the finish, but at this price that's being picky.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"About five years into its existence and Colomé has found its groove in this excellent, luscious Malbec-Cabernet blend. The bouquet is exotic and savory, with classic dark-fruit aromas, spice, cocoa and more. Big on the palate, with cassis, wild berry and chocolate flavors, and the finish is big, ripe and sturdy. Good now through 2013.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Inky dark and an outstanding example of high-end Malbec. This is the finest Alta we've tried; it is ripe as can be but not raisiny. The palate is creamy and lush, but with good acidic balance. And the flavors of black fruits, chocolate and spice make it a league-leader. Drink now through 2012.",Malbec
Argentina,"The nose is dusty and inviting, with notes of spiced berries, molasses, sandalwood and artisan soap. Very saturated but well balanced, with a creamy, oily mouthfeel and sweet, generous flavors of plum, blackberry and chocolate. Mellow and delicious from start to finish, and a winner even at this high price.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Unus is 70% Malbec and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, but what you need to know is that it's 100% excellent. The nose features a rich blend of tobacco, baked plum and leather, while the palate is saturated, concentrated and tastes of cassis and blackberry. Clean, intense and complex",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"A lovely, crisp-styled Malbec (with 10% Merlot) that does the Río Negro region of Patagonia proud. A Lisa is in its inaugural vintage, and the wine boasts toast, mineral and black fruit both on the nose and in the mouth. Not exactly streamlined but tighter than most Malbecs. Drink now into 2008.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smooth and consistent Malbec from Cafayate is what Michel Torino is all about. Don David is a higher-aiming effort, and while it shows a touch of northern Argentina's herbal, sun-affected characteristics, it's also a well-balanced, formulaic Malbec that hits all the markers: good color, nice body, friendly tannins and plenty of oak.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pronounced oak is the opening blast, and amid the shy red berry and tomato leaf aromas there are hints of leather, mint and coconut. All these scents indicate that heavy wood was thrown at the wine, so while the power and goals of the wine are admirable, it's weighed down presently by a touch too much resin. Maybe that'll drift with time but that's not for sure.",Malbec
Argentina,"A good finisher, with early minty, resiny aromas giving way to broader, more typical ripe aromas and flavors. The mouthfeel is lively courtesy of vivid core acidity, while the berry and cherry flavors come across ripe and grabby. The more air you give it the better it'll perform. Imported by Slocum & Sons.",Malbec
Argentina,"Open and rewarding, with strawberry and raspberry aromas followed by ripe, clean cherry and raspberry flavors. Don't expect a ton of depth or richness, but do expect a food-friendly wine that's convincing and well made.",Merlot
Argentina,"Soft, easy and totally ripe, this easygoing blend of Cabernet and Merlot should win over most consumers because it's a friendly sort that's endowed with cola, plum and abundant richness. Opponents may find it soft and mealy, but no matter where you stand it should be drunk as soon as possible. Imported by SWG Imports.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
Argentina,"Here and there you'll find a very well-made Argentine Viognier because the country's warmth and the grape can go together. A case in point is this plump, lush specimen that sports developed lemon and orange flavors and a long, acid-propelled finish.",Viognier
Argentina,"Concha Y Toro's Argentine property seems to be getting it right with Malbec. This affordable number is dark and dense, with plum and prune on the nose and concentrated berry flavors on the palate. For a meaty, structured, fully oaked Malbec, Trivento is the call. Imported by Excelsior Wine & Spirits.",Malbec
Argentina,"If you'd like a little character, bramble and spice to your Cab, then this is where you should go. Yes, it starts out with leather, pickle barrel and a lot of bramble bush, but every time you go back to it there's more fruit, polish, complexity and style. It's interesting, ripe and a step up from your basic street-level Cabernet.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Fairly smoky at first, with background aromas of varietally appropriate game, leather and animal. The palate mixes some earthy, more nuanced flavors such tree bark, baked plum and bitter chocolate; the finish is clean, stout and medium long. A good wine with pure dark fruit flavors.",Syrah
Argentina,"One of the year's best red wine values has to be this fully ripe and totally structured Malbec made by Alberto Antonini (winemaker for Altos Las Hormigas) and Hector Durigutti. The color almost gives away its power; and if not, the aromas of marinated meat, plum and blackberry essence will. Saturated, thick and modern, but made right. Perfect with beef.",Malbec
Argentina,"Hard black fruit and notes of tire rubber and tar indicate that this is a dark, masculine wine. And while it does offer power, it's actually quite racy and balanced in the mouth. Flavorwise, expect black raspberry and some bitter cocoa. Overall, there's nothing unripe about it.",Malbec
Argentina,"Interesting Argentine Cabernet, with rooty, baked aromas that settle in and impress if given time. The palate is balanced by subtle red-fruit and earthy flavors, while the feel is stocky and grabby courtesy of strong tannins. A good wine with a lot of positives.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"After you chop your way through the black forest of char, roasted berry and coffee aromas, you'll encounter a pretty large mass of flavors that include blackberry, cola, root beer and cinnamon. It's a fairly packed and saturated wine at 14.9%, and the finish of mocha and chocolate accentuates the wine's oak elevage. Best for those who like ripeness and size. The blend is 60% Merlot and 40% Cab Sauvignon.",Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Full, serious and ripe, with leather, animal and an underside of savory oak and bacon. Typical of the house style, the wine is lush and jammy, with syrupy black-fruit flavors setting up a composed, rich finish. Best for fans of hefty, New World reds.",Malbec
Argentina,"A lot of different aromas are vying for attention; there's spearmint, potting soil, tobacco and black fruits. The palate is saturated and pretty deep for what can best be described as a “value” wine. Flavors of blackberry and dark plums are wholesome and tasty. It's nicely balanced on the whole, with medium tannins.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz
Argentina,"A cool quality runs through the dark-fruit bouquet, which has notes of leather and earth in reserve. The palate is forward and fruity, and it settles on the finish with a touch of plushness and a little chocolate flavor. Straightforward, and with some depth. This is a nice Argentine Tempranillo that happens to be organic.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Earth and leather aromas give it some personality, while violet, plum and blackberry form the base of the bouquet. The mouth is a touch rough and drying, but it houses both red and black fruit flavors along with chocolate. Lighter in weight than its Mendoza competition, but that's Patagonia in a nutshell.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
Argentina,"A classic modern wine with plenty of vanilla, almond and baked apple on the rich, nutty bouquet. Flavors of peach, toasted nuts and bread are stylish and elegant, while a beam of acidity keeps it perfectly balanced. A great little find from Argentina.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"It's not often that Bonarda makes a point, but this new one from Trapiche's Broquel label is exemplary. The bouquet pumps out mint, tobacco, black cherry and toasted oak, while the blackberry-drenched palate is pure pleasure. With a steak, this is a sure bet. And it won't break the bank.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Rock steady from opening to close. The nose is earthy and toasty, but it's the dark-fruit notes that score the major points. Zesty and full of ribald black cherry, raspberry and chocolate flavors. Finishes with another helping of fudge, and in the final analysis it fills the tank to the brim.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smoky and sultry smelling, with berry jam aromas and ample subtleties. The palate is tannic and lively, like a good, masculine youngster should be. And the flavors of raspberry and plum are vivid and smack hard against the inside of your cheeks. Could use a year, but it's drinkable now with steak.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A touch of coconut and cream accents the dark-fruited bouquet, while the palate is less overtly oaky and more emphatic with its plum and berry flavors. No doubt this is a chewy, ripe, fruit-forward style. It's not for aging nor contemplating; best to just drink it down with meats and pastas.",Malbec
Argentina,"A touch of oak on this wine leads to a kiss of vanilla and wax on the nose alongside melon and peach scents. The palate is full of zing and lemon, and underneath there's more in the way of orange marmalade. Finishes long and lemony, with some natural heat.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Dynamic aromas of honeysuckle and mint gumdrop precede intense honey, orange, tangerine and marmalade flavors. This is a thicker, more oily style of Torrontes than the commonly seen watery ones, and it makes a statement via its viscosity and power.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Chardonnay in sunny, high-altitude Cafayate will always prove challenging, but this wine gets it right. There's a lot of spicy forward oak, and thus the palate is expectedly creamy and tinged with vanilla, cinnamon and white pepper notes along with pineapple and mango fruit. The feel and body are both correct and textured. It's sweet and oaky but well made.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Touches of tree bark, nutmeg and aged cheese give the nose diversity compared to the standard blackberry and vanilla, and in the mouth the wine is full of cola, root beer and other savory flavors in addition to berry fruit. It's a bit grabby and tannic, but overall it is quite good.",Malbec
Argentina,"A good effort by Cavas Weinert. The wine is starting to mature, and along the road you get ripe berry aromas that broaden and improve with time. The plum, blackberry and red apple flavors are right, as is the tannin-to-acid balance. The only complaint is a mild chemical-paint thinner note at the base of the bouquet.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sweet plum, raisin and chocolate work the welcoming nose, and on the palate the wine is generous but easy to understand; the flavors are flush and ripe but none too complicated. Simply stated, this wine is healthy and well made.",Malbec
Argentina,"The opening of floral and plum aromas is nice, and that's followed by some earth and heft. The palate is fleshy and tannic, with deep raspberry and plum flavors. The depth on this wine is pretty good, yet it finishes sort of short.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Mildly roasted and leafy, with dry berry aromas. This is ripe and juicy on the palate, with berry, black cherry and mocha flavors. Finishes almost creamy, with honest structure and medium-range tannins. Drink now.",Merlot
Argentina,"Leather, charred oak and mineral carry the nose, which also offers some generic black-fruit aromas. The palate is firm and tannic, thus the early session of cassis and blackberry is preferable to the tail-end notes of buttery oak, tannin and burnt coffee.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Citrus, acacia blossom and patchouli oil give this an interesting and true-to-Cafayate bouquet. The palate delivers a shot of lychee fruit along with   tangerine and melon, with lemon meringue pie to finish. One of Argentina's better Torrontes; drink now.",Torrontés
Argentina,"There's a sweet center to the bouquet, but surrounding it are more complex notes of mushroom, rubber and roast meat. The palate features ripe, clean blackberry and cassis flavors, while the finish shows piercing tannins. Shows some weight and tannic build-up at this point; drink now and into '09.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Butter and dill are the first aromas to make themselves noticed, and below that there's raw oak and lighter-weight fruit notes. The palate shows ample resin and wood notes along with pepper and spice. It's a good wine with serious intent, but it seems a little overwooded and a tiny bit green. Cabernet Sauvignon leads the blend, with Merlot and Cab Franc filling it out.",Cabernet Blend
Argentina,"Big and ripe, with hefty aromas of stewed fruit, cola and mint. The palate is broad but drying, with average plum and blackberry flavors. It lacks some vitality and doesn't hit the high notes, but it's wholesome and qualifies as big-boned and ready.",Shiraz-Malbec
Argentina,"A draft of menthol and aromas of chocolate and mossy fruit work pretty nicely on the nose, while the palate is superripe, a bit candied and accented by spice and coffee. This is a strong starter, though it falls off a little on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"A little big and heavy, but that's the style that Kaiken has pushed since arriving on the market a few years ago. This version has baked-fruit aromas backed by lemon peel and espresso, while the palate is rich, dark and syrupy, but also oaky and tannic. Seems to want to offer more than it can deliver. The 14.5% alcohol level tells you that it's a big boy.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Every llama has its day, and for Funky Llama this is one to take to the bank. The olive, leather and dry oaky aromas set the stage for solid cassis, raspberry and herb flavors. The body, feel and finish seem right, so for the money it's a blue chip special.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This is Bousquet's better 2006 Malbec because it doesn't have the heavy-handed oak of the Reserva. Here you get a ton of ripe, clean fruit with secondary leather and earth aromas. The palate is lively as it hits with firm blackberry and plum flavors. Not complex but good in its simplicity. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Malbec
Argentina,"Gets going with a lot of barrel and leather, but maybe not as much fruit as one might hope for. Makes its point with a round, creamy mouthfeel that supports jammy plum and blackberry flavors. A very good Malbec that will be better once the vines age.",Malbec
Argentina,"Round, melony and driven by aromas of pears and apples, this internationally styled wine should strike a chord among casual Chardonnay quaffers. It's kind of sweet, a little bit fat, and it finishes smooth. True to the blueprint in many ways; think California and this will complete the picture. Imported by Excelsior Wine & Spirits.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"More syrupy and chunky than ideal, but still a good wine with grilled meat, root beer and berry extract on the bouquet. The body seems a little baked and heavy, with molasses and raisin flavors mixing with blackberry. Finishes with melted brown sugar and soft tannins. A full, deep wine that shows a few signs of being overripe.",Malbec
Argentina,"Much better and way more complex than your average Torrontés. The bouquet is flower power, lychee and tangerine, and overall this is an exotic, driving wine like no other from Argentina. Expect roundness and similarities to Viognier; it's amplified and impressive.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Immediately this one shines. The nose offers deep bacon, crusty mineral and hefty, perfectly ripe dark-fruit aromas. Balance is key to the wine's success, with beefy, sweet flavors of black plum offset by some fire and proper acidity. Peppery on the finish, with an overall warm, ripe, toasty personality. Ready to drink now.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Pineapple and apple aromas are fairly attractive and fresh, as is the light, wet and zippy palate, which shows mostly citrus and apple flavors. The finish is mild and clean, and overall the wine delivers clarity and a dominant citrus profile.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Big and boisterous, as if you're sniffing a bed of coal, menthol and macerated black fruit. The palate is sun-drenched and juicy, but not what you'd call elevated. And the finish mixes savory flavors with tight tannins. A good red wine that bears little semblance to Old World Syrah.",Syrah
Argentina,"The only thing holding this value-priced Cab back is that it seems slightly overripe, which results in a bouquet that's mildly cooked and grainy and a palate that's rooty and sweet. But if you like softer tannins and flavors of root beer, chocolate and spice, this has plenty of that.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Simple aromas may lack vibrancy but aren't offputting. And frankly speaking, it's nice to smell soft berry fruit and not much else (namely burnt or buttery oak). The palate, meanwhile, is plump, bright and full of clean but basic boysenberry fruit. Finishes thin but sturdy.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is a blend of Cab Sauvignon, Malbec and Merlot that's agile, fresh and offers good mouthfeel. The nose deals crushed brick, leather, spice and light red fruit, while the flavors run toward red cherry and red currants. Uncomplicated; drink now. Imported by Quintessential Wines, LLC.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A full and pulsing wine, with leather and other animal notes to make things more interesting. The mouth is like a black-fruit explosion: muscular berry and tannins fly all over the place, ending in a lively, almost fiery finish. A bit grabby and overexcited, but good with grilled meats.",Malbec
Argentina,"From San Rafael in southern Mendoza, this Cab Sauvignon picks up a little more steam and complexity every time you go back to it. The nose is your basic cassis and raspberry, while the medium-weight palate features ripe fruit finishing in a sweet cascade of milk chocolate and burnt brown sugar. Satisfying, especially if you like a hint of sweetness to your Cab.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Jammy red-fruit aromas mixed with buttery oak make for a simple, sappy nose. There's more butter on the palate in addition to solid blackberry flavors. It finishes round but short, with yet another wave of barrel. A very good wine but not one that wows.",Malbec
Argentina,"Inky black in color, with a pretty nose defined by toast, minerality, stout plum and berry fruit. Round and vigorous in the mouth, with vibrant dark-berry flavors. A muscled-up wine from Salta with just enough finesse to balance everything out. Ready to drink.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark and fiery, with grapy, heavily extracted aromas. Compared to the winery's Premium Cabernet, this is harder and more choppy, with staggering tannins and heat on the finish. It's a monster with teeth, and only time will tell if it finds a friendlier place. Hold for a couple of years.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dense and full of plum, spice, smoke and char. The palate is up to the task, offering lively, concentrated berry and black cherry flavors. A complete wine with good balance. It has a purpose and a way of getting there.",Malbec
Argentina,"Clos de los Siete, the amalgmated product of Michel Rolland's Uco Valley wine commune, is rich, round and ripe, with deep aromas and trimmings like polished oak and minerality. The wine is proper, medium to full in size, and full of blackberry, plum and cocoa. No hiccups, pure fruit and complexity make this stellar for the price.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Basso's premium blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah and Merlot is an example of good fruit meeting good winemaking. With leather and brick dust accenting black-fruit aromas, the bouquet is positive. And the flavors of plum, blackberry, soy sauce and cola are very nice. A breakout wine for this winery.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Intense, saturated and well balanced, with touches of motor oil, earth and herbs on the nose. The palate is flush and mouthfilling, with proper tannic bite, fine acidity and stylish flavors of blackberry and raspberry.",Malbec
Argentina,"One of the best $15 red blends being made today. Carrascal gives us 45% Malbec, 35% Merlot and 20% Cabernet in rock-solid form. The nose has toast, mineral, balsam wood and good berry fruit, and the palate provides the troika of cherry, raspberry and plum with no interference or oaky gimmicks. Pleasant, warm and long on the finish.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Sweet aromas that verge on syrupy set up a sweet and easy palate of black cherry and cassis. This has a nice texture as it shows good body, feel and fruit quality. Maipe means “lord of the winds” in a native language, and while this Malbec won't transport you anywhere, it's good for the price.",Malbec
Argentina,"Peppery red fruit and a strong whiff of a wet dog make this a leap of faith. The palate holds that peppery element while also showing raspberry and cassis notes. Vanilla and wood spice are front and center on the finish, and while it gets better with time, it never quite reaches fifth gear.",Malbec
Argentina,"A little bit of leather and smoke meat give the blackberry bouquet something different, while the palate is round, forward and shows good plum and berry flavors. Some heat and spice on the finish do not detract from the overall package, which makes the grade if it doesn't blow you away.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Starts with roasted coffee, berry liqueur and toast, while the palate is pretty dense and loaded with boysenberry and cherry. The feel is solid and juicy, with firm acids and tannins supporting a peppery finish. Saturated and staunch, but ordinary.",Malbec
Argentina,"Staunch cherry and grape aromas are indicative of what the wine will give. The palate pushes ahead with plum and cherry flavors, but the fruit isn't overly developed and the mouthfeel is more tight and sheer than cushioned and rich. Zesty and firm on the finish, which is par for this course.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark fruit and plenty of oak on the nose, with a creamy vanilla-based palate that's sporting plenty of new wood to match the bouquet. The barrel is front and center here, but there's also solid Cab texture and power. Imported by Excelsior Wine & Spirits.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Smoke, rubber and a touch of herbs and leaves make this more traditional in style, meaning it offers Old World Bordeaux notes of earth, mineral and subdued fruit as opposed to ripe, jammy berry notes. It's not a big, aggressive wine but it does have tannic strength and intensity. Malbec, Merlot and Cab Sauvignon make up the blend.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"In a shrinking domain (wines for under $10), this junior-league Malbec shows sweet, jammy aromas and legitimate berry flavors. And that alone puts it ahead of the game. The palate is basically a mish-mash of berry flavors and raw tannins, but with food, preferably hamburgers or ribs, it will do the trick.",Malbec
Argentina,"A rambunctious young buck of a wine, with untamed aromas and plenty of aggressiveness from front to back. It clamps with firm tannins while delivering dark plum and other black-fruit flavors. Gets better with airing and may improve in the bottle. Now, it needs food to tame the beast.",Malbec
Argentina,"Familia Schroeder is making good, restrained wines in Neuquén. This Merlot won't rock your world but it will deliver firm, fresh raspberry flavors, food-friendly acidity and solid tannins. And it's even got some chewy sweetness.",Merlot
Argentina,"This lighter-bodied blend has a lot in common with a good Côtes-du-Rhône. It's mildly spicy but also quite fruity; the nose exudes red-berry and cinnamon aromas, while the palate is warm and just slightly oaky. A nice bistro wine.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Mildly smoky and toasty aromas lead to a lightly oaked palate that's largely defined by black cherry and some rich berry syrup. It's a full, colorful Syrah with a chunky mouthfeel and a satisfying but short finish. Drink now.",Syrah
Argentina,"Starts out with ripe dark-druit aromas, while pepper and charred beef come later. The palate is best up front, where black cherry and dark berry flavors attack well but lose steam fairly quickly. And the finish holds onto some buttery oak that one might rather not taste. But overall this is an easy 50-50 Argentine red blend.",Shiraz-Malbec
Argentina,"Green apple and lemon work the clean, easygoing nose, while the palate has jump and bounce along with citrus and peach flavors. Don't look for complexity or nuance and you'll be happy with the wine's vibrancy.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Starts out murky and sweaty, before showing cola, green herbs and leather. It's a rather jumpy, scattershot wine with plum and boysenberry flavors and a grapy, flush finish. The feeling here is that Terrazas wines were more consistent and elevated a few years ago.",Malbec
Argentina,"Jammy and attractive. The nose is wide open and full of dark berry aromas. The palate is also pretty deep, and in addition to the requisite beaming fruit you'll find licorice and molasses. Finishes on the money, and with richness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with a nice combination of mineral dust and orange marmalade, while the palate is smooth with the flavors of banana and lemon curd. Suave with a splash of  necessary acidity. As always, Luigi Bosca delivers a very good wine.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Big and earthy, with secondary aromas of pepper, chocolate and smoke supporting bold black fruit. Cassis and black cherry are the leading flavors, while the zesty yet oak-heavy finish is right on. A very good Malbec from what was an average year.",Malbec
Argentina,"This wine shows molasses and Boston baked beans on the nose along with peppery spice. The bouquet is a touch stewy, but the palate delivers core black cherry and cola along with tight, ripe tannins. The wine takes a little while to warm up and it remains saucy, but that's not uncommon for Mendoza.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Value-level Chardonnay has never really been Argentina's strong suit, but this fuller-bodied version is pretty good. It starts with citrus, orange peel and some dusty scents, which are backed by melon, apple and citrus flavors. It finishes with some pithy bitterness but overall it's nice for Mendoza Chardonnay.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A difficult wine to assess. For starters, it's heavily oaked and very dark in aromas; think tar, char and espresso. The palate is narrowly focused and tannic, with dark fruit peeking thru here and there. Finishes sheer, with coffee and bitter chocolate. Could get better with time, or it might never really open up. Needs at least another year in bottle to show its true colors.",Malbec
Argentina,"A giant smack of coffee and earth rip at you from the glass, while the palate starts out medicinally sweet before folding in chocolate and leather. The feel settles at soft, but it's not flabby. And the finishing notes of mocha-covered strawberry are pleasant.",Syrah
Argentina,"Sweet on the bouquet, although there's a bit of a lactic note. The palate is bright and fruity, but the feel is narrow and goes hard with the tannins. Finishes mildly grabby but it's fruity throughout. A good effort but a little challenging. Can you tell that it has its contradictions?",Syrah
Argentina,"Snappier and more crisp than in the past; this blend of Cabernet and Malbec hits with red-fruit aromas and a touch of vanilla. Next comes raspberry flavors mixed with cola, vanilla and a dollop of butter. Has staying power and depth, but is a little short on core fruit.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"Dense, rich and encouraging on the nose, with full blackberry flavors and a flush mouthfeel. For Argentine Cab this gets it right much more than wrong. The flavors are fairly well developed and the finish has length.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Not a bad steak or burger wine given that it offers some kicking acidity to go with sassy cherry and oak-based flavors. This is more of a forward, racy Cabernet. It doesn't lay heavily on the palate; in fact, it's a touch jumpy and staunch despite its oak cask moniker.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Having always liked this wine, which is 86% Cab and the rest Malbec and Merlot, the 2002 seems a touch bland and underwhelming. The color is dense and the nose muscular and herbal, but it peters out quickly and shows no signs that it will get better with age. Imported by Quintessential Wines, LLC.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A little loose on the bouquet, with a whiff of sulfur and leather to go with wild berry aromas. In the mouth, it's got an Old World coarseness that turns the flavor profile to pepper and espresso. At 60% Cabernet and 40% Malbec, it's worth the price.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"Leather, dark fruit and citrus peel make for a good nose, while the palate is meaty and a bit heavy as it pours on those classic dark-fruit flavors that Malbec is known for. Best to get at this one now because neither the palate nor the finish shows much acidity. A touch hollow.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big and jammy, and all in all it's a solid, good Malbec. Aromas of tar and prune give way to plum and blackberry flavors. On the finish, it's a touch salty and drying, but with food it will be smoother. Good for the money, although limited in depth and complexity.",Malbec
Argentina,"Solid, ripe and smooth on the nose, then red cherry and raspberry come forward on the zesty, tangy palate. The finish is long and healthy, but a bit monotone in its delivery. Freshness and pop are not lacking in this young Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Finding affordable but good Cab is not an easy chore, so let this solid, smoky wine fit that bill. The nose is like a cowboy campfire, complete with hickory, leather and cured meat. The palate is full-force and tannic, with plum and berry fruit. It may be slightly cooked and not for the long haul; so drink now.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Clove and other challenging aromas greet you, and never does this blend of Malbec, Cabernet, Bonarda and Merlot get it fully together. The palate seems a little reduced and short on feel, and while it widens and softens on the finish, the ride to get there is bumpy. Expect better in 2005.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Better than most Argentinean Sauvignon Blancs, and made in a fuller-bodied style. The nose has weight and wax aromas, as well as melon, and the palate features ripe, almost pithy citrus. Dried apricot and a nick of passion fruit work the finish. Drink immediately.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"A touch cooked and oaky, but with a sweet, friendly side, too. The palate rests on beefy fruit, and it's chewable and just slightly herbal in nature. Finishes leathery and tannic, with chocolate and coffee notes. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A perennial Best Buy among Argentinean Torrontes, Santa Julia always puts out a true and consistent product. The nose on the 2007 offers lime and flower blossoms, while the weighty, slightly creamy palate shows melon and papaya. Made in a riper, fuller style. Drink now.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Quite dense and ripe, with prune, earth and rubber on the nose. The depth of color coincides with the meatiness and grapiness you find on the palate, which is pleasing but modest in depth and complexity. Weighs in as a full, easy, chewy wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rich and borderline syrupy, but restrained enough to keep its focus. The mouth deals brawny red and black fruit encased in meaty tannins. And with some oak-based mocha and coffee on the finish, it is solid as a rock.",Malbec
Argentina,"From the Altos Las Hormigas gang comes this Bonarda that hits with more power than precision, yet in the long run it makes the grade as a fun wine with plenty to offer. The nose is full of dark fruit, coffee, vanilla and marzipan, while the palate and finish are equally fruity and forward. The perfect red for burgers.",Bonarda
Argentina,"More lean and tight than bulky, with licorice, pepper and leather aromas. Compact in the mouth, with spice and cherry flavors leading into a peppery, drying finish. Balanced and more traditional than many modern, beefy, unidentifiable reds. Imported by 31 Degrees South Imports.",Syrah
Argentina,"This marks the U.S. debut of Torino's organic line called Cuma, which means clean and pure in a native language. The wine is indeed that; it's a grapy, fun wine with ribald boysenberry fruit. And with air it shows some softness that makes it go down easy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rutini's value brand exhibits a lot of forced toast, popcorn and burnt notes, all of which tells us that they want us to smell and taste oak. Supporting the wood brigade is syrupy cola and ripe black cherry flavors as well as creamy chocolate finishing notes. Candied but pleasant.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Of all the large-format White Pearl varietals, this Torrontes tastes and feels the best. It has the grape's pungent aromas of acacia and talc, and the flavors are solid and persistent as the palate yields green melon and honey. Finishes tangy and fresh, meaning it hasn't yet started to fade.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Spice, rose hips and raspberry make for an open and welcoming nose. The palate delivers generic berry flavors, size, tannins and spice. It finishes a little harsh, with pepper and burnt notes. But mostly it's a solid everyday Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"A big and mauling version of Malbec. The nose is minty and dark, while the palate runs syrupy and full, with heavy black-fruit flavors darkened even more by a persistent peppery streak. Much less restrained and elegant than the Kaiken Ultra.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big and fruity, and for the most part holds together and exhibits more good qualities than its faults. The flavor profile drives full-bodied black fruit and a finish that cuts out quietly. Not over the top in any way.",Malbec
Argentina,"Over the years the Fantelli wines have not impressed, but this Torrontes works nicely, especially if you like some weight and sweetness to your white wine. The nose offers apple blossoms and honey, while the peach, pear and applesauce flavors are round and sweet. Seems to have some residual sugar.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Slightly rugged at first, with strong scents of leather, earth and subdued dark fruit. The palate is classic Malbec: soft, chewy and medium in depth. Not terribly complex or long on the finish, but satisfying.",Malbec
Argentina,"A veneer of oak and aromas of root beer greet you, while cherry and raspberry flavors work the palate. It's a lively, tannic wine with a candied, slightly resiny/minty flavor profile and finish. Best with food.",Malbec
Argentina,"Plum, blackberry and other fruit aromas work the nose, which is light and airy more than deep and concentrated. The palate is also a touch thin for a reserve-level wine, but the fruit is clean and the finish offers both chocolate and black pepper.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Starts out good, with menthol and wintergreen dominating the nose. The palate is forward and endowed with a lot of red-fruit flavors, but the mouthfeel lets it down. There's too much bounding acidity and not nearly enough lushness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Mocha, coffee and other oak-based aromas are front and center on the nose. The palate is quite sweet and rich, with cola and dark fruit flavors. Generally speaking this wine has the right qualifications to make a positive impression; it is, however, oaky and on the stewy side. Imported by Kysela Pere et Fils, Ltd.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Don't let the bright purple color and plum/prune aromas fool you: the wine looks deeper and fleshier than it is. In fact, while the palate deals heft and tannin, the depth of fruit is modest and the final package winds up being uncomplicated, but in a good way.",Merlot
Argentina,"Light fragrances of talcum powder and apricots lead off this mild-mannered blend, which runs easy and smooth before thinning out on the back palate and finish. But along the way there's good citrus and green-fruit flavors backed by adequate acidity. A good quaff for the price.",Chardonnay-Viognier
Argentina,"Good out of the blocks, with full and creamy berry aromas. The palate doesn't exactly follow that lead as it shows slightly tart red cherry and cranberry flavors. And by the finish there's even a lemony tingle. Best if you like a juicy style.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,A bit jumbled and certainly it goes heavy on the oak. But as things settle you'll find buttery vanilla notes accenting relatively solid berry fruit. The end result is pretty good. Give it some air.,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
Argentina,"La Vuelta means “the return,” and after a glass or two of this, and with modest expectations, you may want to return to this lighter-styled Malbec. Flavorwise, we're talking strawberry-, cherry- and raspberry-infused tea, while light but noticeable oaking yields finishing notes of mocha.",Malbec
Argentina,"Argentinean Rieslings come along as often as Haley's comet. But this clean, round wine is pretty good in its own right. It features dry almond, white pepper and apple flavors, with additional almond skins on the mineral, lean finish. Not entirely a novelty with 1,550 cases total production.",Riesling
Argentina,"With varietally correct aromas and nice overall balance, this ranks as a solid, fairly legitimate Argentine Viognier. Hailing from warmer San Juan province, this is a citrus- and honey-based white with size, spice and mouthfeel. For the most part it gets things right.",Viognier
Argentina,"Generic black-fruit aromas are bolstered by chocolate and char, while the palate throws up extraripe cassis and blackberry flavors. The palate shows good acidity and ample body, and while the tannins come across hard on the finish, food will help it along.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Patrick Campbell, the man behind Laurel Glen in Sonoma County, has a fondness for Argentina and South America. His Terra Buena brand has some hits and misses, and this Malbec falls right in the middle of that range. It's sweet, big (14.5% alcohol) and decadent, with candied fruit flavors and a soft, fudgy finish. Drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"Touches of cola, cherry and berry work the jammy bouquet, and the reasonably sturdy body offers up flavors of berry backed by vanilla. There's ample grab and pretty good balance to this fresh wine.",Shiraz
Argentina,"Lively from the beginning, where red-fruit aromas are toughened up by notes of leather, earth and spice. Fairly robust in the mouth, with plum, berry and pepper flavors. Substantive throughout, with firm tannins and enough oak to create mocha and vanilla on the finish. Imported by Banville & Jones Wine Merchants.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"All sorts of smoky berry, cola and controlled toast aromas get this wine going in the right direction. It tastes very good, with pure, less than bashful plum and cola flavors leading straight to a fruity, lasting finish. This may not have much sauvage, old world Syrah character; but for Argentina it's made right and registers from head to toe.",Syrah
Argentina,"A five-grape mash-up with savory aromas of roasted oak, smoke, bacon and clove aromas. Despite slightly crisp acidity, the wine is lusty and giving, with juicy cherry, cassis and other bright-flavored fruit. Good length and some chocolate on the finish send it away in fine form. 550 cases made.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Deep purple in color and fierce on the nose; there's no shortage of piercing French oak aromas to send this one on its way. But once it settles, the oak supports classy blackberry, boysenberry and peppery flavors along with a structured, dense mouthfeel.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is a lively, slightly jagged wine with full ripeness and lots of berry, spice and zip. The palate hits hard with cherry, raspberry and pepper flavors, and there's a bit of rasp and burn to the finish. Should get a little softer with more bottle age.",Merlot-Malbec
Argentina,"Warm and earthy, with a touch of sulfur that subsides with air. The palate is juicy but also sort of rich, and the flavors of mixed red fruits feature a couple of layers of potency that are followed by a compact, medium-length finish.",Malbec-Merlot
Argentina,"Bubble gum on the nose makes you wonder about carbonic maceration, but that technique wasn't used to make this fruity, simple and generally nice little Cabernet. Don't expect complexity from it, or much varietal character; this is your basic red wine with adequate sweetness and some chocolate.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Pretty good wine with only the mildest weedy, herbal notes. For the most part this is full, sunny Malbec; only a hint of green and finishing black pepper vies with the dark berry and plum flavors that one should expect. Decent balance; ordinary as a whole.",Malbec
Argentina,"Turning toward brick in color, with leaner aromas that offer dry fruit and equally dry spice notes. The palate deals mild blackberry flavors before a scratchy finish, while the feel is suspect. It seems to be fast approaching its end, meaning drink now. Made from organic grapes.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"There are fumé blancs that are oak-backed and others that aren't. This one is the former. The nose is full of toast and vanilla, while the fruit is on the ripe, weighty side, with peach, melon and lemon flavors. Fairly rich in the mouth, with whetting acidity.",Fumé Blanc
Argentina,"Big and bulky, with a mixed bag of aromas that includes field scents, rubber and baked fruit. The palate deals berry and plum flavors, while the finish tilts toward heavy and medicinal. Seems like this one got a bit overripe and sticky. The 2003 was better.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Nice on the nose. The palate is steady but on the leaner side, with prickly tannins joining berry fruit, chocolate and toast. A tighter, Patagonian style of Malbec, meaning it's firm as opposed to lush.",Malbec
Argentina,"For an everyday red that won't wreck the wallet, this juicy, fresh Malbec qualifies. It offers sweet aromas of plum and berry, and the palate follows suit with blueberry and blackberry. The depth and complexity are limited but the fundamentals and enjoyment factor are measurable.",Malbec
Argentina,"A little choppy and tannic, with thin red-fruit aromas. The palate is of medium depth, with a bit of tannin-driven rawness to make things a little harder than ideal. Otherwise it's steady and warming.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"The nose exudes popcorn, butter and spice, while the palate is downright resiny. In between all the barrel (or is it stave?) influence, the wine shows moderately plump pear and apple flavors. But the oak is always dominant, with the mouthfeel as the wine's saving grace.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Tons of color, fruit and weight add up to a big, fun but clumsy hunk of generic red wine. With a slightly slick feel and not much structure, it's a wine that's meant to go down easy.",Merlot
Argentina,"Sweet and a little foxy on the nose, with secondary aromas of air freshener. The flavors are a touch brambly and herbal, while the palate is flush and chewy but also a little tannic and choppy. Doesn't seem as thought this is as structured and serious as it was, say, four or five years ago.",Malbec
Argentina,"A little reduced and granular on the nose, with black fruit and licorice aromas filling any gaps. The flavor profile is solid, with black cherry and plum pulling the cart. Where this wine comes up short is in mouthfeel; it's tight almost to the point of sharp, with a strong essence of grape skins and tannin. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",Malbec
Argentina,"Clean, fruity and a touch candied on the bouquet. The palate is narrow but saved by ripe black cherry flavors and spice notes. Finishes with a mocha-like flavor and a crisp, clean feel. A basic but more than satisfactory Malbec. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA Inc.",Malbec
Argentina,"Bright purple in color, a sure indicator that what's to come will be jammy and rich. The nose is all boysenberry and wood, with a hint of mineral. The palate is ultraripe but a bit clumsy and oversized. Not complex but very nice in a fruit-forward, knife-and-fork manner.",Malbec
Argentina,"A spicy sort of red, with earth, leather and forest aromas. Cassis, cherry and chocolate make for a tasty palate, although there's a bit of outsized tannin, oak and heat. Sturdy, medium in terms of lushness, and broad.",Malbec
Argentina,"Solid, ripe and tasty, with hard rubber, dark berry and toast on the nose. Jammy and big on first take, yet it runs a bit thin once you bore your way to the center. Still, everything is lively and easy to like. Would be just right with a burger fresh off the grill.",Malbec
Argentina,"Deep, a touch rugged, and lively, with berry aromas accented by strong whiffs of citrus peel, especially lemon rind. Flavors of black raspberry and cassis are convincing, while the palate is textured, with smooth tannins and integrated acids. Balanced overall; one of this winery's best offerings to date.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big and burly, with a semi- syrupy nose that brings berry jam, molasses, shoe polish and crusty, baked berry aromas. But don't dismiss this Cab as overripe and over the top; it is complete and balanced, with good acidity pushing black fruit, chocolate, clove and herb flavors to their maximum expression. And it dials it in on the finish, where cola and coffee notes are just right. Drink now through 2010.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Ripe to the tipping point of being a little bit baked, but the nose of spice and mint mixed with violet, black cherry and plum is attractive. The palate on this blend is concentrated but well balanced, and the jammy flavors of plum and berry are not too heavy.",Red Blend
Argentina,"An elevated, classy wine with earth, tobacco, leather and currant aromas. It's a little saucy and saturated, but with air it unveils layering and flavors of coconut (oak-based), leather, cassis and plum. Rich on the finish, with chocolate and rubber notes. Drink now or hold through 2011.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Shows some young-vine raciness but also the sappy red cherry that is Rio Negro Malbec. Balanced and nicely oaked, with a comfortable finish that carries both chocolate and vanilla. From the maker of Fabre Montmayou.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smells a little hot and peppery, but the palate is big and expansive, with generous flavors of blackberry and vanilla. Round on the finish, if a bit generic, and not overly identifiable as Merlot. Still, it's an attractive, spicy red wine.",Merlot
Argentina,"Quite tropical on the nose, with aromas of pineapple and passion fruit. The palate is a soft, honeyed bowl of kiwi, melon, cucumber and white pepper, while the finish is dry and gets more hollow as the wine warms up. Not a classic Sauvignon, but it has its virtues.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Stick with Sur's basic 2005 Malbec because it's fresher and cleaner than this raisiny, tannic brooder that tastes a little too much of stewy fruit and liqueur.",Malbec
Argentina,"California winemaker Patrick Campbell makes this perfumed, unusual Chardonnay, which is challenged but ultimately proves its worth. While it's nothing like Burgundy or other varietally correct Chards, it does show sweet melon, mango and other candied flavors. More for those wanting a simple, sweeter style.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"This Patagonian Malbec requires patience and forgiveness. The nose is milky and green at first, but airing paroles riper, redder aromas and flavors. Ultimately there's decent berry character and plumpness but not a lot of follow through or finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cabernet may always struggle to achieve ripeness in Patagonia, but Schroeder is getting pretty decent plum and blackberry character out of this wine. The mouthfeel, however, runs kind of hard and sheer. May get better in future vintages.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Plenty of patience is required with this wine, because at first it's rough and stewy, with herb and tomato aromas. Airing reveals a blackberry core and tannin-infused oak notes, while the finish features mostly char and vanilla. Has its merits but also some weaknesses.",Merlot
Argentina,"A little buttery and wayward, but not without its good points, which include ripe apple, melon, citrus and papaya flavors. The body is fairly hefty and the finish carries heat, but overall offers decent fruit-salad flavors and pretty good balance.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Aromas of lychee fruit, pineapple, nectarine and baby powder are fairly typical and welcoming. The palate offers bright but somewhat nondescript flavors that ultimately tilt toward melon. The finish hangs in there, showing moderate grace and length. All in all this is decent Torrontes from La Rioja, a province to the north of Mendoza.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Opens with brambly, leathery aromas; later shows some true Tempranillo character, namely body, tannin and dark-fruit flavors. This is not flawed, but it is rather oaky and demanding.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Lightly tropical, with peach, citrus and pineapple aromas. The palate offers mostly sharp citrus flavors of lime and orange, and the finish holds onto that theme.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Aromas of talcum powder, tangerine and melon are decent, while the palate offers round and mildly edgy citrus and passion fruit. Finishes with some zest and pink grapefruit. A legit but limited wine; drink now.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Butterscotch, roast corn and a general aromatic flatness don't really bring you in, but the flavors of pear and peach are adequate, and the palate has some acidic kick to it. Mouthfeel and flavorwise, the wine is fine, but it has no complexity, character or pedigree to it.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"From the San Juan province, this lighter-framed blend offers a hint of mineral and honey on the nose, followed by racier orange and green melon flavors. As a whole the wine is perfectly clean but insipid. It's tangy, sheer and clean but lacks body and soul.",Chardonnay-Viognier
Argentina,"A lot of detectable oak here with earthy, cooked fruit and a flat overlay of barrel. In general, something seems missing.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Aromas of sweet melon and honey suggest an innocuous quality that's confirmed on the palate, where basic apple and pear flavors come across a bit sweet. Finishes with some scour and a little harshness.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Lightly brambled and ever so slightly green, with pleasant strawberry and raspberry aromas. The mouthfeel is a touch choppy and grabby, but it's not too thin and rough to make it unpleasant. Not bad for the price.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Lightly candied at first, but airing unveils more pure plum and raspberry aromas. Cherry, raspberry and plum flavors are standard but good, while the mouthfeel is firm and smooth enough. Mainstream all the way but likable.",Malbec
Argentina,"Heavily toasted up front, yielding popcorn, cream soda and ultimately a touch of pear. The blend is an uncommon trio of Viognier, Chardonnay and Riesling that results in a meaty palate with hidden acidity and dry citrus flavors. Unusual, with interesting qualities. As a whole, however, it isn't outstanding. Imported by Testa Wines of the World.",White Blend
Argentina,"Nice and spicy, with exotic aromatics like citrus peel, coriander and browned butter. Of course, there's solid berry fruit in there as well. Seems a touch pastry-like in the mouth, where sugars and cream come in waves. Chunky in the long run, but fun and big.",Malbec
Argentina,"Mint and rubber band scents open the bouquet, and then black fruit and marmalade aromas take over. This Bonarda is riper, softer and more cuddly than most, with ultraripe black-fruit flavors and soft tannins that make it borderline sappy. Plump, easygoing and loaded with fruit. Drink now to get the soft, giving side of this grape.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Sweet blackberry fruit and minerally darkness give this Malbec a smooth, inviting bouquet. And in the mouth, it's just as nice: light butter, juicy raspberry and plum flavors, and then dark spice on the finish. Among the best values in Argentina.",Malbec
Argentina,"Peach, melon and other slightly sweet tropical aromas lead into green melon and citrus flavors. Medium-bodied and a bit chewy, with a light, uneven finish that pushes grapefruit and soda cracker.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Typcially rustic, as are most of Weinert's wines. Tree bark, earth and cola are apparent on the saucy, traditional bouquet, while the palate is a touch raw and herbal, with tomato and oregano accenting medium-weight red fruit. For some this is the right style; for others it won't do the trick. Imported by Broadbent Selections, Inc.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Basically a simple, creamy red; the strawberry and chocolate flavors are easy to like and not hard to get. Not as purple and lush as many, as it deals road tar, raspberry and citrus peel on the nose. Imported by Dylain Produce, LLC.",Malbec
Argentina,"Quite roasted and ripe up front, with a heavy burnt/toasted scent that covers up most of the fruit that might want to get out. Plump and candied on the palate, with a sweetness that seems simple and out of place. Creamy and warm on the finish, with thickness. Questionable in terms of its polish and finesse. Imported by Wine Source Selections.",Malbec
Argentina,"A wonderful wine from the Uco Valley of Mendoza that opens with fine fruit, richness and molten earth. The palate is big as they come but not hard and out of whack, and the flavors are an amalgam of rich black plum, berry fruit, fig paste and chocolate. Smoky and sultry on the back end, with mocha and coffee for finishing notes. Drink now through 2014.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Not a bad value. The wine is a touch reduced and short on mouthfeel and aromatics, but it still delivers creamy vanilla flavors, raspberry essence and decent density. The sum of all its parts is better than the individual components. Best now, and in casual settings.",Malbec
Argentina,"Better than jug wine even if it comes in a big bottle, with clean, lightly expressive cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. There's a little heat and roughness to the finish, but given the league that it's playing in you can't complain about the overall quality of this Mendoza Cabernet. A big-time barbecue or party wine.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Opens with a smoke shack full of hickory and jerky before settling in a dark mass. The palate is sweet and a touch awkward, with heavy Port-like weight and strange but provoking berry flavors. An odd blend of Malbec, Cab and Syrah that needs fine tuning.",Red Blend
Argentina,"For the price, this is pretty good. Not very Syrah-like, but if you enjoy plum, cherry and currant flavors along with pretty good mouthfeel and balance, you'll get it here.",Shiraz
Argentina,"Warm, earthy, leathery and grapy, with a mildly tart, underdeveloped palate that offsets any roughness with a blanket of creamy oak resulting in flavors of berries and milk chocolate. With more focus, riper fruit and less oak, this wine could better.",Malbec
Argentina,"Almost sugar-beet sweet on the nose, with a good dose of oak and size. The palate is expectedly big, but with fairly hard tannins and limited depth of fruit. Ultimately there's not much cushion, so it seems hard.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Rhubarb and tomato leaf are strongly present on the nose, followed by grassy flavors and a hollow, thin mouthfeel. Septima is Spanish-owned, and this 800-case bottling seems like a nod to the homeland. But it tastes anything but Spanish.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Lightly tropical on the nose, yet nutty and fading on the palate. There's some dried fruit flavors and some acidity to keep it hopping. But in the grand scheme of things this doesn't come close to taking over center stage.",Chardonnay-Viognier
Argentina,"The bouquet has a lot of burnt character, particularly rubber, and the palate has too much corn, citrus pith and peach pit. Shows vibrant acidity but little finesse.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Overripe. The nose has thick citrus and cantaloupe aromas, while the palate shows chunky melon and citrus juice. Extremely round but limited in terms of what it offers.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Lively black cherry and plum aromas indicate that this slightly older wine is still vibrant and healthy. The palate is solid, tannic and medium in weight, with sweet but balanced dark-fruit flavors. This is a tasty, well-made, familiar style of Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Saturated Malbec, with an opaque color and dense, sweet aromas that are slightly floral and pastry-like. Big and rich in the mouth, with bold cassis, blackberry and plum flavors floating on a soft, almost jammy structure. Finishes full and oily in texture. Rich and ready to drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark fruit and leather on the nose seem fine, yet the palate is high-toned and starchy, with sharp flavors of cherry, plum and mushroom doing battle with severe tannins. And it's a touch saucy and salty on the finish. Imported by Victoire Imports.",Syrah
Argentina,"Bright in color and jammy on the nose, with aromas of bubble gum and blueberry. Candied in the mouth, with flavors of sugary plum and cherry. More of a junior varsity wine; it shows some talent but needs more practice. Imported by Stanza.",Syrah
Argentina,"Runs toward the sweet side, with fruit syrup and candied apple on the nose. Lemon-lime is the front and center flavor component, while the finish runs sweet and sour, with a sugary aftertaste.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Flat and basic, with charred secondary aromas. Simple red fruit with rubbery tannins make for an average palate. Easy enough but hard to find anything special or exciting to go on about. Imported by Wine Source Selections.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Floral and spring-like up front, but also smells too much like air freshener or dish soap. Plump pear and cantaloupe flavors are adequate, but the candied finish and heavy sweetness lean toward dull and heavy. Not bad but has faults.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Starts hard and rubbery before opening to show more wood and toast than clean, approachable fruit. Kind of buttery and woody on the palate, where red fruit sits in reserve. Sort of lean in terms of flavor; limited. Imported by Oenophilia Imports.",Malbec
Argentina,"Very oaky, with coconut and raw wood making up the bulk of the bouquet. Wood is the recurring theme throughout, with just a bit of dark fruit making an appearance. Very hard, tannic and tough.",Merlot
Argentina,"Solid enough, with standard black-fruit aromas that show raisin but also adequate freshness. Black cherry is the dominant flavor component, backed by a finish that's decently textured and a touch chocolaty. Not great, but not bad for Tannat.",Tannat
Argentina,"Jammy and condensed to start with, but ultimately the nose checks in as unexpressive. Intense in the mouth but limited in its depth and scope. There's blackberry early and mocha late, but the feel is hard. Quite tannic and unyielding. It's one-third each Cabernet, Malbec and Merlot. Imported by Winebow.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Ripe and a bit heavy, with aromas of leather and charcoal. A dark-styled but basic Malbec with chunky plum and cassis flavors. Round in the mouth, with a chalky, mildly tannic finish. Nothing exceptional but a good, balanced specimen.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with a full punch bowl of light, flowery, fruity aromas and backs that up with mixed fruit flavors along with touches of mineral, green herbs and fresh lettuce. With 20% Chardonnay stiffening 80% Torrontès, this wine shows a little something different. Imported by Appellation Imports.",White Blend
Argentina,"Round, simple and easy to enjoy if you don't mind a lack of Viognier typicity replaced by chunky apple aromas and flavors. There's also some citrus and apricot to bulk up the flavor profile. Overall it's a full-bodied but indifferent white. Drink right away for best results.",Viognier
Argentina,"Coconut, green herbs and fresh-cut wood work the nose, followed by fairly herbal berry flavors. There is oak throughout, and mildly coarse tannins, thus the structure is solid.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Bold berry aromas turn a little sweet and simple with airing, while the palate deals plum and berry flavors on a tight, tannic frame. Bright and colorful but fairly rough and basic in what it has to offer.",Merlot
Argentina,"If this isn't one of the strangest, most unique Sauvignon Blancs on the market, then please tell us what is. With a tan/peach color, this wine has its own agenda. The palate pushes peach, cantaloupe and floral notes, but where's the acidity and where's the grassiness?",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Big and colorful, with soupy aromas blended with a waft of heavy berries. The palate is packed with anonymous red fruits, but the mouthfeel is pretty hard and miserly. Tastes reasonably good but has little in common with Spanish Tempranillo.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Salmon colored, with light melon and almond aromas that are hardly distinct but by the same token are nice enough. Sweet and simple in the mouth, with no discernible fruit flavor to latch onto. Imported by Broadbent Selections, Inc.",Rosé
Argentina,"Spins a ton of raw berry and plum aromas along with oak, and the wine is plenty flavorful. Problem is, it's pretty bumpy and aggressive, with jagged tannins and a fiery feel. Good in some ways; rough in others. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Shiraz
Argentina,"Damp earth and a leafy accent render the nose less than fruity, while the mouth is round and grabby, with basic Cabernet flavors and hard tannins. Short on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Pretty solid aromatically, and nicely colored, but goes sharp, lean and tart in the mouth. Shows some cherry flavor, but also displaced citrus. Too much austerity and overt acidity.",Syrah
Argentina,"Too many things to take issue with here for it to rate any higher. The nose features chocolate-covered raisin and tomato sauce, while the lean palate deals brambly cherry and berry flavors. Lacks persistence and notable bright spots.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Light yellow in tint, with big tropical aromas centering on melon. Tastes more lemony and dry than the nose might suggest, with a strong, astringent blast of green apple on the finish.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Sweet cherry aromas seem almost like Grenache atop graham crackers, while the palate is lean, green and topped off by brandied cherry. Adequate as a cheap quaffer but not up to the next level.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Broad up front but pasty, with olive and soy sauce added in. The cherry and berry flavors are zesty but nondistinct, while the finish is lean and hits with cranberry and cherry. Also shows a bit of compost.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Nondistinguished red wine is how to best describe this one. It has some rhubarb as well as berry, while the feel is racy and zesty. Arguably scratchy and a bit green.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Mute on the nose, with only rubber cement and anonymous dark fruit showing up. Tastes of ripe plum, carob and burnt toast, while the finish offers vanilla shadings then a blast of heat. Not a smooth operator.",Merlot
Argentina,"Bright but kind of light, with attractive red-fruit aromas. The mouth, however, is a touch stark and zesty, with juicy, jumpy cherry and plum flavors. Not overly stellar nor does it try to reach very far; good for Bonarda.",Bonarda
Argentina,"The sweet and floral aromas may be too close to air freshener to be convincing. Almond candy, orange and dried apricot flavors work the palate, which finishes lemony and on the pithy side. Drink now.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Volatile at first, with more than a hint of vinegar to the nose. Airing helps it along, revealing brambly fruit along with tough tannins. Smells too much like a dairy; barely worth a look.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Port, anyone? This is a prune-filled, raisiny wine. Naturally, it lacks balance and mouthfeel, which is replaced by a grating, starchy feel. Overall it has a few redeeming qualities and an okay finish.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Smells like raspberry or strawberry Kool-Aid, with appropriately “funky” flavors of rhubarb, raspberry and burnt sugar. The mouthfeel is rather scouring and acidic.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Warm black-fruit aromas along with earth and controlled oak give this Malbec a nice bouquet, and the palate features full berry flavors and a dark-spice accent. The finish is smooth, mellow and slightly chocolaty. Satisfying, legitimate Malbec in every way.",Malbec
Argentina,"One of the best Argentine value Chardonnays on the market. The nose is stylish, with butterscotch, honeyed apple and vanilla notes. Smooth on the palate, with more than adequate apple and peach flavors, and then pure and fairly long on the finish. For clarity and real Chardonnay character, there aren't many better options than this, especially for $12.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Once you cut through the heavy, minty oak, there's a decent wine hiding in the folds. The body carries reasonably ripe black cherry and raspberry flavors as well as plenty of wood-generated tannin, but does it taste much like Syrah? I find it more generic and woody than varietal.  Imported by Excelsior Wine & Spirits.",Syrah
Argentina,"Earthy and mildly lactic on the nose, with tight, lean, herbal flavors. Doesn't rise above mediocre.",Malbec
Argentina,"This colorful, clumsy wine shows glaring powdered-drink and candied cherry aromas and flavors, and while it's kind of scouring and rough it manages to make its mark via its juicy ripeness. Not a stellar wine but has its merits; the blend is Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Bonarda.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Holds it together for the most part, but this isn't what you'd call a focused or interesting wine. The nose is mildly fruity, while the palate is shapeless and doesn't deliver recognizable Chard flavors. It rates as a generic dry white wine with hints of melon and peach.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Mildly grassy and dilute on the nose, with sweet, candied berry flavors and a sticky, woody finish. It's fairly full in the mouth, but it lacks the precision, darkness and focus of a top-flight Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Most of Bousquet's wines are enigmatic. They show some good qualities but also signs of overcropping and underripeness. That said, this wine is typical: it's scattershot in its delivery of green-infused berry fruit, tannins and wood. It's O.K. but never settles down. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Can't say that the heavy dose of oak on this wine is helping the cause. The nose is quite resiny and cloying, while the palate is creamy and full, but loaded with wood chip and vanilla flavors. As might be expected, even more oak flavor dominates the finish.",Chardonnay-Viognier
Argentina,"Simple jammy aromas lead to a hard, acidic palate offers some red fruit flavor but also an undercurrent of field greens. A lasting streak of bell pepper on the finish doesn't help bring it around.",Merlot
Argentina,"Leather, burnt bush and leafy, green Cabernet aromas get it off the mark in questionable fashion. The palate offers some berry flavor but it's chewy, buttery and off-center. Not a whole lot going for it.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Heavy, with aromas of cornflakes and peach syrup. Unctuous and chunky as can be, with sweetness dialed up to the max. Finishes like a bull in a China shop, with canned pear, honey and raw sugar.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Less than ripe on the nose, with hay and green notes. Yet the palate is sweet and sugary. Hence the front end and back end are at odds with each other.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Slightly harsh aromas of radish and leather are a little raw. Tastes like fresh nectarines and berries, then turns a bit mealy on the finish. Imported by The Wandering Epicurean.",Rosé
Argentina,"Ripe, with leather, balsamic and prune aromas. Saturated in the mouth, but ultimately it's narrow in scope. On the finish, creamy oak rises up to leave butter and resin flavors. A fairly big wine with ample barrel influence.",Malbec
Argentina,"Light-bodied and more in line with traditional, quaffable Torrontès, this one offers a whiff of orange blossom and lemon in front of melon, kiwi and lime flavors. Good in texture, as it doesn't try to do too much. Imported by Southern Wine Group.",Torrontés
Argentina,"A lot of up-front oak greets you, with sweet fruit and brown sugar in reserve. Cassis, plum and vanilla work the palate, which has some edge and tannin to it. Fairly well balanced, with some structure. No one will mistake it for sophisticated but what's here works. Imported by Winesellers Ltd.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Floral and sweet, but not that light or ethereal. At 14.5% this represents the heavy, seriously ripe side of Torrontès. Flavors of pineapple and nectarine are borderline oily, while the finish toes the line of being aggressive. Flavorful but a rumbler. Imported by Banville & Jones Wine Merchants.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Light citrus, grapefruit and oak notes are nice openers. Peach, melon and other fruits grace the palate. Shows crispness in addition to oak, and the finish is lasting and round. Easy to get; pretty solid overall.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Interesting floral, herb, cherry and chocolate-mint aromas are a good preview of the racy black cherry and berry flavors that rule the palate. The acidity is a bit pointed, giving the wine an edgy feel. But with elevated flavors as well as cola and chocolate on the finish it comes across nice and ready to drink.",Malbec
Argentina,"Alamos takes Merlot to the next level with this ripe, jammy, crusty offering. The black fruit on the nose is dense and pure, the mouthfeel is round and generous, and the flavors of ripe plum and berry ring true. Layered, long and easygoing on the finish. Very nice for Argentinean Merlot.",Merlot
Argentina,"This is one of the best—if not the best—yet from this producer. Alluring plum, berry and cola aromas meet every requirement of a very good Malbec, while the palate is fresh, sturdy and shows a cool mix of red fruit, chocolate and spice. Even the finish is abnormally long and smooth for an under-$10 wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pure and stout, with prime black-fruit aromas supported by toasty oak and mineral-like char. Blackberry is the lead flavor on the thick, dense palate, while the finish is solid if a little sedentary. Nicely focused and forward; probably what most people are looking for from Argentinean Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Brambly and sour on the nose, with berry jam in support. The wine gets leaner and meaner as it expands, finishing with raw tannins, buttery false-tasting oak and additional bramble.",Shiraz
Argentina,"Phebus is a new label from Fabre Montmayou, and frankly this wine has issues. It smells a lot like gumballs and a wet, dirty dog. It doesn't have much substance or flow, and that gamy, wet-dog character is persistent, even on the flavor profile.",Malbec
Argentina,"Almost transparent in color, with leafy, lightly baked aromas. The palate offers tart raspberry and hard, citric tannins and acidity.",Merlot
Argentina,"This old-timer proves that Argentinean Malbec is not a great cellar dweller. This smells, tastes and feels much older than its eight years. It's full of tobacco, dried spices and a dominating leafiness. The blend is 70% Syrah and 30% Malbec.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Rubbery and overly woody, and the palate really burns along with high acidity and short, staccato fruit flavors. Zesty and challenging throughout; it just doesn't push the right buttons given its reserve status and price.",Malbec
Argentina,"This Tempranillo is leafy and leathery, with light raspberry aromas backed by thin plum and berry flavors. It's an aggressive, standard red wine that's neither here nor there.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"With little to compare it to, it's hard to evaluate the correctness of this Semillon sweetie from Argentina. Let's just say that it's a weird wine that carries a vivid yellow color and aromas and flavors of honey, corn syrup and hominy.",Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Sweet berry aromas are also noticeably green and medicinal, while the palate offers raspberry flavors with a giant supplement of leafy, weedy flavors. On one hand the wine has some class and style; on the other hand questionable purity and ripeness stand out.  Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Merlot
Argentina,"This Cab is sheer and tannic, with red plums and stern berry flavors. Adequate initially but the heat and tannins soon cover the palate.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dormant and a bit chemical on the nose, with rubbery fruit and a lean body. Woody and borderline hot on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"Clean but weightless, with little substance or stuffing to it. This is a cool-climate, Patagonian Chard from young vines, hence it is reticent and watery. The winery's pricier Patagonian Select is a better option.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Something seems afoot with Sur de los Andes' so-called Gran Reserva Malbecs. Both the 2004 and epecially this '05 are wines that don't handle their oak well. This wine has an aromatic package of green tobacco and ash, while the wood burns its way through the palate. A rough ride that gets marginally better with a lot of swirling and patience.",Malbec
Argentina,"Good from the beginning, with deep berry aromas touched up by mocha, vanilla and road tar. The palate of cassis, black fruit and light herbs is juicy and lively, and while the finish is standard in terms of feel and length, it offers oak-driven coconut and spice flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"This unusual marriage of Pinot Noir and Malbec has a familiar set of aromas and flavors. There's raspberry, tobacco and lemon peel on the nose, while the palate tastes of blackberry and tobacco, with some sweetness. Not pushy, a little strange, and overall very good.",Red Blend
Argentina,"This is the kosher version of Gran Malbec made by Flechas, and it's concentrated and rich, with an oily sort of feel along with fairly soft tannins. Aromas of roasted fruits hint at the olive, baked plum and tempered herb flavors that come later, and the finish is thick and chewy. A broad, succulent but shy Malbec. Drink now.",Malbec
Argentina,"The nose is full of mellow raspberry and cherry, while the palate is fleshy and round, with blackberry and a touch of raisin. Plump, not edgy, and ready to drink, with coffee and mocha notes on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"This wine is always a bit waxy and heavy, as vanilla and baked-corn aromas are prominent. In the mouth, potent acidity propels apple, mango and peach flavors, while the finish is lively to say the least. At 13.9% it's a heavyweight. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Fresh and full of zesty apple aromas that lead into a palate of cider, citrus and spice. Light in the mouth, with proper acidity. Generally fits the bill as a good, easy quaffer. Imported by Global Wine Imports LLC.",White Blend
Argentina,"A fat Chard made in the New World style, meaning it pushes a block of oak across the bouquet and then pours on the textured apple, nut and butterscotch flavors. Lacks complexity and vitality, but offers ample size and richness. Drink immediately.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Fresh on the bouquet, with spring flowers and cherry blossom. Simple melon and peach flavors are less than ideal, while the finish is soft and easy but devoid of much nuance or flavor. Clean enough; not terribly thrilling.",Malbec
Argentina,"This new Patagonian winery is doing better with its reds. This SB is honeyed and slightly mealy; the palate starts out soft and chunky, with apple and peach flavors that are less than zesty and slightly oxidized. Still, complexity arises as there's a lasting butterscotch taste that is not unpleasant.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Extremely ripe and concentrated but arguably a bit too massive for its own good. That said, we love the wine's tobacco, cassis and inky qualities, but worry a little about the lemony oak character and overall potency. Deep as midnight in terms of flavors, with black fruits galore setting up a richly packed, ultraripe finish. New World to the max but very tasty and rich.",Syrah
Argentina,"The nose is a dark, clumsy confluence of rubber, stewed cherry and horseradish, and the palate is both tangy and bouncy, with a hard feel and plenty of acidic kick. Misses too many marks to rate better.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"This variety doesn't seem to have adapted well to Patagonia. For starters, it has virtually no inherent Sauvignon Blanc character: it's oaky, sour and scratchy, with a lean and watery finish. It's not a foul or dirty wine; but it isn't what we've come to expect from SB.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Candied fruit aromas lead to a hard, underdeveloped palate that houses tannin and oddly flavored raspberry notes. Not a lot else to say about it.",Malbec
Argentina,"Hot and earthy up front, with mocha-like aromas. The palate and finish are syrupy, and the wine ends in a pool of chocolate and berry extract. This is an example of why Argentine Syrah has not found its groove.",Syrah
Argentina,"What else can you say about this three-grape blend other than it's heavily oaked and doesn't have the fruit or complexity to handle it? The bouquet is like a trip through the sawmill, and the palate is akin to biting into a log.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Flat and soupy, as if the life had been drained out of it. Barely acceptable, even with a big production of 40,000 cases.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Too funky, animal and vegetal to recommend. The wine has color and size but the aromas and flavors just aren't that pleasant. Tastes more like rhubarb and carob than fresh berries.",Malbec
Argentina,"It's hard to understand why Santa Julia would want to make an oaked Pinot Grigio in Mendoza, but they did. And we find it as odd and difficult to get through as you might expect. The nose is nutty and full of popcorn, while the palate offers heady, honeyed apricot and peach flavors.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"Tan in color, with musky aromas. Flavors of cucumber and citrus alert you to the fact that this is Sauvignon Blanc; because nothing else really does. Overall it's a foxy, musky wine without much SB character.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Quite green and on the verge of deserving the dreaded weedy designation, this Cab fails to show much ripe fruit character even if the mouthfeel is decent. It's like a wet-vintage cru bourgeois Bordeaux.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Rowdy and aggressive stuff; where's the charm and poise, even in a value-priced wine? The nose is rambling and penetrating, while the palate is tart like sucking candy. A raw wine that should be better.",Malbec
Argentina,"Mildly raisiny on the bouquet. The palate is round and full-bodied, with blackberry and roasted plum flavors backed by smooth tannins and a chocolaty, savory finish. Heavier and warmer than some red blends, but not clumsy or overdone.",Malbec-Merlot
Argentina,"Ripe and big, with campfire aromas and black fruit. There's a bulky molasses and brown sugar element to this wine along with blackberry and creamy mocha. Ripe and rich for a value-priced Malbec, but that said, it teeters on the verge of being syrupy. Best if you like creamy New World reds.",Malbec
Argentina,"Among Argentine high fliers this blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Tannat lacks a little. The nose is mildly stemmy and herbal, while the flavors of wild berry and cranberry are a touch reedy. Tannat and Petit Verdot are not commonplace grapes, and maybe that's why the wine seems sort of herbal and edgy despite having its good qualities.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Here is how you get Torrontés right. The nose sheds dusty lemon and apple blossom aromas, which are followed by lemon-lime and citrus flavors. The palate has solid density and stuffing, and the finish evolves toward orange and pineapple.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Turned earth, berry jam and candied sweetness on the nose portend full-force black-fruit flavors that are grainy, bold and not terribly refined. Standard fare Cabernet, yet a little on the simple, hard side. Imported by Ex-Cellars Wine Agencies, Inc.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Round, plump and creamy up front, with intensely sweet flavors of apple juice, pineapple, candied lemon peel and oranges. If you like easy tropical flavors it has its merits. Chardonnay connoisseurs, however, may find it too simple and sweet.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Floral and zesty on the nose, with just a hint of butterscotch. The mouth, however, is live-wire and tangy, as the fruit is citrusy and shrill but definitely clean. Finishes racy and free. A no-oak style that mostly works.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"From a global wine bottler named Xavier Flouret, this Torrontés is a full-fruited, oily specimen. The nose boasts lychee, perfume and acacia, while the palate pumps out melon and apple flavors. Big it is; precise it's not. But it's rewarding. “Flaca” may mean skinny in Spanish, but this wine is far from that.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Blackberry and plum aromas have just enough leather and horsehide accents to give this wine character. The mouth is centered squarely on purple fruits like plum and wild blackberry, and the feel and finish are comfortable and fresh. Lively and with all the basics in the right places.",Merlot
Argentina,"Tight on the nose, with hints of resin, lemon peel and black fruit that smell inviting when all added up. The palate is juicy, arguably a bit acidic, and runs fresh with red cherry and plum flavors. Spunky and properly tannic.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"If a Chardonnay could suffer from something called “barrel breath,” this one would. It's like a bowl full of lacquer and heady melon, and the palate is sweet, sweet, sweet. There's vanilla, marshmallow and resin along with more typical melon and citrus. A case of more being less; just too much oak and candy to rate higher.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Yellowish rather than pale in color, which indicates some overripeness that's confirmed on the chunky, apple-driven nose. Big on the palate as well, with tropical fruit preceding a lazy finish. Big in flavor but lacks touch. Imported by Cabernet Corporation.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Red plum pushed by hard smoke aromas create a firm, rubbery bouquet. Sweet and oozing on the palate, with a lot of run-away flavors. Not terribly soft or refined but full of flavor and power. Base-level. Imported by Quintessential LLC.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A bit heavy and muddled up front, but that could be construed as being earthy. The flavors run a touch green, but along with that leaning there's zesty red fruit and some tannin. Grabby but not harsh. Imported by Vineyard Brands.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Chunky and full, but not totally pure. The palate holds form, showing sharp flavors of strawberry and cherry. Some light oak and vanilla works the finish, while some leftover acidity creates a tangy overall impression. Imported by Global Wine Imports LLC.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"A light but obvious blast of coconut opens things, followed by aromas of black fruit, vanilla and toast. The palate is fresh and zesty, with snappy acidity adding tang and zest to the flavors of plum, raspberry and cassis. Overall it's composed but sort of short, while the finish is medium long and ends with a dash of mocha. Seems a little on the lean side while still showing the up side of Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Crusty on the nose, with aromas of leather, saucy fruit and alcohol. The wine is full and sweet, with ripe, sturdy flavors of blackberry, plum and raisin followed by fudge and herbs. It blends richness with agility.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark and full-bodied, with a big bouquet of coconut, char and blackberry. The palate is thick and chunky, and that seems right given the wine's sweet black-fruit and chocolate flavors. Add in some oak, baking spice and mocha and you've got a solid, tasty, generous wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dry berry fruit and spice make for a solid but very common and regular type of nose. The palate is based on a lively bead of acids that lift and amplify the flavors of plum and cherry. A little hot but solid on the finish, thus it leaves a tangy final impression.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Chunky and full, with raisin, oak and mocha aromas. The palate comes across round and healthy, with mint and herb notes accenting plum and blackberry flavors. To justify its “gran reserva” moniker the oak is front and center, but the fruit is solid.",Malbec
Argentina,"Norton's Lo Tengo (I Got It) line has a winner in this vivacious Malbec. It's light and a little candied on the nose, but also floral and attractive. The palate is medium-bodied and fresh, with raspberry, cherry and cassis flavors. Clean, mildly tannic, good acidity: what more do want from an inexpensive, trendy red?",Malbec
Argentina,"Straightforward plum and rubber aromas seem slightly baked or burnt, while the palate features hard peppery flavors at the center of a powerful yet mildly scouring red-fruit palate. Not offensive but basic and raw. Imported by South Valley Wines.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Honey, cornflakes and apple juice aromas sit in front of lively but basic apple and melon flavors. Fairly full in weight, with ripe forward flavors. Not a polished gem by any means but decent enough.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Leafy red fruit, candied licorice and a touch of toast add up to the bare basics on the nose. Tangy and short in the mouth, with a bit too much acidity resulting in a scratchy mouthfeel. Cherry and red raspberry are the dominant flavors. Imported by 31 Degrees South Imports.",Syrah
Argentina,"Heavy and dark, with raisin, animal crackers and tobacco aromas. Offbeat on the palate, with forceful but awkward blackberry flavors and cloying, hard-hitting tannins. Short flavors; hot and baked. Imported by Biagio Cru & Estate Wines, LLC.",Syrah
Argentina,"The bouquet initially yields iodine and ham aromas, but airing settles it down. Sweet and full of apple flavors in the mouth, while the finish veers dangerously close to cider-like. Struggles to make its mark.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Best at the beginning, where balsamic notes blend with earth and leather to create a dark, brooding nose. The palate, however, is dull and reduced; it's like a bite of devil's food cake: one bite is enough. Seems like the grapes were picked too late; it's stewy.",Malbec
Argentina,"A power-packed blend of 60% Cabernet and 40% Merlot that offers mossy aromas, earth and lush black fruit scents. The palate is lively yet balanced, with saturated wild berry, toast, anise and pepper flavors. Dark, toasted and showing licorice on the finish. A little hot and aggressive, so drink in late 2010 through 2012.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Rustic yet complete, with dark, sweet aromas of toasted coconut, mint and berry syrup. The palate is juicy and balanced, and that's really the key in distinguishing the top Bonardas from the more frequently found hard and scouring ones. In our book, Broquel is a Bonarda you can count on.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Powerful in Zinny character, this blend of Dry Creek and Russian River grapes bursts with brawny flavors of wild berries, chocolate-covered mint, tobacco and pepper, wrapped into sturdy tannins. Shows real class and character.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Opens with roasted fruit notes and an earthy character that qualifies as intriguing. The palate is fresh, wide and healthy, with cassis, blackberry and a hint of rhubarb that adds some edge. Overall this is a solid Cabernet; it finishes long and with coffee and mocha. Drink now into 2010.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"In this price class, consistency is a virtue, and year after year Santa Julia's Malbec delivers the basics and a little bit more. This wine has some up-front oak to give warmth, lemon and a mocha or root beer quality to the bouquet. The palate revolves around plum and wild berry flavors, and there's no shortage of oak and mint on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"For something a little lighter, more herbal and different than the usual Mendoza heavyweight, this multigrape blend offers aromatic notes of pancetta, herb, fennel and dried cherry along with flavors of blueberry and elderflower. It's light-to-medium in size, with a Rhône-style personality. Drink now.",Red Blend
Argentina,"A weird wine with early sneaker-sole aromas that change to root beer and liqueur later on. The palate is soft, almost devoid of tannin, with sugary black fruit that seems either a touch cooked or a close cousin of recioto. Lacks the edge of a balanced wine. Imported by Epic Wines.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A touch of mulch and smoked meat make for a confounding, less than pure bouquet. And in the mouth, there's rubbery black cherry followed by an almost salty finish. Doesn't seem complete; something is missing, namely polish and purity of fruit.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Smells like a tropical fruit salad, with chunky, flat pineapple in the lead. Diluted melon is the main flavor, with some grapefruit coming on late. Short on texture and depth. Imported by Winesellers Ltd.",Viognier
Argentina,"Green and raisiny at the same time, which isn't a good combination. The wine seems ultra ripe and lacking in red fruit, acids and other balancing elements. Harvested too late? Regardless, it isn't working.",Malbec
Argentina,"Apple cider and caramel on the nose, and that aromatic combo doesn't stir much interest. Tastes like mulled cider, while the finish is thick with caramel and toffee. A heavy, oily Chardonnay that could use better balance and flavors.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"While all of Trapiche's single-vineyard Malbecs are excellent, this is the rock star of the group. From 50-year-old vines, Coletto offers prune, fruitcake and cedary aromas in front of a jammy but structured palate. Smooth as silk with hints of Port. A lovely, lush wine that should age well through 2012.",Malbec
Argentina,"With floral aromas, toasty oak notes and solid berry fruit, this bottling is the best among Trapiche's 2007 single-vineyard Malbecs. The palate features smoky berry fruit but also high acidity and some scour. Fortunately it's also layered and structured. Will do best with meats and fatty foods. Drink now through 2015.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark in color, with creamy aromas that hint at prune and chocolate. And while the wine is certainly soft and saturated, it isn't overly flabby. Still, it's ultraripe tasting, with rich blackberry and fudge flavors. Nocturnal in style, which is perfect for the jaguar (Yaguareté).",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark on the nose, with baked black-fruit aromas, graham cracker and charcoal. There's creamy oak on the palate, while the cherry, plum and herb flavors are pleasant. Finishes with fresh-roasted coffee notes and a wave of leftover acidity.",Malbec
Argentina,"Airy floral notes and a whiff of strawberry on the nose give this wine a lighter outlook, yet the palate is still fairly full-bodied as it offers ripe blackberry and chocolate flavors. Maybe a touch herbal here and there, but geneally speaking this is a solid, chewy Cabernet. 10,000 cases made.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Despite being a bit fiery on the nose, the aromas of plum and pepper come together and set the stage for solid, well-meaning black cherry and cassis flavors. First and foremost, the wine is healthy and sturdy. Beyond that, don't expect much in the way of richness or complexity.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Crisp aromas of wet stones, lime and eau de toilette give this Torrontés the proper air. It's lean and cut in the mouth, with green apple, pear and nectarine flavors coasting on a wave of bracing acidity. Finishes clean as a whistle.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Rubbery and a bit herbal on the nose, with a smack of rhubarb-like sharpness offset by deeper, more common berry fruit aromas. The palate is chunky and sweet, with meaty plum and blackberry flavors that lead to coffee and mocha on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"A hulk of a wine with forced oak that results in aromas of mint, char, citrus peel and smoke. The palate is endowed with ample black cherry, raspberry and mocha flavors, while the finish mixes orange peel, chocolate and a lot of leftover wood resin. Interesting but very oaked up and not quite in perfect balance.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Smells like cherry sucking candy and immature red fruit. Very colorful and bold, with sharp flavors and a jumpy mouthfeel. Limited in what it has to offer. Imported by Wine Source Selections.",Syrah
Argentina,"Starts out smoky and seemingly ripe, but the nose is the best part. The palate, by contrast, is tight, gritty and the flavors are awkward at best. Really not that consistent and loses focus the more you get into it. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Syrah
Argentina,"Root beer, wintergreen and black plum aromas announce a certain level of ripeness, and in the mouth it's even riper, with syrupy flavors and very little snap or pop. This is a heavy wine that takes soft and creamy to the outer limits. Corpulent and too low in acidity.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Intensely yellow in color, with heavy popcorn and toast aromas. Runs decidedly bitter and nutty across the palate, while the feel is oily and dull. Not that pleasurable.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A heavy load, with berry jam, marshmallow and other unconvincing aromas. Dark as night but clumsy as can be, with thick flavors and a core sweetness that doesn't seem natural. Imported by Global Wine Imports LLC.",Syrah
Argentina,"Hints of melon and citrus on the nose, but the palate is limited in what it offers. Flavors of dried apricot is the best you get from this short, somewhat bitter wine. Not concentrated; stretched thin. Imported by Winesellers Ltd.",Pinot Grigio
Argentina,"For the second straight year, Chacayes scores major points among serious Argentine wines competing for the world's attention. This blend of 80% Malbec and 20% Cabernet is deep, dark and seductive. It's all about compact, intense fruit supported by hefty tannins. Very nice and perfectly ripe. Hold a couple of years for best results.",Malbec
Argentina,"Deep as a country well, with lush black plum and blackberry aromas as well as lead pencil and balsam wood. The palate is solid but not overly tough or complex, and the flavors of cassis, berry and black cherry are more than satisfying. A pure, textbook modern red wine; drinkable now and over the next couple of years.",Malbec
Argentina,"A touch leathery and cooked at first, but with time the bouquet deftly blends saucy, savory Syrah aromas with sun-baked black fruit notes. The palate is saturated and chunky, with aggressive sweet-and-sauvage flavors of grilled meats, spice and burnt brown sugar. Roasted, warm and mildly bitter on the finish. Drink now through 2012.",Syrah
Argentina,"Quite intense, with blasting aromas of blackberry, coconut, cocoa and even leather and horse hide. It's 65% Tannat and 35% Malbec, and as a whole it's big, grabby, tight and full of blackberry and raspberry flavors that bring an herbal twist. Smoky and herbal on the finish.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Solid, basic Malbec with plenty of fruit and power. The palate is plump, mildly oaked and tastes of honest plum and blackberry. It's ripe and round, with medium tannins and then spice, licorice and black fruit on the tail. A very good wine with no skipped beats.",Malbec
Argentina,"Tight, rubbery and smoky at first, and then it shows more vanilla and sweet berry fruit after it has opened up. The mouthfeel is nice and fulfilling, while the flavors of black fruit, nutmeg and mild toast are pleasing. Nothing too exotic or out of the ordinary here. Just good red wine at a good price.",Syrah
Argentina,"Mostly it's clean and neutral smelling, but there is a bit of candle wax and peach to the nose as well. The palate is fresh and not too weighty, with melon, sweet apple and honeyed flavors. A solid wine, especially for the price range and origin. Don't expect miracles and it should be pleasing.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Ripe, healthy and pure, with familiar aromas and flavors of cassis and berries. In the mouth, it's bright and lively, with plenty of acidity but no sheering, harsh qualities. Finishes well, and as a whole it shouldn't raise any complaints while it may please value hunters and fans of Argentina.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A little jammy and heavy at first, but airing gives it better focus. The palate runs full and lush, with sweet tannins running alongside blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors. Holds it together on the finish, but overall the wine is more generic than individual.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Charcoal and ripe berry fruit announce this as a serious, masculine Malbec. The palate answers the bell, delivering tight blackberry and cassis flavors in front of a tannic, sturdy finish. Shows great foundation and potential; best in late 2007 into 2008.",Malbec
Argentina,"A joint venture between the Renacer winery of Argentina and Chile and Allegrini from the Veneto in Italy. Thus it makes sense that this five-grape blend is done in the Amarone style, with concentrated, dried grapes. Aromas are generous, minty and floral, and the palate is jammy and concentrated. Rich and a little raisiny, just like Amarone. Drink now.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Give this young Malbec some time to settle and it rounds into form. The nose goes from funky to finished in a few minutes, while the cherry and cola flavors run with ease toward a lightly tannic finish. Straightforward and likable once it finds its legs.",Malbec
Argentina,"Hailing from San Rafael in southern Mendoza, this wine—named after a shade-providing tree—is interesting and different from the masses. The nose is floral and herbal, with pencil eraser and red-fruit aromas, while the mouth is earthy and sort of Old World, with dry, lean tannins and structure.",Malbec
Argentina,"Soft and composed bouquet, with fruit aromas you will recognize and nothing funky or strained. The mouth is complete and better than ordinary, with pure but simple cassis, blueberry and plum fruit. A hint of oak allows for coffee and mocha to grace the modest finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Looks good in the glass, and with citrus essence, plum and cherry aromas, and spice notes it offers a controlled but pleasant bouquet. Cherry, plum and spice flavors work well with the wine's racy acidity and solid structure. Powerful and toasty on the finish.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Sweet, intriguing aromas of orange peel, spearmint and boysenberry jam give this individuality, while the flush palate serves up soft but ripe plum and berry flavors. Uncomplicated, with weight and adequate freshness.",Malbec
Argentina,"Here's one heck of a black, saturated wine. Cola and tar aromas abound, while the palate is borderline medicinal due to its extreme ripeness. If you like a rich, sun-drenched red with heft and body, this is it. The blend is 80% Malbec and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, and it hails from vines with up to 150 years of history behind them. Weighs in at a whopping 15.5%.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Chocolate and mint with the essence of coffee drives the bouquet. In the mouth, this Malbec-Merlot blend is ripe as can be, with cassis, blackberry and chocolate all making their mark. The finish is secure and mildly tannic, while the overall take is that this is a ribald, rich South American red.",Malbec-Merlot
Argentina,"This new wine from Donald Hess of the Hess Collection is a big, bold mix of black cherry and currants. It's ripe and cushioned by full tannins and a lot of spirit. The blend is 66% Malbec, 20% Cabernet and 14% Tannat from high-altitude vineyards in Salta. Will go nicely with steak and other meat dishes. A truly excellent, modern-styled Argentine red.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Ripe and smooth, with hints of molasses, toast, and vanilla as well as mulberry and blackberry. The wine runs sweet but masculine, with chocolate as the prime secondary flavor. Finishes long and broad, with supple tannins. Made from 8-year-old vines. Drink now through 2015.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sensational wine for the money. The Cab and Merlot work together seamlessly, as the nose exudes raspberry and sweet leather. Tastes warm and toasty, with ripe fruit softened by chocolate and pillowy tannins. Argentine red at its affordable best.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
Argentina,"Tight, concentrated and deep, with rubbery aromas of black fruit and earth. The palate is rich and layered, with lemony oak setting up herbal, powerful berry fruit flavors that come with hints of tea and briar. Zesty as well as rich, and well balanced. Nicely done for Salta Syrah.",Syrah
Argentina,"Heavily coated with coconut and oiled leather aromas, however, the palate recedes to Bonarda's typical angularity. The flavors of blackberry and cherry are solid, but the mouthfeel runs rough and sheer. And it finishes with some saltiness and leather. A good wine, not without its fault.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Minerally peach aromas keep things lean to start, and it's somewhat narrow in outlook throughout. The palate has melon, nectarine and papaya fruit, and there's both citrusy acid and custardy richness to give modest complexity. Like a green-fruit lollipop in liquid form.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Jammy and rubbery on the nose, but undeniably bold and friendly as well. The palate is what we'd describe as “happy,” meaning it's full, not too tannic and tasty. Flavors of cassis and ripe plum offer some fatness, and the finish is easygoing. Uncomplicated and good as a value wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark in color and that's backed up by deep earthy aromas and black fruit. In the mouth it's full and sweet, with baked fruit, chocolate and coffee flavors. Finishes with rich berry and molasses notes, and for a candied, sweet-styled Cabernet it gets the job done.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"After a few years of stumbling around in Mendoza, this Concha y Toro project seems to have found its way. This wine, albeit oaky, is full of dark fruit, dill and toast aromas. The palate is balanced and tight, with firm tannins and plenty of black cherry, plum and coffee flavors. Toasty and lasting. Shows a lot of power and purity.",Malbec
Argentina,"A typically huge Colomé wine with initial damp, murky, funky aromas that give way to earth, roasted fruit and compost. Fortunately it's fresher in the mouth, and the wine definitely improves with airing. Still, the palate is big and oily, with roasted berry, herb and wild, exotic flavors. A unique style of Malbec from old Calchaquí vines.",Malbec
Argentina,"Potent smelling, with black pepper, lots of oak and true berry fruit aromas. The palate is a bit pointed and high in acidity, while the flavors of raspberry, currants and red plum are solid. Finishes a little jagged and acidic, but at worst that staunch acidity will keep it alive for years to come. Hold until at least 2011.",Malbec
Argentina,"Black Label is a step up the quality ladder for Las Moras, based in San Juan. And this wine is full and chunky on the nose, with blackberry and plum-based aromas. In the mouth, it's more racy and oaky, teetering on sharp. But the freshness it boasts bodes well for pairing with meat, and the aforementioned oak lends a hint of cappuccino to an otherwise snappy finish.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Interesting enough on the nose, with aromas of cotton candy, charcoal, lemon peel and coffee. The palate deals the usual suspects for Cabernet: cassis, plum, tobacco and herbal accents. Competent as a whole and probably a bit above average.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Fruity but common on the nose, and acidic and sheering on the palate. No matter how many times you slide this across the palate, it seems tangy and electric. In the midst of all that zest there's bright plum and berry flavors followed by a lively finish. Tasty and cleansing, but choppy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Despite some initial sweet gummy aromas, things settle into form on the nose. In the mouth, raspberry and cherry flavors are almost in the bubblegum range but are more complex and true than candied. With freshness, nice tannins and decent structure, this wine is giving about all it can.",Malbec
Argentina,"Smells distinctly of cherry cola with a dash of lemon peel. The palate is medium-bodied at its richest, with red-fruit flavors of raspberry and cherry. As a whole it's colorful and easy to like, even if it finishes sort of thin but fresh. Good intentions; low on stuffing.",Malbec-Syrah
Argentina,"If you like a muscular, sweet, full-bodied wine with chunky wild berry flavors topped with a dollop of raisin and chocolate, this is it. It has lower acidity and therefore size and richness. For some it may be syrupy and less than exciting; others will enjoy its ripeness. Drink this year.",Syrah
Argentina,"Smooth and full of berry, marzipan and Christmas spice aromas. Comes on strong as it opens, revealing blueberry and black cherry flavors. Quite fresh and snappy, but with ample heft. A fine everyday red with guts.",Malbec
Argentina,"Jammy aromas of strawberry and raspberry are just solid enough to win you over, while the flavors of red fruit and cola carry a bit of tang and acidic bite. This is a fresh, lively everyday wine with sweet, standard flavors and a basic, competent mouthfeel.",Malbec
Argentina,"Full on the nose, but there seems to be some brett resulting in aromatic hints of hard cheese and leather. There's energy on the palate, with lemony notes preceding core flavors of cola, cassis and kirsch. Ripe and sweet, but with nothing out of the ordinary. Good Cabernet for the price, but not what you'd call interesting or exciting.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Saucy and sulfuric at first, but better with time. The palate amounts to a saturated fruit bomb with grip, while the core flavors of cassis and black fruits are very sweet and chunky. Bulky, broad and on the cusp of syrupy. Ripe and ready but maybe too ripe and creamy for its own good.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Some barrel influence works its way onto the largely natural bouquet, while the flavors of peach, banana and melon surf a smooth, modestly deep palate. This is better than your average Argentinean Chardonnay, especially if you like some tropical warmth and weight. Drink right away to catch its vitality.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Big and burly at 14.5% alcohol, with blueberry, blackberry, fudge and earth on the nose. Very ripe and heady, with sweet fruit flavors and a ton of oak. Nothing wrong whatsoever, but it locks into a place and doesn't budge. As a result, complexity is lacking.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pure and linear, without a spot of funk or wayward oak. The nose is beefed up with aromas of tar, smoke, leather and blackberry, yet the palate is a bit candied. Easygoing enough to rank as a very good everyday wine. And you'll never say “corchado” after opening it; it's sealed with a screw cap.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dark, robust and slightly medicinal, with a bouquet that's not run of the mill. The palate is juicy and jacked up on acidity, so we find live-wire cassis, berry and chocolate flavors that aren't quite as integrated as they should be. And it finishes slightly hot and sticky. Expensive for a wine that's all over the map.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"It's been many years since we've reviewed a Q Cabernet from Zuccardi, and this one is typically oaky, with plum, raisin, rubber, pepper and roasted fruit on the nose. The palate is tannic and firm, with meaty, grabby berry flavors offset by mocha, vanilla, caramel and other wood-driven flavors. Good wine but it comes with some bite and burn.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Large and ripe on the nose, with rubber, leather and rusticity. The palate is juicy and quick, with medium-weight tannins that frame lively cherry and blackberry flavors. Finishes earthy and dark, with length. A solid effort that should go well with steak and lamb skewers.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Septima's first crack at making a big wine leaves us intrigued but not thrilled. This is dark, meaty, saturated and most of all heavily oaked. It smells like coconut and veneer, while the rich, bulky palate is packed with resin, vanilla, cinnamon and blackberry. The blend is Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Tannat, and it could stand to be more refined and balanced than it is.",Red Blend
Argentina,"After starting out somewhat murky and muddled, it gets to better footing. The palate is thick and meaty, with sweet, semibaked fruit flavors and a handful of carob nibs. More carob and an herbal element work the finish, and overall the wine is good and substantive even if it doesn't stand out.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A very rich, sun-drenched style of Malbec that smells like a chocolate-and-fruit candy bar and tastes like ripe blackberry, raisin and pie filling. With a finish of licorice and pepper, this comes on as a dense, Porty Malbec with tons of fruit but questionable balance. Best for those who like their reds big and rich.",Malbec
Argentina,"A totally different breed of fox. The nose deals blueberry but also a thin, floral note that teeters on the edge of piercing. Almost crisp and prickly on the palate, with little of the heft and overt oak that so many premier Malbecs show. Racy stuff, but if you match it with food it might actually do better than some of the heavyweights.",Malbec
Argentina,"Starts out showing red-fruit aromas of currant, plum and raspberry. The palate stays the course, offering raspberry and strawberry flavors. Shows plenty of ripeness, moderate tannins and some buttery, vanilla-based oak. Fresh but simple. Drink now.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Mint and heat on the nose give way to baked dark-fruit aromas and earth. The palate is warm, structured and solid, with solid raspberry and plum flavors. Slightly creamy and candied on the finish, with coconut from the barrel and a final blast of heat. Not a wine for aging; drink now with food.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A fuller-bodied wine with round, cidery aromas and a whack of wood resin. The palate is spherical and honeyed, with apple, pineapple and nectarine flavors. For Argentinean Chardonnay it's well made and respectable, but at $20 it's not going to turn many heads.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Ample red plum and cassis both on the nose and palate makes this a proper Malbec wine. However, it's juicy and a bit acidic on the tongue, which makes the plum core a little shrill. Overall it's lively, mildly herbal, honest and gets the job done. Definitely falls into the fresh and snappy category.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dense, robust and a little jagged, with violet, graphite and blackberry aromas that stir interest. The palate is ultraripe, a touch saucy and thick, and full of black fruit and chocolate flavors. Short on the finish but a good carry over from the nose and palate. It sits on the cusp of being overdone but manages to hang in there.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cherry and plum-like aromas carry a dry, dusty edge and some stem, but as a whole this wine is light on its feet, easy to drink and proper. The flavors are quite red in scope, with a twinge of buttery oak adding softness. Licorice and another tick of wood take care of the finish. A fresh, forward wine for everyday use.",Malbec
Argentina,"Licorice, dark spice and berry pie right down to the buttery crust make for a decent nose. In the mouth, it's creamy and warm, with full-bodied plum and raisin flavors alongside a shot of acidity and chocolate on the finish. Not very complex but it delivers the basics.",Malbec
Argentina,"It doesn't take a great brain to figure out that this is a rocking, beautifully crafted international red wine. Mint, spice and chocolate aromas are dipped in lovely new oak, while the palate is all about bold plum backed by coffee and mocha. Stellar now and shows all signs of a wine that will only get better. Imported by Vias Imports.",Malbec
Argentina,"Leathery and reserved, with aromas of wet earth, black pepper, jalapeños and bell pepper. And while that may sound unripe to you, in the mouth the wine deals snappy red fruit and bona fide ripeness. Yes, it's a touch tight in terms of feel, but for a real taste of old-style South American wine, this is it.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Full-bodied and ripe, starting with the butterscotch and toast aromas and continuing on to the sweet-styled palate that offers pear, apple butter and walnut flavors. Thick more than lean, with one of the roundest and creamiest mouthfeels going. Imported by North American Beverage Group, LLC.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"The bouquet springs with red licorice, black cherry and blueberry, but also a hint of minty green. Not sharp but piquant on the tongue, with hints of cherry candy and grainy oak. Good on the surface but there's not a whole lot underneath. A solid quaff to match with burgers or pizza.",Malbec
Argentina,"A big step up from previous failures, this vintage shows tropical fruit aromas and some sea breeze. The flavors are of pineapple and tangerine, and the acidity is nice. On the finish, the fruit holds and the feel is right. Drink soon to capture the wine's perky freshness.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Lots of red-fruit aromas send it out in familiar fashion, while the palate runs a bit zesty and acidic. This is not as soft and rich as in the past; the flavors rest on bright plum and cherry fruit with plenty of acidic kick. Solid but regular as Malbec goes, and probably in need of food to give the acids something to work on.",Malbec
Argentina,"Opens with sweet berry aromas that are inviting yet generic. The palate has plenty of acidity, making this Merlot food-friendly but racy on its own. Flavors of black cherry and dark plums are juicy, and there's a touch of spice and chocolate late.",Merlot
Argentina,"Cherry and plum aromas carry the mildest touch of stem, yet the palate is reasonably stocky. Cherry and chocolate flavors may seem slightly confected, but given the wine's price it's hard to register many complaints. A creamy and flavorful finish makes this well worth the money.",Malbec
Argentina,"With solid peach aromas and an otherwise clean nose, this llama is worth the ride. Peach and honeydew flavors are sweet but not cloying or mucky, and there's even a hint of spicy white pepper to give the finish character.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Light, semisweet aromas of cherry show a modest level of concentration, while the palate is a bit rubbery and delivers good but regular cola and cassis flavors. There's a wave of milk chocolate to the fairly smooth but basic finish, and overall it's fine but doesn't get you excited. Only 250 cases made.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Sweet, candied and ever so slightly green on the nose, with generic but fairly solid cassis and berry flavors coming next. The feel leans toward gritty, while the finish is of moderate length and depth. Like a million other Cabs, but still o.k. for everyday drinking.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A gamy, slightly stemmy and rubbery style of Bonarda that reflects the variety, Mendoza's terroir and the vineyard. Which doesn't mean that it's great; far from it, the wine is good but stemmy, with green-ish notes and reedy accents infiltrating the red-fruit flavors that control the palate. Solid and structured, but still it leaves something to be desired.",Bonarda
Argentina,"The Oak Cask in the name is evident in the bacon, vanilla and creamy berry aromas that open things up. The palate, however, is fairly acidic, making the fruit taste bright and feel zesty. Flavors of cherry and plum are distinctly red in character, and the finish is quick and lean.",Syrah
Argentina,"A long with aromas of dried cheese, earth and rubber, there's enough clean black fruit to bring it home. The palate is snappy and fresh, with edgy, lively plum and berry flavors. The finish is short but offers some flashes of quality. Basic but solid Cab.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A big, sweet wine that doesn't have much teeth or bite but is friendly, rich and pleasing. The nose is all about berry fruit aromas and cassis, while the palate is equally gracious in terms of flavor but a little flabby and weak. Finishes with a kiss of chocolate bon bon but little structure or grip. Drink now.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
Argentina,"Sort of sweet and gaseous to start, with rubbery, medicinal aromas. The palate is tight and closed, with warm, crusty dark-fruit flavors, an herbal influence and heat. Thus the finish is a little fiery and peppery, and there's chop and bite to the overall feel. A kitchen-sink blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Syrah.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Starts out heavily smoked, almost woodsy. Stays oaky throughout, while showing an overt candied, sweet, medicinal core. Not very edgy, with a lot of marshmallow, vanilla and syrup. Made at twice the production level as the inaugural 2002, and with a new premium wine competing for top fruit; still good but not special like the '02.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Sweet and extracted, with medicinal aromas of kirsch meeting chocolate bon-bons. Carob, malted milk and raspberry liqueur are the dominant flavors, while the finish is spirited, i.e. grabby and aggressive. Best if you like yours saturated and big-boned.",Malbec
Argentina,"If it seems dilute and distant up front, the palate packs more punch. There's melon, pear and citrus rolled into an amorphous mish-mash, while the finish delivers mostly ripe melon. Runs a touch watery at the core, but with freshening acidity.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"This new wine comes courtesy of Bernard Portet (Clos du Val) and son, and for the most part it's on the money. The aromas are a touch horsey to start, and the red fruit is racy more than beefy. But it has a lot of flavor, full tannins and good balance. If aired out and served with meat or stew, it won't disappoint.",Malbec
Argentina,"Clean white wine, with white-fruit aromas and some prickle. The palate is linear and simple, with nectarine, citrus pith and tangerine-orange on the finish. A good, basic wine with one-dimensionality. Perfect for party time quaffing.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Opening aromas of cola and dark fruits are belied by the tangy, edgy palate that's fresh in terms of its raspberry and plum flavors but not all that deep or complex. A clean, straightforward wine with zest but limited flavors.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Mild, light aromas of apple, toast, mineral and petrol are solid before they evaporate, while the palate is easygoing and on target, with citrus and apple flavors. Without calling it overly exciting or complex, we like the mix of Chardonnay and Viognier because it's lively, fresh and perfectly drinkable.",Chardonnay-Viognier
Argentina,"Lively nectarine and citrus aromas give it early life, and the palate is equally zesty, with tangerine and pineapple flavors. This is good Sauvignon Blanc for Argentina, with plenty of citrus but not a lot of nuance or complexity.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Plump and sweet smelling, with bacon, wood smoke, sawdust and cotton candy aromas. The feel is jammy and the flavors of bacon-infused roasted fruit suggest some forced wood treatment. But overall the wine is satisfying, with pretty good mouthfeel. Approach it noncritically and it should do the trick.",Merlot
Argentina,"Lightly baked and sweet on the nose, which draws you in. The palate is brighter and more austere, with sheer, slightly bland cherry and raspberry flavors. Fresh, clean and bouncy on the finish, but never does it turn the corner toward greater complexity or quality. Good to average overall.",Malbec
Argentina,"A light, mildly stemmy and roasted Pinot with medium body and a solid mouthfeel. While not all that aromatic, the wine tastes of strawberry, raspberry and rhubarb, and there are accents of pepper and herbs along the way and on the finish. Shows good weight and color.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Ripe, pure and dense for a bargain-priced Malbec. The palate is a bit chunky and stolid, but the flavors of ripe berry, chocolate and beef stock ring true and the feel is clean and cushioned. A good but regular wine where the basics are covered.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pretty good and solid for an uncommon blend, but the Chardonnay and Pinot Grigio thrown together results in nice buttercup aromas along with some apple pie and pear. The palate runs sweet but maintains its freshness, and the flavors of apple, pear, melon and powdered sugar come together. A novelty wine that shows the right signs.",White Blend
Argentina,"This is one of three new single-vineyard Malbecs from venerable Trapiche, and it proves that with rich, old-vine fruit winemaker Daniel Pi can make ultramodern vino that will please New World palates the world over. This particular bottling is a potent brew of well-oaked juice that shows wintergreen, menthol and a ton of blackberry, black cherry and coffee. It isn't fooling around, that's for sure. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Malbec
Argentina,"Quite jumbled and big at 14.2% alcohol. This wine is cast in stone, it's so hard and tannic, even for Merlot. But under the bombarding tannic wall there's racy dark berry fruit. Ripped and hard, it badly needs meat to ease the tannins. By itself it's no joy ride.",Merlot
Argentina,"Aromas of roast plum and earth are a bit nutty and muddled, but overall this is a likable and slick wine with soft tannins and ripe candied-fruit flavors. With lushness and cola on the finish, it ends a bit syrupy and sweet. Good but not what you'd call refined or elevated.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Nice on the nose, with masculine, dense aromas of ripe berry fruits. The palate begins snappy and gets more sheering as the wine unfolds; in the meantime, the cherry, berry and plum flavors are more compact than candied. Well-done for Bonarda, but slightly narrow and grabbing the more you get to know it.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Opens with fairly deep blackberry aromas, but there's also a stemmy edge to the bouquet. Generic flavors of baked plum and berry are lifted by slicing acids, while the finish bounces along before ending with some straightforward chocolate and berry notes.",Malbec
Argentina,"Stemmy on the nose, with aromas of rhubarb, pie cherry and sucking candy. The palate is also candied, with a lean, fresh mouthfeel and floral, red-fruit flavors. Not a lot of darkness or concentration, but it does seem floral and refreshing. Shows some heat and scour on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Basic Torrontés aromas of citrus, greens and saline water greet you. The wine is light-framed and rings and zings on the palate. Lemon and green apple share the palate before lime rises up on the finish. A bit clanky but gets the job done when chilled down.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Tropical aromas of pineapple and melon are simple but clean, while the palate is fresh yet a little plump, with pineapple, mango, apple and banana flavors. This one will wet the whistle but it turns monotone on the finish. Drink as soon as possible for maximum vitality.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Yet another solid but unspectacular Malbec from Las Moras. The nose is rubbery and meaty, with leather and barnyardy brett notes. The palate is chunky and fleshy, with blackberry, stem and tobacco flavors. Good structure; mediocre aromas and flavor components.",Malbec
Argentina,"Neutral aromas of apple and peach kick it off, then round citrus and a mild hint of pickled vegetable and apple carry the palate. This is a fleshy, basic Chardonnay with youthful bounce and a touch of additional pickle on the finish. Drink soon.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Gold in color, with good texture. Somewhat short on intensity, however, with ample oak, almond, apple and pear flavors. Weighty but not terribly expressive. Appropriate acidity, good with salmon and the like. Imported by Ex-Cellars Wine Agencies, Inc.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Shows initial aromas of cherry and raspberry along with leather and raisin, but after some airing the bouquet dulls down and becomes murky. Lots of buttery, nonintegrated oak covers the red-fruit flavors and then dominates the finish. Ultimately that oak is the downfall.",Meritage
Argentina,"In recent years Michel Torino has been making better and better Malbec, and this vintage is the best we've tasted. It offers sweet fruit and marzipan on the nose, while the big, chewy palate is lush and packed with berries, vanilla and chocolate nesting on pillowy tannins. Very chummy and almost lavish. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Malbec
Argentina,"A big, roasted and fiery nose is act one, while act two offers a raisiny palate with black cherry and cassis flavors. This is a saturated, rough, gritty wine that's defined by baked, dark flavors and then coffee and roasted fruit on the finish. A hot-climate wine with integrity but marginal balance.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Starts with thick, raisiny aromas and later perfume and violets enter the scene. But in the mouth it's sort of thick and lumpy, with blackberry and cassis flavors but not much verve, tannin or acidity. Seems top-loaded, without much structure or finish to seal the deal.",Malbec
Argentina,"There's no escaping the wine's funky, leathery aromas that settle on moss and earth. Familiar plum and berry flavors have a touch of stem in the mix, while the finish is full, medicinal and anchored by mildly bitter tannins. Not bad but tastes and feels a little roasted and rough.",Syrah
Argentina,"Opens with light but earthy raspberry aromas and plum, and then it breaks up a bit with airing. The palate is lean but fresh and gritty, with cherry and cola flavors in front of a limited, narrow finish. Run-of-the-mill, which isn't bad given the price.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Yellow in color, with buttercup and citrus aromas. Not bad on the palate, where kiwi, melon and citrus flavors are fairly solid if unexciting. Where the wine completely fails to resemble Pinot Gris is on the scale; here it offers virtually no acidity and thus too much weight.",Pinot Gris
Argentina,"The second wine from Bodega Noemía de Patagonia is an unbridled winner in 2004. It's ripe and saturated, with a warm and spicy nose that blends just the right amount of rusticity with blackberry and plum. Quite a heavyweight with some raw oak, chocolate and mocha. Everything that fans of Argentine Malbec are looking for is on stage here. Imported by Vias Imports.",Malbec
Argentina,"Melon, peach and dusty aromas give the wine a solid but flat bouquet. With soft edges and modest citric acid, it's a little dull and disjointed as it stresses melon and apple flavors. As Argentine SBs go, this is expensive for what it offers.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"The Cabernets here, if you hadn't already guessed, are Sauvignon and Franc. There's a distinct herbal element to the nose, creating a “green” aromatic sensation. Meanwhile, the palate is coarse and on the acidic side, with red-fruit flavors accented by tarragon and oregano. Spicy but hot on the finish.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc
Argentina,"Browning in color, with mounds of dry spice, tea and earth aromas, but also a cooked, overoaked quality that doesn't serve the wine well. The palate is plodding and doesn't really evolve, while flavors of brown sugar, obvious oak and roasted berry seem to be fading. Expensive for what's in the bottle.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Powerfully oaked but awkward, with bruising aromas of fresh-cut wood, sawdust and campfire smoke. Amid the woodiness and thick body you'll find roasted plum and berry flavors, but on the finish resin reappears and lingers. Tastes too saucy and resiny to be called “clean.”",Red Blend
Argentina,"Orange peel, green fruits and then not much else make for a standard nose. The palate is full-sized and melony, and so is the plump, sweet finish. There's size, tropical fruit and green banana all over this wine, but not much spine or structure. Drink now.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Not very vivid in color, with aromas of rhubarb, raspberry and red licorice candy. The palate is a touch scratchy, with flavors of cassis and brown sugar but not a whole lot of true Cabernet character. The finish has a slight tannic bite, but overall this is generic red wine to the max.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Early sulfur and rotten-egg aromas are none too attractive, but in the mouth the wine is better. While sweet as sin, the soft, lush palate is a chocolate-lover's dream, and the finish is like mocha ice cream. Low acidity makes the structure sort of weak, but drink it now and that may not matter.",Malbec
Argentina,"Chunky and spicy on the nose, with mid-level plum and black-cherry flavors. More light than dark, with fleshy fruit that makes an o.k. impression before heading for the exit. Good but unexciting.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fairly round and solid, with citrus, nectarine and honey aromas. Tastes a bit more like orange juice than a fine white, but the mouthfeel and acid-fruit balance is acceptable. Best with simple Asian foods and salads.",Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon
Argentina,"Rather creamy and jammy to the nose, with flavors of cherry, plum and vanilla. Soft and fleshy, and a bit short on zest. Good enough with no overt faults; it's just a bit flat and lazy.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fully oaked, so the nose deals plenty of coffee and maple. Under that there's vibrant red-cherry and cassis flavors amid firm tannins. The finish is solid and spicy, with chocolate folded in. Although it is a bit gritty and hard now, each additional month you hold it the hardness will dissipate. Made of 70% Malbec and 30% Bonarda.  Imported by 57 Main Street Wine Co.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Strawberry, cherry and other red-fruits comprise a thin-styled bouquet, and pretty much the rest of the show follows suit. The palate is of medium weight, without much heft or structure. Flavors of red fruits are lean.",Merlot
Argentina,"Smells like apple blossom and saline solution, and the wet, fresh palate tastes of pineapple and mango. It's a modest Chard in every way, with medium concentration and nectarine and pickle on the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Floral, young and jumpy smelling, with gumball aromas that leave you with the impression that the wine's clarity, balance and purity may be tenuous. The palate is raw but fresh, with simple but snappy wild berry flavors. Not a lot of structure or depth here.",Malbec
Argentina,"In an attempt to ramp things up, Rutini has a wine that's loaded with candied black fruit, tire rubber and a distinct green streak. The palate is all blueberry and sweetness, but it's short, green and terribly basic. And the feel and finish are narrow and scratchy, respectively. Not one of Rutini's better efforts.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This wine from Finca Sophenia is tiring and should be drunk immediately. In the meantime, there are cornflake and wheat bread aromas in front of a creamy palate marked by honey and flan. Warm, doughy and losing form.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Not much in the way of aromas, with tangerine and mango flavors. Finishes short, but fruity enough, with lasting flavors of pineapple and orange. From Bodegas Salentein.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Blunt and clumsy, with a slight vegetal streak to the chunky nose. The flavor profile is sweet and candied, while the finish hits with a wave of applesauce and peach flavors. Hangs rather heavily on the palate.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Among the new crop of Patagonian Malbecs, this wine shows a sly style. It's not that full of bells and whistles but it does offer plenty of ripe red fruit such as cassis, cherry and strawberry. Blended in are touches of tobacco and leather. Goes down smooth and easy; registers more lush and ripe than anything. Imported by S&F; Trading Company.",Malbec
Argentina,"It doesn't take a genius to realize that this is a very nicely made, fully healthy Shiraz. The bouquet is just right, with smoky nuances to the full-fledged dark fruit aromas. The palate is racy and juicy, but plush with black berry and plum. And the balance is right on. Smells good, tastes good and feels good.",Shiraz
Argentina,"A bit foxy and stemmy on the nose, with hints of orange that make things seem nervy and stretched. The palate is clumsy and a little tart in flavor, with herbs and zest leading to a wavy but unique finish. Walks to the beat of its own drummer; uncommon for Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"This Reserve holdover from '05 is '0 well-oaked, so there are clear-cut coffee and mocha aromas to go with adequate fruit scents. But the forceful oak leaves a lemony, hammering flavor on top of simple cherry fruit. With some oil and shoe polish on the finish, this wine doesn't impress.",Malbec
Argentina,"Quiet aromas of peach lead to sweet, basic flavors of nectarine and white table grapes. The finish is fleshy and pithy, with some heat and bitterness settling in after initial sugary sweetness. Drink immediately.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Deep purple in color, and soupy on the nose, with a strong hint of lemon. The palate is almost astringent due to elevated acidity, thus the balance of this Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon-Bonarda blend is sketchy. Tastes more like grape juice than fine wine, with a hollow, tangy finish.",Red Blend
Argentina,"The nose is full of dust, cotton candy, peach pit and banana, while the palate is sugary and tastes like honeydew melon and pear. Fleshy and bland on the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Purple in color and smells like sweet fruit, citrus peel and powdered drink mix. Round in the mouth, with generic plum and berry flavors that don't taste all that much like classic Pinot Noir. A simple, bulky wine that's young and probably not going very far.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Earthy and showing clay, milk chocolate, baked cherry and mocha aromas and flavors, and while the wine feels fairly smooth it doesn't do much but lay there on the palate. Kind of heavy, amorphous and seemingly fading, and overall it's a junior version of Salentein's dying Primum Pinot from 2004.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Gaseous and scrambled at first, with leathery aromas that mask the fruit component. Better later on, although it remains sulfuric and leathery, with confused cherry and raspberry flavors. Not much grace or precision, but not an overtly poor wine either.",Malbec
Argentina,"Waxy, lemony and sort of acrid on the nose, and that's followed by fleshy citrus and baked corn flavors. Along the way there are waves of sugary sweetness and pithy bitterness.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Smells like black cherry Kool-Aid, so don't be surprised that it tastes snappy and angular, with flavors of cherry and raspberry. Crisp and lean all the way through, with some grit and scour to the finish. Not much stuffing or size, but generous with the candied flavor.",Malbec
Argentina,"Red-fruit aromas carry a distinct citric edge, while the palate is made up of sweet cassis and cherry flavors along with an incongruent orange essence. The feel is a bit hard and pedestrian, while the finish is quick and ordinary at best.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Aromas of buttercup and sweet pear are acceptable but cheesy, while the palate is wet, vapid and shows nothing but anonymous white-fruit flavors. The finish is dry, hollow and mildly buttery.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Hints of wisteria and lemon blossom give this dilute Chardonnay a respectable bouquet, while the palate is mild and tastes like bites of lemon, apple and orange. There's not much weight or stuffing to it, but it's generally clean and inoffensive.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Fresh like a peach on the nose, with a bit of warm radiator dust. Flavors of lemon and green apple are narrow, and the mouthfeel is limited and indicates that the lifespan of the wine may be short. Citric on the finish, and overall there's just not a lot going on here.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Licorice and char on the nose hint at size and ripeness, but the palate does not deliver. Tart raspberry and red-plum flavors are sweet for a fleeting moment and then decidedly sour, while the finish is bland. Shows a few positives but overall it's too snappy and sharp for Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Spunky and upright, with herbal red fruit on the nose and short, staccato flavors of rhubarb and pie cherry. Finishes tangy and hard, with a slight bitterness.",Merlot
Argentina,"Standard jammy fruit sets the stage for moderate black cherry and plum flavors. Seems hard on the palate, with jagged tannins that will drill away if left unwashed. Fairly flavorful, but lacking in charm.",Merlot
Argentina,"Smells hot but neutral, with meek flavors of citrus and pineapple. Lots of vibrant acidity creates a scouring mouthfeel, but what is there to say about the bland flavors of soda crackers and citrus pith?",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Artificially jammy and sweet, with medicinal cherry aromas and flavors. Fairly hard, with gritty tannins. More of an effort than it should be.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Impressive and saturated, with ripe aromas. The mouth is focused and, generally speaking, quite rewarding. The blackberry and dark plum flavors are big and aggressive. If there's any one place the wine doesn't wow, it's on the finish, which is short and a bit sharp-edged. Needs food. Imported by Billington Imports.",Malbec
Argentina,"Starts out dense, with aromas of fruit cake, prune and hard cheese, but time allows it to show its sweet side, where currant, blackberry and sautéed mushroom carry the palate to a forward, likable finish. Made in a fresh but sizable style; it's not syrupy yet it packs power.",Malbec
Argentina,"Saturated and extracted, with an incredibly deep purple tint paving the way for manly aromas of espresso, campfire and toasted coconut. The palate, meanwhile, runs a bit sweet, with boysenberry and plum. Soft on the back end, but with enough spine to see it through. For fans of bold reds.",Malbec
Argentina,"Made from Catena's Adrianna Vineyard, this bulky reserve-level wine deals mature aromas of corn, wheat and melon more than anything zingy or zesty. The full-bodied palate is ripe and meaty, with chunky cantaloupe and peach flavors. Warm and oaky on the back end, if maybe a little too heavy. Drink now.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Dull passion fruit is about the best you get from the bouquet, while the palate is weak and watery, with light tropical fruit flavors. Finishes with banana notes.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Tobacco, sugar beet and cough drop aromas don't offer much, while blatant wood resin on the palate is wrapped tightly around blowsy blackberry fruit. Tough and tannic.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A strange wine with heavy, overripe aromas of burnt grass and melon. No real fruit to hang your hat on, and nothing much in the way of nuance, feel or finish. Made by Luigi Bosca.",Viognier
Argentina,"Piercing aromas of bulky fruit and horseradish are tough to handle, and underneath there's little to no redeeming sweetness. Menacing in its tannic profile.",Merlot
Argentina,"Rubbery and jammy, with condensed aromas of cough drops and cherry sucking candy. Finishes astringent and cloying.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Starts with sweaty leather and peanut aromas before moving on to linear, sour flavors. Pure acid on the finish does nothing to make it chummier.",Merlot
Argentina,"Yet again this relatively affordable wine shows the charms and potential of Argentinean Malbec. It has a beautiful color and full, fruity aromas. The palate runs a bit snappy and upright, with cherry-based fruit that will go great with any type of grilled or braised meat. Clean, ripe and tasty, with the slightest bit of perky acids. Imported by Billington Imports.",Malbec
Argentina,"Very forward and correct, with a bit of piquant snap to the nose. That same perky quality carries over to the palate, where some coffee character darkens blackberry fruit. Racy and solid, and on the money.",Syrah
Argentina,"Hailing from high-altitude Tupungato, this dense but fresh Malbec issues good plum, berry and earth aromas along with some smokiness and tree bark. It's fairly rich and full across the tongue, showing blackberry, blueberry and chocolate. Finishes warm and spicy, with good girth and weight.",Malbec
Argentina,"Full and toasty, with an overt, burnt, almost charred nose. Mineral, charcoal and red plum carry the zesty palate to an open, tasty, long finish. Closing notes of espresso, tree bark and bitter chocolate are obvious and appropriate.",Malbec
Argentina,"Jammy and saturated, with ripe plum, berry and tar aromas. It's fairly sweet and hedonistic in the mouth, but with enough pulsing acidity to keep things in balance. Smoky, racy and juicy on the back palate; this is one of the better Salentein wines we've tried lately.",Syrah
Argentina,"Purple to the eye, with intense aromas of mint, licorice and saturated black fruit. The mouth is like blueberry-blackberry compote, while the oak seems heavy given the wine's higher acids and limited depth. Has plenty of positives but sings just one note.",Malbec
Argentina,"Intriguingly herbal, with spice, leather and oregano aromas as opposed to Malbec's more common jammy blueberry and blackberry characteristics. The palate is moderately juicy, with hints of pepper, baking spices and earth. Different than the pack, which is admirable.",Malbec
Argentina,"Heavily extracted, with roasted aromas of charred wood, beef and coconut. The mouth pushes bold cherry, blackberry and plum flavors, while the finish is slick yet tangy. This wine shows bulk around the edges but is leaner and more acidic in its center.  Solid for everyday action, assuming you like yours big.",Malbec
Argentina,"Reddish in color, which announces that it's Malbec. The nose is sizable but fresh, with riper, sweeter aromas. A bit more zesty in the mouth than you might expect, with an expansive, almost Beaujolais-like finish. Well balanced; a good pink wine. Imported by Tastings Import Company.",Malbec
Argentina,"Concha y Toro's Argentinean branch makes this heavyweight wine, which goes heavy on the oak, toast and horseradish. It's opaque in color, with monster tannins backing plum and blackberry fruit. Finishes hot, peppery and short, but with a lot of texture.",Malbec
Argentina,"Perfect color combined with one of the more atypical but interesting bouquets you'll find stirs intrigue. Aromas of mint, berry syrup and most of all clove are intense, while the black licorice and espresso accents on the palate work. Not Spanish in style nor is it reserved. This is a bruising wine with a unique Mendoza identity.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Black in color, with the full allotment of earth, leather and black-fruit aromas. Fairly tight on the palate, with flavors of black cherry, cough syrup and espresso. Finishes stark but nice; good but just short of the big leagues.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"A bit rubbery and raw, but with a hearty backbone. The nose deals plum and black cherry along with some smoky wet leather, while the palate is grapey with a touch of blueberry. Finishes clean and simple.",Shiraz
Argentina,"This is what full-force, high-elevation Malbec is all about. The color is opaque, the nose a potent brew of herbal mint, blackberry and earth. With layers of warmth and depth on the finish, this wine represents the bigger is better school of thought.",Malbec
Argentina,"A defined, balanced, artistic rendition of Malbec. Cola and hard spices mix with leather and sweet marshmallow on the bouquet, then it dishes berry pie, coffee and mocha flavors. Plenty of charcoal and chocolate create a sturdy but delectable finish. An excellent Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Somewhat complex, as it begins with heavy bacon and tire rubber aromas that ultimately give way to more floral notes. Fairly thick on the palate, with sweet red fruits, glycerol and tannins. Finishes a touch flat and sugary, with some Port-like heat. A hard one to peg.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Quite full and plump, with oily aromas along with hints of wood resin and nectarine. More citrus than expected on the tongue, primarily overripe white grapefruit. Somewhat low-acid on the finish, but good overall.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Ripe and a bit prickly on the nose, but it's way more sturdy than dirty. Flavors of apple, lemon and orange peel are fine, while the fresh finish is bittered up a bit by citrus pith",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Big and rubbery, with an extreme oaky nose. The unconventional blend is Malbec, Petit Verdot and Tannat, and it focuses mostly on red fruits like rhubarb and plum. Slightly tannic and hot, but also inspired and properly made.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Gorgeous aromas of pipe tobacco, mint and sweet oak create a full, meaty bouquet when combined with the blasting fruit that's on display. Flavors of blackberry and plum are ripe and refined, while the tannins grab but don't slam at your palate. Textured and chocolaty, with ample freshness. A winner.",Malbec
Argentina,"Good as it is on its own, Malbec only gets better when blended with Cabernet, as it is here, in a 2:1 proportion. This wine explodes with spice and tight, tart fruit. Berries, currants and cherries highlight the full, round mid-palate, leading confidently into a finish folded in cocoa and toast. Clean, elegant and stylish, it carries none of the mushroom or funk flavors that often come with inexpensive Argentine reds. Part of the Escorihuela Group, who also make the One Bunch and Gascón wines.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"Boasting plum, bitter chocolate and some earth, this is a fairly full Malbec, but not one that shows off the best this winery can do. For that, wait for the 2002 and '03 vintages, which are measurably better. Here, however, there's bulky fruit, coffee notes and some woody spice that are more than acceptable.",Malbec
Argentina,"Clean and medium weight, with simple red-fruit and cherry-cola aromas. Forward plum and berry carry the palate, which spreads out with no frills over the finish. Somewhat smoky and burnt on the aftertaste, but still pretty good mainstream stuff.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Deep mocha and coffee greet you on the nose, backed by intense fruit and lavender aromas. And in between you catch some perfume and lilac. Rich and creamy in the mouth, with a full allotment of berry fruits, including blueberry and blackberry. Finishes a bit oaky and short, but that's a small complaint.",Malbec
Argentina,"Lauded Chilean winemaker Aurelio Montes traveled across the Andes to make this wine, just like the Kaiken bird does when it migrates. It's quite stunning, especially given the price. Look for black plum, licorice, cassis, earth and coffee aromas and flavors. The bitter chocolate finish is dynamite in terms of tannic structure and length.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"What a score! Torrontès, a little-known Spanish white winegrape, turns out to be a superstar in Mendoza. Packed tight with bright, vivid, penetrating fruit, this strikingly flavorful wine begins with lovely scents of citrus, orange peel and tangerine and takes off from there. It moves into still more complexity, with traces of diesel, talc and flower petal. Think Viognier, Gewürztraminer and Riesling, blended and punched up with a full-bodied, lingering finish.",Torrontés
Argentina,"As good as it gets from Argentina. Winemaker Jorge Riccitelli has artfully crafted a bruising but lovable modern Bordeaux blend that hits every note on the head. The nose offers black olive, berry essence and a ton of chocolate, while the tannic but balanced palate sports luscious black cherry, cassis and more. For a stud of a wine, it has nuance and character—meaning it's not just a fat fruitball. At 70% Malbec with Merlot and Cabernet, this is the ideal wine for a great steak. Just 250 cases produced.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"From cooler Tupungato, this blend seems marinated on the nose, with rubbery accents to the dark fruit. The bulky palate spills over with raspberry and plum, while the finish is mildly acidic. Nonetheless it's a full-force red with plenty of fuel in the tank.",Malbec-Syrah
Argentina,"Although this isn't overly stuffed, it manages to handle the spicy wood that was thrown at it during aging. With cinnamon and foresty accents, the fruit comes across light and distant. Still, the wine finishes clean and proper, so it should do well with basic foods.",Malbec
Argentina,"Clean, simple and unadulterated, with a pleasant roundness and pure, ripe fruit. The flavors veer toward green apple, citrus and pineapple, while the finish is warm and clean. An easy, satisfying wine.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Sweet and mature, with earth, plum and raspberry aromas and flavors. A mainstream read with little texture or complexity, but it goes down well with a medium body and no overt flaws. For everyday consumption.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Full and wholesome on the nose, with blackberry, cherry and smoke aromas. Tastes good as a full package, with a pure finish. A rock-solid wine, clearly the best in the Tango line.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Winemaker Silvio Alberto, working with consultant Michel Rolland, is clearly a proponent of the bigger-is-better school, and he deserves credit for making big wines that are balanced despite being brawny. This high-end Malbec, which is very reasonably priced, blasts with menthol, prune, chocolate and cassis. It's modern and chewy, but has enough tannin, acid and grit to keep it in fine form. Drink now through 2008. Imported by Kysela Pere et Fils.",Malbec
Argentina,"Frenchman Bernard Magrez is building a global brand via high-quality, smartly named wines such as this (La Bienvenida means The Welcoming in Spanish). But the cuteness ends there; this is serious Malbec with maple, leather and coffee aromas in addition to rich berry scents. The palate is integrated and deep, with lively acidity and tannins but enough cuddly fruit to ensure balance. An excellent Argentinean debut for Monsieur Magrez. Imported by Bernard Magrez USA.",Malbec
Argentina,"Ruby in color, and light almost to the point of transparency. Flavors of cherry and toast define the palate, while the finish is a bit raw. Otherwise, it's a pleasing enough wine because of simple oak-driven raspberry flavors.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big and barrel heavy, with burnt aromas dominating the nose. Underneath is sweet black-cherry fruit, although it's so rich and forward that it risks being considered medicinal. Some heavy wood creates a chocolaty flavor and feel.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cafayete is not Mendoza, nor does this wine taste like a Mendoza wine. It's aromatic and racy, with sharp acids and a piercing mouthfeel. Sour cherry and cassis flavors dominate, while a hint of enrichening blueberry sweetens things up.",Malbec
Argentina,"The earthy plum aromas seem common, as if you've been there before. Flavors of plum, berry and rhubarb, however, are fresh and zesty. Good on the palate and healthy, with decent tannins and some chocolate to the finish.",Shiraz
Argentina,"For a five-spot you get syrupy but fairly deep red fruit in the cherry, raspberry and plum category. The mouthfeeel is more than acceptable, while the overriding jammy sweetness could muster mass appeal.",Merlot-Malbec
Argentina,"Slightly sharp but snappy enough to keep you interested. Flavors of red apple, raspberry and plum control the palate, while moderately hard tannins on the finish seem to stretch and thin the wine.",Malbec
Argentina,"A little old by now, but the smooth, light aromas convey additional life and freshness. The palate mixes citrus and apple, while there's some white-pepper spice on the finish. Fairly full, but low-acid.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"The bouquet is downright saucy, with molasses, brown sugar and leather aromas. Standard plum and berry make for an average palate, while modest coffee and spice carry the finish. Generally good, but fails to make an impression.",Merlot
Argentina,"A little oily and heavy, but the buttercup and candle wax aromas seem more real than artificial. The palate is plump, a bit sugary, but the apple and orange notes are clear. Finishes juicy enough and not overly cloying.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"From the Maipu subsection of Mendoza, this one runs on the heavy side, with plum and berry aromas, a chewy mouthfeel, and lots of sugar on the finish. Lacks finesse but delivers plenty of flavor along the way.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Jammy, sweet aromas conjure notes of a rose garden in bloom, but the palate is more scattered. On offer is basic cherry, raisin and cotton candy. Sweet on the finish, yet good in a simple way.",Malbec
Argentina,"Clean and flush throughout, with baked-fruit, chocolate and earth aromas. Very big on the palate, but soft and chewy. Finishing notes of coffee along with wide tannins create a lasting, long impression. Fine for the price.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Aromas of campfire, baked fruit, black licorice and cherry create a pleasant bouquet. The cherry and cassis fruit that flows on the palate is juicy and live-wire. Finishes with coffee, chocolate and black pepper. Full and forward, with a dark personality.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Very big and brawny is this single-vineyard, new-to-the-market Malbec from grower Jose Blanco. Expect lots of fresh-cut cinnamon on the nose along with leather, earth and gum. Heavy but balanced, with big tannins wrapped in plenty of coconut and mint. Takes a while to grasp; it's a giant with huge fruit and some clumsiness. Better from 2007–2009. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Malbec
Argentina,"Is there a better, more consistent Malbec on the market today than Punto Final? The 2005 is typically rich and dense, with saturated berry aromas and a strong but balanced oak element. The palate is a potpourri of berries, chocolate and vanilla, while the mouthfeel is juicy and stacked. Quite delicious; this is the type of wine that gives Argentine Malbec its good name.",Malbec
Argentina,"Purple as can be, with a loaded bouquet of black fruit and oak. This is your classic heavyweight, and while 2004 was not a great vintage in Mendoza, this wine still shows excellent depth, weight and balance. Firm on the finish, with big tannins and grab. Production was only 175 cases; drink now–2009. Imported by Southern Wine Group.",Malbec
Argentina,"Better flavors than aromas. The nose begins gassy and burnt, and it never quite sheds that harsh barrel smell. But in the mouth, it has sweet, chunky fruit and a pleasant softness. Our bet is that if given time to properly open, folks will like it because of its easiness.",Malbec
Argentina,"The nose consists of berry jam, wintergreen and burnt popcorn. Angular and lean, with flavors of pie cherries, tomato and peppers; in some ways it has similar flavors to a mild salsa. A clean finish with some body is the high point.",Malbec
Argentina,"Muscular, chunky and a bit sun-baked. The nose is smothered by sweaty leather and barnyard, while a bit of everything is accounted for on the palate: red berries, jamminess, even red cabbage. In the final analysis, it's got force but it's not focused or harnessed.",Malbec
Argentina,"At first you almost have to laugh at the name. Would the Spanish call one of theirs “Bullfight?” That said, the wine itself isn't bad. It's a bit heavy, forceful and unrefined. What hinders it is a rubbery mouthfeel and a mild burn to the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Michel Rolland consults on this Chard from Tupungato, which shows powdered sugar, apple and pineapple on the nose. A bit confusing to the taste, with olive oil and white pepper supporting distant flavors of papaya and green melon. Round but short on the finish.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Jammy, sweet and leathery on the nose, with a kick of sourness. The palate is common, with medium red fruit that's strawberry-raspberry in style. Adequate on the palate, and generally satisfying.",Malbec
Argentina,"Somewhat heavy and overripe, with plum and earth aromas. The palate carries a heavy, weighty feel, with rather murky flavors. Rubbery tannins create a stick-to-the-cheeks sensation. Seems like the winemaking effort was here but maybe not the grapes.",Merlot
Argentina,"Generally gimmicky names draw no applause from these parts, but here we like this wine's raspberry, graham cracker and orange-peel nose along with its crystallized raspberry and strawberry flavors. It's slightly gritty and sugary, but overall it's still fresh enough to handle the sweetness.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Lots of wood, camphor and decaying vegetables on the nose made this wine hard to like from the get-go. Mouthfeel is lean (some said thin), with tart berry fruit, musty cedar and white pepper flavors. There isn't much of a finish, but what's there is pretty woody.",Syrah
Argentina,"Anyone looking for a whole lot of wine for not too much cash will be pleased with this blend, named for former Argentinean president Juan Perón, husband of Evita. Back to the wine: it's rich, heady and borderline opulent, with ripe tannins, plumpness and hedonistic fruit. Incorporates 10% Cabernet and 5% Syrah. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Malbec
Argentina,"From the beginning you can tell that this Bordeaux-style blend has the requisite components to make the grade. The bouquet offers baking spices, berry and vanilla in large doses, while the palate is ample, fresh and fairly racy. Nothing dull or clumsy here; it's a balanced, structured wine with aging ability. Drink now or hold through 2009. Imported by Kysela Père et Fils.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Pitch dark in color, with a huge, oaky/earthy nose that cuddles deep black-plum fruit. Ultraripe and modern in style, with mounds of plum and blackberry flavors. Toasty and minty on the round finish. This is one rich wine; a massive improvement over the 2000 vintage, the last Altimus we rated. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Attractive and well put together from start to finish. This Cab (with 15% Malbec) is jammed with cassis, raspberry and other juicy berry flavors, while the lushness of the wine rolls over your palate with ease. It's not easy to find Cabernet this good in the $20 range, so get after this one while it's under the radar.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Nothing is hidden in this bruising, forward Cab. The nose is oaky as can be, but also endowed with intense black fruit. The palate might register as soft to some, but there's still a tannic foundation that bolsters blackberry, spice cake and molasses flavors. Not super long on the finish but intense in a lumbering sort of way. Drink now–2011.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This is a delicious and somewhat rare style of Malbec: it has none of the usual oak. What you wind up with is fruity, clean and pure. The body is maybe a touch leaner without the oak; the flavor profile is brighter and more linear.",Malbec
Argentina,"Regal and ready, and showing equal amounts of early maturity along with youthful fruit and menthol aromas. The palate is saturated with raspberry and black cherry, while the lengthy finish offers coffee and chocolate. Drive and power are not in short supply, so take this one with fatty foods like ribs or steak.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rusty in color, especially for the normally dark Malbec. Some mint and licorice aromas lead it off, followed by malty oak. Rather lean and dry across the palate, with more acids than flesh.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is meant to be a special selection from the Tulum Valley, but it's rather thick, tarry and candied. A sugary palate the consistency of berry syrup is the vehicle for this oaky, black-fruit heavyweight that is sweet beyond what it should be.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cheesy aromas kick start it, and the wine never really recovers. It's pungent, sharp and angular, with some weedy flavors that intermingle with a blanket of oak. Decent in the mouth, as it gets a bit better with airing.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fairly overripe, with jammy aromas touched by raspberry and mocha. Somewhat lactic on the palate, with strawberry and other berry notes. Finishes flat although it never offends.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Ripe and heavy on the nose, with hints of stewed plum, berries and chocolate. More chunky prune and plum follows in the mouth. Entirely drinkable but not refined.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fruity and floral on the nose, which is by far the wine's high point. The palate, however, is too acidic to handle the weight of the fruit, which isn't much. In the end, the wine's racy and intense, offering more on the nose than in the mouth.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rustic berry and leather on the nose is backed up by modest cherry and plum flavors. A touch gritty and hot on the finish, with slight tomato and leather notes.",Syrah
Argentina,"Smells fine, with flowers and mixed stone fruits. The palate is thin but sweet, with ripe apple and mango flavors. As might be expected from a value Chard, the finish is syrupy and a touch hot, but not offensively so.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Quite flowery and round, with pure grape, cherry and berry aromas and flavors. Very fresh and spunky, and well made. Finishes with lots of fruit, integrated oak and hints of coffee and chocolate.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"Dark purple in color, with equally dark aromas of black fruit, road tar and mustard greens. The mouth is balanced and rich, dealing jammy blueberry and black cherry along with a serving of melted fudge. What Malbec from Argentina should be.",Malbec
Argentina,"This Cab-Malbec mix starts with sweet, syrupy aromas that grow more masculine with airing, with violet and rose petal scents along with some oak-driven caramel. The palate is round and sizable, with chocolate and plum flavors. Finishes meaty and chunky. From a newer winery owned by Codorníu of Spain.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"Rich, warm and possessing a ton of dry oak, this is one serious Argentine Cabernet. The palate is grippy as a rubber glove, with snappy berry flavors and pointed acidity. It's ripe, racy and edgy, with substance to the fruit, feel and finish. Drink now through 2010.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Here's another success from Bodega Norton. The nose is rich and big, with crusty chocolate and coconut aromas. More chocolate blends with blackberry and pepper in the mouth, while on the finish there's sexy layered darkness. It's New World pomp and pleasantness in all its glory.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This wine needs time to get its legs underneath it. It comes on young and rugged and gamy, but if you let it sit and air out for 20 minutes it turns deeper, riper and much more fruity. And by the time it settles you're smack dab in the middle of mountain berry and other natural flavors. Will get better with some bottle time.",Malbec
Argentina,"Raw and lacking in concentration, this wine delivers pedestrian fruit with a lactic, buttery consistency. Finishes sweet but sort of gritty, and slightly medicinal.",Malbec
Argentina,"Rusty in color, with “country” aromas of sweaty leather, horsehide and hay. Ponderous on the palate, with sour plum and murky baked fruit. Surely not a disaster but brings with it some heavy overriding characteristics.",Merlot
Argentina,"This 50/50 blend features apple skin, cherry and other berry aromas and flavors, all wrapped in a coating of hard candy. The finish is like a sucking lozenge and the mouthfeel is rock hard.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
Argentina,"This is La Rural's top line, and before we've been a fan of the Malbec. But this wine has serious balance issues; it's acidic and sour at the core, with heavy oak and not enough flesh. Hails from the cooler Tupungato region, something that's evident in the wine's thin structure.",Merlot
Argentina,"Sharp and sour, with cherry, sucking candy and scouring acidity. Not poor but rather harsh on the palate.",Merlot
Argentina,"Candied and sweet on the nose, but sour on the tongue. Simply put, it's astringent, lean and acidic, all common traits of this hard-to-master grape more frequently found in Uruguay.",Tannat
Argentina,"Violet in color, with pickled aromas marring black plum. Flavors of red cabbage and plum are tart, and the mouthfeel is that of a citrus-based juice. From the more eastern district of San Juan.",Malbec
Argentina,"Funky on the nose, with aromas of cream cheese, green bean and red fruit. Beets and cherries carry the palate to a cloying, immensely sugary palate. Struggles as Cabernet.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Seems like time forgot this Cabernet-Merlot-Malbec trio, and now it's unstable. The nose is pure barnyard, with hints of peanut and saddle. The palate is cooked and tired. Not horrible but still best to skip.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Raisiny and fat, not exactly the most welcoming notes. Tastes overripe and sugary, with a finish too much like sherry.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"The earthy nose offers leather and red fruit, but it's far short of overdone. Raspberry and cherry flavors dominate, while the lighter-weight palate is racy but not that plump in the middle. A good wine that improves with airing.",Malbec
Argentina,"Starts a little sour, pickled and funky, but airing lets it find its legs and shine. Plum and snappy berry fruit is a touch tart, but not too much so. With time, it fattens up, displaying charcoal, coffee and chocolate on the finish.",Malbec
Argentina,"Cotton candy and flower-petal aromas are a bit sweet and youthful, but the nose is no turn off. Flavors of berry and molasses convey some thickness, while the finish is equally creamy and thick. Spicy and full of fruit.",Malbec
Argentina,"The polar opposite of boring, this lovely blend offers aromas of mint, herbs, flower petals and sandalwood. The palate, meanwhile, is all about pure, robust blackberry and plum. It's a chunky, rich wine with a bit of burnt toast on the lusty finish. Thorough and textured. A bona fide winner. Imported by Billington Imports.",Malbec-Merlot
Argentina,"After an earthy, aggressive, almost sweaty start, this joint-venture red from Nicolas Catena and Eric de Rothschild finds its course and manages to improve. The palate is full of acid-driven, amplified cherry and plum flavors, and while there's a hint of buttery oak resting on the finish, that should subside with airing and a good food pairing. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"If you don't mind a little overt wood on your Malbec, then this will certainly do the trick and more. The nose offers some maple and mature berry aromas, while the palate pumps oak-infused black cherry fruit. Lengthy on the finish, with mocha and vanilla. Like we said, it's a bit toasty and woody, but overall it works like a charm.",Malbec
Argentina,"Few Argentinean wineries are doing everyday red wines better than Chakana. A case in point is this excellent, superbly balanced, easy-drinking Cab. The nose is meaty, earthy and magnetic, while the palate is ripe, harmonious and full of cassis and raspberry. It's fruity more than complex, with stature and style.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Color, power, flavor and commendable balance; that's pretty much the format for Punto Final, one of Argentina's go-to brands for Malbec. This youngster is ripe and ready, and it holds form onto a long finish. If it seems a little young and clumsy upon pouring, air it out and it'll improve.",Malbec
Argentina,"Dense and dark, with a color akin to purple ink. Catchy, well-made, the fruit is ripe and abnormally friendly, while the structure is solid. What makes this an above-average wine in its class is that the acidity is mellow, not shrill as is often the case.",Bonarda
Argentina,"Begins with leather, earth and stewed plum aromas. The body is big and manly, with smooth tannins and a chunky mouthfeel. Flavors of plum, berry and rhubarb are lively, accented by a touch of milk chocolate.",Shiraz
Argentina,"This Malbec is easy, ripe, stylish and 100% attractive. The plump black fruit is distinguished and solid, while the mouthfeel is tight yet proper, with good tannic structure and pulsing acidity. Drink now through 2008. Imported by Winesellers Ltd.",Malbec
Argentina,"Spicy and woody at first, with tons of black fruit. The nose shows a hint of dill, but for the most part the wine's pure and full of plum, blackberry, vanilla and good tannins. Firm and loaded, with cola on the finish. Yet another success in Trapiche's new line of old-vine, single-vineyard Malbecs. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Malbec
Argentina,"Even if this full-bodied Cab starts with some eggy, pastry-like aromas, it soon finds its form. The nose brings char and baked black fruit, while the palate is full of creamy blackberry and brown sugar flavors. Rather rich and ripe, with medium tannins and mild acidity. Drink sooner than later.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Mauricio Lorca makes wine for Enrique Foster but his private label is something to keep an eye on. Poetico is potent and fairly pure; and it contains 10% Cabernet and 5% Syrah in addition to 85% Malbec. The palate delivers hearty blackberry, plum and vanilla flavors, while the finish is sturdy as a statue, with length and firm tannins.",Malbec
Argentina,"Powerfully oaked, with initial aromas of cedar shavings and asphalt. Airing softens it up, revealing black cherry, smoke, leather and protruding, firm tannins.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sports a dark luster, with large, equally black aromas that match the robust color. Mouthfeel is where this wine racks up its points; the palate is plush and rich. Flavorwise, you get plum and berry riding on a wave of sharp acidity.",Malbec
Argentina,"Ripe and cushy, with deeply defined fruit aromas that carry enough soft touches to make you want to dig in. Delicate but daring on the palate, with chocolate notes darkening the cassis and cherry flavors. Very round and exceedingly mouthfilling. Imported by Kysela Père et Fils.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Gets going with aromas of molasses, black olive and pencil lead, which accent the rich black fruit that's prominently on display. Intense in the mouth, where dark plum and black cherry dominate. The mouthfeel is ripe and warm, and the finishing notes of licorice, chocolate and coffee are sturdy and refined. Imported by Tastings Import Company.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"A bit of marmalade and violets accent the bold, dark nose. Not at all subtle, with syrupy berry flavors offset by a whack of bitter chocolate. Full-bodied, with chewy tannins and plenty of oak on the finish. A ripe, untamed, candied wine that will settle with more bottle age. Imported by Dourthe USA.",Red Blend
Argentina,"In the past this was a Bordeaux blend but now it's all or almost all Malbec. And because it hails from cooler Tupungato it features floral aromas more than heavy berry scents, and in the mouth it's all about red fruit as opposed to beefy black fruit. If it's a bit short on the finish, chalk that up to its racier, more streamlined frame.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pure, jammy and heady: voilà, it's modern Malbec. The palate here is inviting, with decadent plum and blackberry flavors working in tandem. The finish is plush at first, with chocolate and espresso notes coming later. With plenty of virtues, this is a very nice wine from an average vintage.",Malbec
Argentina,"Pretty on the nose, as the violet, cocoa and subtle fruit tones work well together. The palate is juicy, typically acidic and penetrating. A long finish that's clean but a bit thin closes the show. Displays some spiky qualities, primarily sharp acidity.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Purple in color, with potent berry aromas. The blend is 65% in favor of Malbec, and the wine boasts black raspberry and plum flavors. Finishes hefty and warm, with notes of cola.",Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec
Argentina,"Attractive mint, blackberry, leather and earth scents precede a chewy palate bulked up by thick plum and blackberry flavors. The mouthfeel is round and soft, although some tannin pokes through to spike it up. Finishes with vanilla, coffee and mocha.",Cabernet Blend
Argentina,"Nice color and plenty of fruit on the nose add up to a welcome mat. The palate deals berry fruit galore, especially raspberry, cassis and black cherry. Juicy but still a little plump on the finish, with overall balance equal to that of a dancer. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Fast becoming one of Argentina's most reliable value brands, Altosur got it right in 2006 with its basic Malbec. The wine is full, chewy, healthy and bright. It has all the attributes of good, young Malbec: plums, berries and chocolate, with lushness and some style.",Malbec
Argentina,"Starts out sort of soft and shy, with modest red-fruit aromas. In the mouth, raspberry and cherry flavors get a quick lift from grabby, firm tannins. And by the time this baby hits its groove you're onto a finish defined by a starchy feel and long-lasting Cabernet essence. Airing is this wine's best friend; decant or drink over time.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"The bouquet is fairly tight, with aromas of coffee, crushed minerals, crude oil and fine herbs. The palate runs snappier than most high-end Malbecs, but it also delivers on the promise of ripeness and black-fruit flavors. Finishes in healthy fashion, with some slickness and speed. Very nice and likely even better with food. 1,000 cases made. Imported by Slocum & Sons.",Malbec
Argentina,"Overt and akin in some ways to Gewurztraminer. Flowery, lemony and fairly ebullient. Driving acidity keeps it fresh, and it tails away with a dry, soda-like snap. But drink soon; it's not getting younger.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Lively, with young legs. The bouquet blasts forth with lemon curd and ripe apple aromas, which are followed by a plump yet racy palate full of spicy apple, pear and mild mineral notes. Not meant for the long haul.",Viognier
Argentina,"Gets going with mocha, coffee and other oak-based aromas. The flavor profile is developed and fruity, emphasizing plum, blackberry and raspberry. Plenty of pop and a tight, mouth-filling finish make it lively.",Syrah
Argentina,"Here's a nice wine that pushes the right buttons while not raising any red flags. Raspberry and vanilla flavors are solid and pleasing, while the medium-weight palate features depth and balance. This is not the richest, most overpowering Malbec you'll find, but it comes from 75-year-old vines and its virtues far outdistance its faults.",Malbec
Argentina,"Quite earthy and ripe, as tree bark, leather and prune make up the bouquet. The mouth is lively and snappy, with red fruit taking over and holding reign. Sheer, zesty and juicy describes the mouthfeel, while overall the wine delivers depth and integrity. Not overly complex but very good and straightforward.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"On the nose, smooth berry aromas turn chocolaty courtesy of the high-toast barrels used. In the mouth, the plump fruit seems up to the oak. There's raspberry and raisin, and some blueberry, too. For the curious, Altos de Medrano is the winery and hormigas, in Spanish, are ants. Fortunately, I've seen no such critters at the winery.",Malbec
Argentina,"A toasty, milky creaminess plays heavily on the bouquet, and in the mouth there's a lot of coconut. Sharp acidity pushes pineapple and green-apple characteristics. Has its virtues, but awkward at all points.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Light berry aromas and flavors make up this simple quaffer that nonetheless offers enough substance to satisfy. Similar to Côte du Rhône; it closes with licorice notes and sweet, creamy oak. Of interest, Flichman made one of Argentina's very first Syrahs back in 1974.",Syrah
Argentina,"For some time now this wine has been the measuring stick for Argentine Viognier, and the '05 vintage is one of the best yet. Mineral, melon and peaches coat the bouquet, while the balanced palate is full of sweet melon flavors. This is a warm, ripe, slightly creamy wine that's meant to be drunk as soon as possible, before it loses steam. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Viognier
Argentina,"Broquel is Trapiche's higher-end label, and generally speaking this Chardonnay is one of the best Argentineans going. Yes, there's a heavy dose of wood, but with time it meshes nicely into the apple, melon and citrus fruit that's prominently on display. Pure on the finish, with forward acidity. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"The color is a rich gold hue, while the nose offers a collection of apple, cinnamon, mineral and toast. This is a full-bodied and well-made wine, with baked-fruit flavors offset by spice and white pepper. Then it finishes creamy and sweet, highlighting toffee, caramel and vanilla. With proper weight and acids, it's balanced. Imported by Kysela Père et Fils.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Smooth and ripe, with a sweet, doughy character to the nose. Ripe, lush and healthy, with cassis and chocolate oozing off the palate. For the money this is rock-solid Malbec, saturated and chewy, with ample tannins. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big and ripe, with chewy fruit and a lot of plum and blackberry character. At 15.3% it hides its alcohol amid berry, cassis and black-pepper flavors. Modern in style, with tannin and texture. Very nice and fairly natural despite its heft.",Merlot
Argentina,"Earthy and ripe, with lots of black cherry and raspberry on both the bouquet and palate. Comes on equally juicy and smooth, with good length on the back end and plenty of acidity to push the flavor. Balanced and on the money. Imported by Stanza.",Malbec
Argentina,"Bright boysenberry aromas offer a touch of sugar beet and perfume, while the palate is all about jammy berry flavors with dark, lush shadings. Firm on the finish, with no holes to speak of. Undeniably ripe, with a good feel and plenty of richness. Imported by The Global Vineyard.",Malbec
Argentina,"With its vanilla and caramel accents on pure pear and apple fruit, this is a good, basic Argentinean Chard. The palate is clean and forward, with solid apple forming the framework. Shows just enough butter and toast to warm it up, but it's not a heavy wine. Smooth and easy. Imported by Winesellers Ltd.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Dry and bit herbal, with red-fruit aromas and a spot of green. The palate deals good red-berry flavor with accents of black pepper and vanilla. Persistent on the finish, with moderate tannic grab. Streamlined but not what you'd call thin. Imported by Broadbent Selections, Inc.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"Dark as night, with a rich, round, deep nose. Overt on the palate, with cherry, blackberry and plum. Juicy enough, with chewy tannins and firm acidity. Beefy enough to match with any meat and dark enough to substitute for paint. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Malbec
Argentina,"Ripe and plummy, with blackberry on the inviting nose. Sizable on the palate, with raspberry and cassis in spades. Wholesome and nice, with no noticeable flaws. Good, affordable Cabernet doesn't come around every day, but this is an exception to the rule. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Quite good for the money, with mild coconut and caramel aromas on top of berry fruit. The palate is ripe and sweet, with cinnamon, chocolate and coffee notes mingling with berries and currants. Shows the slightest hint of grass at the core but overall it's very good. Imported by Victoire Imports.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Ripe, tight and fresh, this is what everyday Merlot should be like. There's some roast meat and leather atop cherry on the nose, and behind that there's black fruit, leather, bacon and pepper flavors. A totally legitimate table wine for a good price.",Merlot
Argentina,"Spicy and alluring, with molasses, earth and barbecue on the nose. Bold blackberry, plum and cough syrup work the palate, while the finish is tannic and firm. Not particularly plush, but lively and tasty. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Light on the nose, with modest peach and apple. Apple, pineapple and a touch of toast carry the palate, which is clean and acid-based. Arguably a touch sweet, but overall it's a good South American Chardonnay. Imported by Tastings Import Company.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A bit of burnt character clouds the grapy nose, but it's not a heavy, overoaked wine. In fact, the palate is a touch tangy, with zesty black cherry and a decent amount of protruding acidity. Rigid but solid, with full fruit flavors. Imported by Epic Wines.",Malbec
Argentina,"This is a traditional-styled Malbec, one with leaner cherry and raspberry fruit as opposed to heavy blackberry. It's a bit racy and acidic, but it's stylish as well. Big enough to satisfy but complex enough to intrigue. Imported by Dylain Produce, LLC.",Malbec
Argentina,"This Malbec-Tempranillo blend is trying to be one of those new-wave super bruisers and it achieves that goal, but only to a point. It's big, round, savory and lush, but it's shallow in the midsection because it lacks acidity and punch. Beefy but incomplete. Imported by Winesellers Ltd.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Heady and well choreographed, with roasted sweet aromas to get things going. Some char and weight appear next, setting up solid cherry and blackberry flavors. Juicy, ripe and structured. An unusual blend that works nicely. Imported by Billington Imports.",Malbec-Syrah
Argentina,"Peach, melon and apple carry the clean but ordinary bouquet, and behind that comes a round palate full of ripe banana, pear, caramel and vanilla. Fully oaked but not overdone, with toast on the finish. Good Argentine Chardonnay. Imported by Billington Imports.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Very oaky, with a can't-miss scent of butter, and also some maple. Sweet and syrupy on first take but then it settles down to deliver licorice, cooked brown sugar and toast. What's best about this wine is its feel.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Big and fruity, with notes of rubber and graphite on the bouquet. Textured and pretty full-bodied, the berry, cassis and pepper flavors come across as dedicated and real. Kind of short and basic on the finish, but by then it has made its point.",Merlot
Argentina,"Dry and full of savory plum and spice aromas. With zesty and developed raspberry and cherry flavors along with a mostly fresh and balanced mouthfeel, this is a pretty good bargain Merlot.",Merlot
Argentina,"Closed and heavy on the nose, with baked-apple flavors and caramel. Weighs in as full-bodied, with toffee and bitter pith notes on the finish. Aims fairly high and delivers up to an extent: there's size and substance but also some overripeness, corn and pith. Not perfect, but not bad. Imported by Billington Imports.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Intensely colored and miles better than the label's troubled basic Tempranillo, this is an Argentinean rendition of Spain's workhorse grape that showcases berry and plum flavors, plenty of oak and ample chocolate and espresso on the finish. More impressive when taken as a whole; best to drink with barbecue and not get too analytical.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Here's an inexpensive wine that delivers tasty pear and melon flavors. The body is solid, maybe a bit hefty, but there's enough acidity to keep it on track. Easygoing stuff with no surprises. Imported by Hemingway & Hale.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Fairly oaky, as the name might indicate. Flavors of lemon, apple and pineapple are complete, if a bit common, while the feel is round and a touch resiny. Finishes solid, with a modicum of butter. On the heavier side, but acidic enough to maintain its balance. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Although it kicks off on the stewy, baked side of the fence, airing reveals good fruit and ample wood; indeed, there's brandied cherry, vanilla and chocolate to ponder. Long on the finish, albeit a finish that's one-note simple. A little stark in terms of feel.",Merlot
Argentina,"Raspberry, bramble and leather are convincing opening aromas, while the ripe black cherry on the palate is spiced up by some light wood notes. Textured on the tongue, with vanilla and cherry notes to the finish. Not all that Syrah-like, but good as red wine goes.",Syrah
Argentina,"A Cabernet that resides on the dark side. The nose is baked and earthy, with coffee notes. Dark plum and chocolate flavors run wild on the tannic palate, while the lengthy finish is slightly bitter with the taste of espresso. Imported by Epic Wines.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Sweet and rooty on the nose, with hints of cola and earth. This is a solid red wine, with plum, berry and some mild astringency to the palate. Finishes a bit tart but still makes it to the quality level. Likely better with food than by itself.",Merlot
Argentina,"This blend of Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon is very woody, so much so that the nose offers mostly cinnamon and green lumber. The palate, however, is ultracreamy, with vanilla and milk chocolate running the show. Seems a bit sticky and oaky. Could use more uncut fruit. Imported by Epic Wines.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Lightweight in its approach, but still sturdy. The bouquet offers melon, tropical notes and white flowers, while the palate deals mostly cantaloupe and banana. A modestly oaked wine without a ton of stuffing. Good for basic sipping. Imported by Billington Imports.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Standard fare, but nice. The nose offers some burnt sugar in addition to black fruit, while the palate is full of plum, cherry and spice. Chocolate and vanilla are detectable on the medium-length finish, while the feel and balance are proper.",Syrah
Argentina,"Violet in color, with sweet lilac, plum and graham cracker aromas. A fruitball of the first order, but one that's ripe and balanced. The palate pours on blackberry and chocolate in spades, while the tannins and acids meet in the middle. Imported by Testa Wines of the World.",Malbec
Argentina,"Sweet from the start, with maple and pear on the bouquet. More soft than sturdy, with a candied palate that offers round, almost sugary citrus flavors. Easy for a glass or two, but without the voltage to go further.",Sparkling Blend
Argentina,"Gold in color and on the dry, waxy side. Shows mineral and dried fruits on the nose, with heavy pear and apple bulking up the palate. Finishes short, with some pithy bitterness. But good overall, with a roundness that's appealing. Imported by South Valley Wines.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A little bit of bramble and green  on the nose, but by and large this wine is solid. The palate offers sweetness and brown sugar along with zesty fruit, while the tannic structure and persistence are unavoidable. Imported by Victoire Imports.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Dark and harmonious, with a heavy coating of toast on the nose. Round, meaty, colorful and rich, with jammy plum and berry flavors coasting on a cuddly, easy body. A fairly big Malbec with just enough spice and charred character to balance it off. Imported by Kysela Père et Fils.",Malbec
Argentina,"The nose offers hints of rubber and smoked meat, but the fruit is difficult to peg. The mouth is ripe enough, with notes of blackberry and chocolate. Mouthcoating, but with soft tannins.",Merlot
Argentina,"The nose bears a strong resemblance to canned fruit, particularly peaches. The palate offers some zesty nectarine and even more fruit cocktail. Moderately snappy, with some solid core acidity. The blend is 50% Chardonnay and 50% Viognier. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Chardonnay-Viognier
Argentina,"Chunky and on the verge of overripe, with soft peach and melon aromas. Additional peach and melon flavors define the overweight palate, while the finish is heavy but flavorful. Tasty stuff with merits, but its lifespan is going to be short. Imported by 57 Main Street Wine Co.",Viognier
Argentina,"Flowery and lively, with apple and mild citrus flavors. More than decent on the tongue, with good balance. More steady and solid than spectacular, with varietal correctness and ample weight.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A bit of pumpkin and squash on the early nose, with apple coming later. Comes across with orange and honey on the palate, and there's soft melon on the finish. Sort of sweet but it works.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Full barrique aromas work great with the wine's overriding ripe, rubbery black fruit. Aromas of lemon peel, char and pulsing berry lead toward lively raspberry, plum and herb flavors.  Smooth and well rounded. An elevated wine. Imported by Quintessential LLC.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Simple and floral; not concentrated. This lightweight is tasty enough and overall it's balanced. The palate deals citrus, melon and crispness, and the feel is lively and juicy. Tastes more like Spanish Albariño than Chardonnay.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Ruby in color, with attractive mint, leather and black-fruit aromas. Like all Andeluna reds, which are made by the talented Silvio Alberto, it is ripe and lush; the black cherry, raspberry and chocolate flavors satisfy on their way to a toasted, smooth finish. Cushy and right for the times, and a bargain given that we're talking Cabernet Sauvignon.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Full and toasty, with medium depth of fruit but a lot of friendliness. Forward in the mouth, with pretty black cherry and plum flavors that are warm and ride smoothly on a bed of solid tannins. Well knit and solid. Offers a lot for the money. A good by-the-glass red. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Malbec
Argentina,"Full, dense and powerful is this blend of Malbec and Cabernet, but it's also ultraripe and loaded with new oak. Earth, cola and blackberry are all attractive aromas, while the berry fruit is commendable. Where this wine slumps, if you can say that, is in the complexity department; it seems almost too simple and easy. Imported by Banville & Jones Wine Merchants.",Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Here's a good but rugged blend of Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet that starts out with smoked meat, rubber and pure red-fruit aromas. The feel may seem a touch hard if sipped alone, but with food it will sing a pretty tune. On the finish it's burly and tannic, but it's healthy as can be and should age nicely for several years. Imported by William Harrison Imports.",Red Blend
Argentina,"Blueberry jam and some violet-like aromas get it off the mark, with plum and black cherry flavors playing second fiddle. Mildly tart and zesty in terms of feel, with a light finish. Mainstream all the way.",Shiraz
Argentina,"Moderately fruity on the nose, with a hint of leafiness and pickle. Raspberry and strawberry flavors are generally sweet, while the feel is a bit on the sharp side. Simple and straightforward, but with hardly any recognizable Shiraz character.",Shiraz
Argentina,"So woody at first you'd think you had entered a sawmill, but with time it settles down. Red berries, milk chocolate and wood spice work the palate, followed by lean fruit leftovers and vanilla.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Pickled at first, while oak comes on strong as it airs out. The palate shows a lot of butter and toast, with only mild fruit hanging out in the background. Dry and short in the long run.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Ordinary plum and berry aromas to start, followed by a more jammy palate that tastes of berry compote. A touch of chocolate and pepper carry the finish. All totaled this is decent wine with middle-of-the-road characteristics.",Shiraz
Argentina,"This wine is rock solid and well worth a go. The nose is smoky, rubbery and full of fruit. In the mouth, vanilla softens and supports pure plum and cherry flavors. Mouthfilling and balanced. If only all value wines were this well made. Imported by Dylain Produce, LLC.",Syrah
Argentina,"Probably this winery's best current release; the nose is forward, spicy, fruity and convincing. Follow that with bright cherry and berry flavors along with a finish that's got medium tannins in support of spice and coffee, and you have a well-priced winner. What affordable red wine was meant to be.",Merlot
Argentina,"Speechless at first as the nose offers very little. The mouth offers basic dark fruit with some tannins. Grabby at first, but better as it opens up. Rubbery but fairly ripe.",Malbec
Argentina,"Starts with apple covered in oak-based caramel and vanilla, but loses its focus as it evolves. The palate is a mishmash of melon, citrus and papaya, while the overall take is that its less than stellar but not offensive. In this case, the organic qualifier isn't a boost.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Ripe, jammy and forward, with very little besides heavy berry fruit to offer. The palate is overtly oaky, with butter and wood notes. Grapy and a raw in the middle, with some displaced tannins.",Merlot
Argentina,"A big blast of oak rises up from the glass, a barrier to what fruit might lie below. Once you get to the palate, there's tight but somewhat tart raspberry and a touch of leather. Not nearly as ripe and rich as the oak on the nose calls for; thus the end result is almost sour, which isn't an attribute when it comes to Malbec.",Malbec
Argentina,"Roasted and deep at first, which is encouraging. But it doesn't really stand the test, showing tart plum and berry flavors, out-of-place tannin and shortness on the palate. Finishes too thin and hard.",Merlot
Argentina,"Round, ripe and showing no cracks, although there is a touch of dill weed on the nose that's not altogether unwelcome. The palate is forward and standard, with ripe plum and berry flavors. Fairly squat and tannic on the finish, with a full mouthfeel. Imported by Tastings Import Company.",Malbec
Argentina,"Heavy and flat, with dull apple aromas. The palate delivers simple yellow fruit, while the finish is soft and devoid of spunk. There isn't a whole lot more to say about this wine; it's a cipher.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Good color but the nose and palate don't offer that Cabernet lushness that most of us seek. The red-fruit nose is kind of lean, probably a reflection of Patagonia's cool climate. And the palate is peppery and starchy, with hard tannins.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Light and candied, with strawberry drink mix as the main aroma. In the mouth, it's rather sticky and sweet, with basic characteristics. Adequate in terms of feel and balance.",Merlot
Argentina,"Not a whole lot to say about the soft, flat nose. It's o.k., but that's really about it. The palate, meanwhile, turns sweet, nearly to the point of candied. And the finish is downright sugary. Decent weight and feel help it along.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Jumbled, with sweet, soft fruit that is sugary and quite strange. Not exactly off the mark but a hard wine to like. It's sweet and candied and unfocused.",Malbec
Argentina,"Awkward, with early aromatics akin to sauerkraut. Airing doesn't totally shake that funky character, and the fruit seems on the cooked side. Acceptable mouthfeel. Imported by Winesellers Ltd.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"A lot of raisin and heavy cola aromas weigh down the bouquet in front of reduced, almost condensed baked-fruit flavors. A stewy wine with a saving streak of acidity in the middle tier.",Merlot
Argentina,"Round, red, ripe and rubbery. It weighs in at 14% but seems like a mystery wine when tasted blind. Yields little Pinot character but as generic red wine it's acceptable. Tastes mostly of anonymous berry and chocolate.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Nondescript in terms of fruit flavors, with a strong hint of green pepper. Decent feel and length, with spice. But just too much green character to score better.",Merlot
Argentina,"Solid from start to finish, with bramble and spice on the nose along with ripe plum and berry compote. Easy, basic and satisfying on the palate, where full dark-fruit flavors get a boost from subtle, appropriate oak. Medium density and concentration make it a wine to drink now. Imported by Dylain Produce, LLC.",Syrah
Argentina,"Overtly floral and jumpy, with potent aromas of perfume. Heavy in the mouth, with odd, bland flavors of applesauce and spice. Soft and sticky.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Sweet as can be, with strong aromas of talcum powder and air freshener. Rather lean in the mouth, with a watery, processed flavor profile. Not awful but not much to write home about.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Saucy and herbal, with leather and citrus peel on the nose. Heavy and undistinguished on the palate, with atypical plum and blackberry flavors. Hard to identify as Pinot Noir.",Pinot Noir
Argentina,"Granular and reduced on the nose, with bulky fruit flavors and an awkward mouthfeel. Finishes rather heavy and a bit burnt.",Merlot
Argentina,"Transparent in color, with bubblegum and candied fruit on the nose. Sweet and rubbery on the palate, with a lean, burnt personality. Not horrible but surely nothing to rave about.",Tempranillo
Argentina,"Green and austere, with burnt grass on the nose and palate. Cranberry fruit is sharp; not a prime-timer. Barely acceptable.",Malbec
Argentina,"Fresh, tropical, and welcoming. Sweet and lush in the mouth with a full blast of mango and melon flavors. Medium-bodied with good acidity. Finishes correct and everything seems to be united and put together. Above-average value Chardonnay from Argentina.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Fresh, tropical, and welcoming. Sweet and lush in the mouth with a full blast of mango and melon flavors. Medium-bodied with good acidity. Finishes correct and everything seems to be united and put together. Above-average value Chardonnay from Argentina.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Young and disjointed at first, the nose finally settles on almond paste and berry syrup. This is Andeluna's most pricey wine, and while it delivers deep plum and blackberry followed by a smoky coffee and chocolate-tinged finish, it's grabby and awkward. Good but not a star. Imported by Kysela Père et Fils.",Cabernet Franc
Argentina,"Open, friendly aromas of black cherry, sugar beet, violets and talcum powder start this wine on a nice, simple, satisfying path. Tastes of blueberry, cherry and pretty much all the berry and tree fruits you can think of. Ripe and sweet on the finish. By the book. Imported by Stanza.",Malbec
Argentina,"Purple and large, and that makes it easy to peg as young. With so much color and extract the palate can only be big, and it's holding rich, almost syrupy blackberry flavors that are mountainous but unrefined. Imported by William Harrison Imports.",Malbec
Argentina,"Easy, light and mildly candied, with pure cherry and berry aromas. Cherry and raspberry flavors are ripe and open, with good balance. Not the deepest, most dense wine on the market but classy and solid. Good for the money. Imported by Winesellers Ltd.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"This is an active, zesty Torrontès, which is the best way to find it. Grapefruit and fresh celery are intertwined on the nose, while fresh apple and citrus fruits work the palate. Totally clean and easy.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Floral as always, with pineapple and lemon aromas. Lemon-lime is the lead player on the palate, with freshness present throughout. Has good feel and balance but limited depth of flavor and almost no complexity. An easy drinker.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Smooth and lifted, with bold berry aromas backed by strong lemony oak. Plum and boysenberry form a solid foundation, and off that you get texture and chocolate. Tight, tannic and with far more good qualities than bad. Imported by Paterno Wines International.",Malbec
Argentina,"Aggressive and oaky, with lactic aromas as well as heavy burnt-toast notes. This is Trapiche's flagship blend of Cabernet and Malbec, and every year it seems less than up to its price. The '03 version is tart in the middle, with a ton of tannin and raw wood. Maybe it'll round into form with time in the cellar. But maybe not. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Merlot-Malbec
Argentina,"Clean, light and fresh; it's the perfect white wine for a picnic. Lithe, lucid flavors of tangerine and pink grapefruit are sweet and ripe, and worthwhile. The stony, citric tail is good, too.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Black cherry mixes with raisin on the dark, meaty nose. Additional black cherry and plum flavors are thick and a bit prune-based, but if you enjoy ripeness you'll like the style. Bitter chocolate and toast carry the finish. Imported by Wine Source Selections.",Malbec
Argentina,"An Argentinean Tannat that strikes a lot of good chords. The nose is full of blackberry and prune, while the palate seems racy courtesy of core acidity that can't be shaken. Good for those eager to expand their wine horizons. It's both dark and jumpy.",Tannat
Argentina,"Fairly serious for a value wine, with touches of spice, mint and dark fruit on the bouquet. The palate features solid red-fruit flavors that may be stretched thin but are good nonetheless. Snappy, upright and just solid enough. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Bright and open, and for the most part everything about this easygoing red is pleasant. Tasty plum and raspberry flavors are simple but ripe, while the overall expression is balanced and measured. Finishes with some sweet chocolate and vanilla for good measure.",Merlot
Argentina,"Not sure why this 1999 would still be on the market as a current release, but at the very least it shows that Malbec ages fairly well. The nose is still largely fresh, while the red fruit flavors fall into the raspberry, plum and cassis category. Not terribly lush but solid. Imported by The Wandering Epicurean.",Malbec
Argentina,"Why this vintage is so much more monotone and raisiny than the lovely '02 is anyone's guess. However, that's the case. The nose starts out with game and bacon but it shifts to raisin and prune with airing. The palate, meanwhile, is also lively at first and then goes raisiny. Very dark but it settles on a single plane and then stays there. Tannic as well. Imported by Testa Wines of the World.",Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Argentina,"The label says fumé and the nose leaves no doubt that the wine was barrel aged because cinnamon and toast are all over it. Yet the flavor profile is rather tangy, with mango and apple leading the way. Holds form on the finish. Not a common style for Sauvignon Blanc.",Sauvignon Blanc
Argentina,"Kind of reedy and covered with a veneer of wood that holds in the red cherry and raspberry aromas and flavors. Feels lean and wispy on the palate, where a bell pepper note creeps into the picture. Loses body the longer it sits.",Merlot
Argentina,"Lots of clove and oak on the nose, with some green aromas and coffee bean. Core black cherry with spice shadings carries the palate, while the finish is constricted and mildly tannic. Fairly hard in terms of mouthfeel. Imported by Oenophilia Imports.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Full plum and raspberry aromas are not overpowering, but they are big and set the stage for plum, coffee and pepper flavor components. Displays a bit of heat and bitterness late on the finish, but for the most part this wine is varietally correct and tastes not unlike a sun-drenched Côtes-du-Rhône. Imported by Ecosur Group, LLC.",Shiraz
Argentina,"Not unkind aromas of bath oil and flowers set the stage for slightly pithy citrus and melon flavors. Registers as chunky in the mouth, with additional pith and a slight bitterness to the finish. Pretty good overall.",Torrontés
Argentina,"Standard aromas in the berry and beet range is what you get on the nose. The body hits hard on the palate, where the fruit flavors seem rugged, juicy and a bit tangy. Settles on the finish, offering clarity in a tight, modest package. Imported by Biagio Cru & Estate Wines, LLC.",Syrah
Argentina,"Yellowish in color, with a heavy, somewhat creamy nose that deals vanilla and melon. More sweet vanilla is woven into the anonymous fruit flavors, while slight oakiness rears up on the finish. Not bad but oaky and unfocused.",Chardonnay
Argentina,"Dark and dense, with extracted black cherry, leather and earth aromas. Shows a ton of body and darkness but only limited flavors. Chocolate and vanilla appear on the finish, but there's also a blast of green to bring it down. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Malbec
Argentina,"Big and dark, with smoked meat and bacon aromas sitting side by side with damp, soupy notes. Has its strong points, such as the dark plum and bacon flavors and the wideness of the finish. Strikes against include extra hard tannins that result in a scouring, lasting feel. Imported by Ecosur Group, LLC.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Argentina,"Heavy and basic, with melon and pineapple aromas. Full-flavored with a ton of apple and cinnamon character. Made in the round, fruit-forward style. Not a complex, overly serious wine. A solid quaffer.",Sauvignon Blanc
